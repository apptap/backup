    </font><font FACE="CG Times,Times New Roman"><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The golden age of
    Police Immunity&quot;</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that in the early to mid-1990's most
    practitioners in this area of law considered that the Police were effectively immune from
    all actions based upon harm indirectly caused to Claimants where the police had, at the
    relevant time, been engaged in detecting and suppressing crime. The importance which
    society attached to the efficient functioning of the Police was such that imposing civil
    liability for their acts when they were so engaged was contrary to the public interest. Of
    course striking out such a claim is highly attractive since claims against the police are
    almost invariably brought by legally aided plaintiffs, and one of the principal policy
    considerations identified by the Courts was the need to prevent police resources (time and
    money) being diverted from the fight against crime.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So that where a criminal had been allowed to remain at large (<i>Hill</i>),
    a property improperly checked following an alarm call (<i>Alexandrou</i>), or a road
    hazzard left to await the unwitting motorist (<i>Ancell</i> and <i>Clough</i>) the Chief
    Constables advisers did not concern themselves with the merits of any particular claim -
    secure in the knowledge that they were effectively bomb-proof. This lecture address the
    question : to what extent have the decisions in <i>Swinney, Costello and Osman</i> altered
    the extent of the immunity. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For reasons I shall explain I would suggest that none of the three
    recent decisions would alter the outcome of the particular cases set out above since all
    of them involved claims brought by persons who were part of a large class of potential
    claimants, in no particular special relationship with the Police. These cases can
    therefore be viewed as coming within the &quot;proximity&quot; ratio of <i>Hill</i>.</p>
  </font></blockquote>
</blockquote><font FACE="CG Times,Times New Roman">

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as indicated, many of us believed that the immunity extended
    far wider than those cases which involve claims by members of such a class of individuals.
    We believed that what may be termed the &quot;policy&quot; ratio of <i>Hill</i>
    effectively provided an almost complete shield against actions based upon indirect harm
    arising out of police actions or omissions occurring in the course of their duty to detect
    and suppress crime. That Lord Keith in <i>Hill </i>intended the &quot;policy&quot; ratio
    to be separate and independent of any &quot;proximity&quot; point between the Police and
    claimant cannot sensibly be doubted. 3 of their Lordships concurred with his Judgement.
    Lord Templeman appears to have gone even further basing his judgment solely on grounds of
    public policy.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before considering the recent decisions it is worth considering, by way
    of background, the nature of an &quot;immunity&quot; afforded by the courts to a
    defendant. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any immunity effectively acts as a &quot;control mechanism&quot;
    limiting liability usually where the Courts feel that affording a class of claimants a
    remedy is not in the public interest, would open the floodgates or would expose a
    Defendant to indefinite liability to an indeterminate class of Plaintiff for an unlimited
    amount. All control mechanisms create a tension when they are felt to operate in such a
    way as to exclude from justice deserving claimants. Thus over time appellate decisions
    will modify and limit the scope of the control mechanism and often you will find the
    judges in such cases expressing their decisions in terms of the public&#146;s perception
    of justice. A classic example from a different series of negligence cases is Lord
    Goff&#146;s judgment in <i>White v Jones</i> (the solicitor&#146;s negligence case). The
    control mechanism in this case was the principle that a solicitor&#146;s duty of care was
    owed to his client, not third parties who might be adversely effected by negligent advice
    given to that client. Lord Goff having described (at some length) the &quot;impulse to do
    practical justice&quot; and having explained why the prospect of a negligent solicitor
    effectively &quot;getting away with it&quot; - simply because he owed no duty to the one
    person who suffered a loss - would to him be an &quot;<i>extraordinary fact&quot;</i> and
    went on to hold :</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;...it seems to me open to your Lordships to fashion a remedy
        to fill a lacuna in the law so as to prevent injustice which would otherwise occur on the
        facts of cases such as the present...&quot;</p>
      </i></blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <i>
    </i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the &quot;lacuna&quot; in question arose because of
    the application of well established principle was no impediment to judicial creativity.
    Such pronouncements do not sit easy with wide ranging immunities, and eventually such
    immunities are eroded by judicial creativity aimed at preventing a deserving claimant
    being excluded from justice. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so just as the last two decades have seen the absolute bar to the
    recovery of purely economic loss gradually chipped away to the point where it now a far
    less effective control upon recovery, so it was perhaps inevitable that the immunity in <i>Hill</i>
    could not remain the all encompassing shield that some of us imagined it to be. </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The practical effect of the three recent decisions : <i>Swinney</i>,
    <i>Osman </i>and <i>Costello</i>.</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that it is no co-incidence that each of these three cases
    involve what may be termed &quot;attractive&quot; claims - that is claims where the
    general public may well regard it is as unjust for a claimant to be denied a remedy. In
    considering each of these cases I shall set out as precisely as possible the nature of
    duty of care as defined by the courts and suggest how this will be applied in practice,
    with some examples. You may also detect that I consider two of these decisions to have
    been wrongly decided.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1 Swinney v The Chief Constable of Northumbria Police [1997] Q.B.
    464 and Swinney v The Chief Constable of Northumbria Police (No 2) the Times May 25<sup>th</sup>
    1999.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A licencee had provided information to the Police which purported to
    identify suspects in a murder enquiry. When she had done so she had expressly stipulated
    that the information was to be treated &quot;in confidence&quot; as she feared reprisals.
    The information was stored on a Data management system and subsequently a written
    instruction to an officer to carry out further investigation into the information was
    printed and issued. The print out identified the licencee and specified the information
    she had supplied. The print out was stolen from a locked police patrol car and shortly
    after the theft the licencee and her husband were subjected to threats purportedly made on
    behalf of those named by her.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was first instructed on behalf of the police in about 1993 it
    seemed to me that there was a strong case for striking the claim out. The Police were
    actively engaged in a murder enquiry. They had created a document in accordance with
    standard procedures laid down by the Home Office - using the &quot;HOLMES&quot; data
    management system. The Claimant was seeking to interfere with Police methods and
    procedures - and indeed the Statement of Claim contained a number of suggested alternative
    methods for controlling the data (it alleged the data should have been stored in an
    officer&#146;s pocket notebook or maned police station). The harm had been caused by the
    deliberate actions of criminals not under the control of the Police. Indeed the Police
    themselves had been victims of the theft. If such a claim were allowed there would a large
    number of potential claimants with little prospect of limiting such claims. Hundreds of
    thousands of people provide information to the police &quot;in confidence&quot; annually.
    Witness intimidation and reprisals by criminals is a growing problem. If the Police were
    to be prevented from leaving sensitive documents in locked patrol cars for short periods
    then they would be hindered in their task of suppressing crime. The implications of
    liability seemed to me to be far reaching, requiring on the one hand officers to go about
    their duty with one eye on potential civil liability : (do I take this document with me
    now or should I leave it at the station; do I go and apprehend that suspect knowing that
    in doing so I am creating a risk that my car will be broken into and the document stolen)
    and on the other hand involving the Courts in just the sort of ex post facto investigation
    of the reasonableness of the officer&#146;s methods which <i>Hill</i> seemed to prohibit
    (ought this officer to have carried out this investigation in this way, and so on). In
    short whilst the police for their own practical reasons would no doubt wish to keep such
    information confidential, at the end of the day, their prime duty was to get on with the
    task of detecting and suppressing crime, and they were, to paraphrase Lord Keith, to be
    presumed to be using their best endeavours.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However the courts were faced with a highly attractive claim. The
    Claimant could say - I agreed to help the police at significant personal risk to myself. I
    did so on express terms that the fact that I had given this information was to be kept
    confidential. All that I asked in return was that the police would take reasonable care to
    prevent the confidence being broken. The police&#146;s own standing orders and Home Office
    guidance alerted them to the need to take care of such items and required them to do so.
    Statute (the Data Protection Act) made the police liable for unauthorised disclosure
    unless they could demonstrate that they had taken reasonable steps to prevent such
    disclosure. The individual officers would no doubt acknowledge that they would have felt
    it incumbent upon them to take care of such information. Indeed there is not slightest
    doubt officers would, if asked, have said : &quot;of course we regarded it as an important
    part of our duty to do our best to honour Mrs Swinney&#146;s confidence&quot;. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In retrospect the Plaintiff&#146;s arguments were almost bound to carry
    the day. I now have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion not only were the Court of
    Appeal right to hold that the existence of the duty of care was arguable but that Mr
    Justice Jackson was right to hold that it actually arose in this case. Mr Justice Jackson
    held :</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In my judgment, the duty of care owed by the defendant to Mrs
        Swinney should be formulated as follows :</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A duty to take reasonable care to avoid unnecessary disclosure to
        the general public of the information which Mrs Swinney had given to the police.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One matter does perhaps warrant further consideration. As indicated no
    doubt the individual officers would have acknowledged, if asked, a &quot;duty&quot; to
    preserve Mrs Swinney&#146;s confidence. However where that actually takes the case is
    perhaps less clear. A barrister no doubt would acknowledge a &quot;duty&quot; to his
    client but that does not make him liable to him for things said or done in Court. As we
    shall see in <i>Costello </i>considerable significance was attached to the acknowledgement
    by the officer of a duty. However had the senior detective in charge of the Yorkshire
    Ripper investigation been asked no doubt he would have acknowledged a duty, on behalf of
    his force, to the young women of Yorkshire to arrest the perpetrator as soon as possible.
    However such an acknowledgement of a duty would not have altered the outcome in <i>Hill&#146;s
    </i>case, and nor, it is submitted should it be seen as more than a relatively minor
    consideration in other cases.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3 When will such a duty arise?</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly the case is authority that where an &quot;informant&quot;
    expressly provides information in confidence the duty will arise except where the
    information cannot sensibly be regarded as &quot;confidential&quot;. However whether or
    not the request for confidentiality is expressly made I would anticipate that a duty would
    be found where a member of the public supplies information which, if the same became known
    by the subject of that information, would expose that member of the public to a <i>significant</i>
    and <i>foreseeable</i> risk or reprisals. It is, in my view, bound to extend beyond that
    narrow group.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Informers&quot; (that is associates of criminals who supply
    information in return for money or in order to mitigate their sentence) are almost bound
    to be held to be owed the duty since they are normally in a far more vulnerable position
    than the general public and are in a relationship with the police which is analogous to
    contract, and in some cases may even be contractual. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Persons who allow their premises to be used as observation posts will
    almost certainly be owed an analogous duty. I represented the police in an action tried by
    HHJ Norman Jones QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, and conceded the existence of
    such a duty. The police had asked a man if they could use his home to spy on neighbours
    who were known to be violent criminals. He had asked for and received assurances that the
    operation would not be revealed. Although I had pleaded no duty of care and the immunity
    (pre-<i>Swinney</i>) it seemed to me to be untenable to argue that the Police owed such a
    man no duty of care. In fact the Police won on causation, but the Judge found there was a
    duty of care.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would think a duty would be owed to people recruited to entrap
    criminals or to spy on them (eg by means of a secreted listening device on their person).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether you say the basis of such a duty is because there is the sort
    of proximity between the Police and claimant that a special relationship can be said to
    exist (<i>Caparo v Dickman</i>) or because there has been an assumption of responsibility
    and reliance (<i>Hedley Byrne v Heller</i>) is of no practical significance - the result
    is the same. When analalysed in this way <i>Swinney </i>can be regarded as coming within
    the line of cases where there has been held to have been an assumption of responsibility
    to an individual by the police, such as <i>Kirkham</i>, and <i>Reeves</i> (the suicide
    cases), and <i>Rigby </i>(the gas cannister case) and so is not really an extension of the
    law at all.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What remains unaffected by <i>Swinney</i>, it is submitted, are cases
    brought by victims where the Police fail to catch a criminal who goes on to commit further
    crimes. Support for this is contained in <i>Swinney </i>itself - see for example Hirst LJ
    at 483 H where he states :</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The <i>Hill </i>case is, of course, one of cardinal importance.
        As was held in the <i>Alexandrou </i>case and in the <i>Osman</i> case it lays down a
        principle of general application which was not specifically limited to the actual facts of
        that particular case, and nothing I say should be interpreted as in any shape or form
        seeking to undermine that principle. However, in my judgment, that principle </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">cannot be completely divorced from the circumstances highlighted by
        Lord Keith of Kinkel in his judgment, which recurred mutatis mutandis in the <i>Osman</i>
        case and in the <i>Elguzouli-Daf</i> case...</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I also consider that it is at least arguable in the present case
        that, on the facts pleaded on the Statement of Claim ...the police did, in fact, assume a
        responsibility of confidentiality to ... the first plaintiff. If that view should prevail
        it would bring in to play the exception identified by this court in <i>Elguzouli-Daf...&quot;</i></p>
        
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L.J. Peter Gibson emphasised the special relationship between the first
    plaintiff and the police as distinguishing the case from <i>Hill </i>and all three Judges
    were of the view that specific public interest arguments, which they were able to
    identify, arose and which were at least capable of balancing those arguments in favour of
    an immunity.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no proximity/assumption of responsibility nor countervailing
    public policy arguments in the <i>Hill</i>, <i>Alexandrou or Ancell </i>cases and
    therefore those cases remain unaffected. Indeed their Lordships in <i>Swinney </i>were at
    pains to emphasise that they were not casting doubt on the correctness of those decisions.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4 <b>Scope and Breach of the Duty</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one looks at the whole of Mr Justice Jackson&#146;s decision
    in <i>Swinney No 2 </i>(not the skeletal report in the Times) one sees that many of the
    potential concerns which have been voiced on behalf of the police are mitigated in their
    effect.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At page 21 B of the transcript Mr Justice Powell said :</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Thus, the public policy considerations referred to in the
        authorities previously mentioned do not have the effect of excluding a duty of care.
        However, they are relevant in determining both the scope of the duty and the question of
        breach...</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">22 C &quot;...Fifthly, the phrase &quot;reasonable care&quot; properly
        limits the extent of the duty. The Police may have many functions to perform, only one of
        which is the protection of their sources. <i>There is a wide margin within which the
        courts will not interfere with policing decisions</i>... </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">22 F &quot;...<b>Breach of duty.</b> Mr Hytner QC submits that this
        Court is not entitled to evaluate the policies adopted and operational decisions made by
        Northumbria Police in determining whether reasonable care was exercised by the police
        force in this case. These are areas into which the Court should not venture.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In support of this submission Mr Hytner relies in particular on <i>Rigby</i>
        and <i>Hughes</i>.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;<i>Clearly there is a boundary over which this court should not
        step</i>, but for the purposes of this case it is not necessary to decide precisely where
        that boundary lies. On the facts as I have found them, and as are set out in this
        judgment, I am quite satisfied that the police have complied with the duty of care as
        formulated in part 2 of the Judgment.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus although the public policy considerations may not win the day on
    the question of the existence of a duty of care they come back into play when the
    questions of the scope, standard and breach of the duty of care come to be considered. It
    seems to me that the effect of this decision is that cases where this duty will be held to
    have been reached will be very rare indeed. The Courts will not &quot;second guess&quot;
    operational decisions made by officers engaged in detecting and suppressing crime. In my
    view the test for breach will be similar to the &quot;Bolam&quot; test in clinical
    negligence cases : &quot;would a responsible body of police officers have so acted or
    omitted to act in these circumstances&quot; or perhaps the <i>Wednesbury </i>test :
    &quot;was the act or omission so unreasonable that no reasonable officer would have acted
    or failed to act in these circumstances.&quot; In practice they amount to the same test.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular it seems that where what is fundamentally challenged is a
    decision relating to the allocation of resources then Courts will be very unlikely to find
    a breach of duty.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But equally there is no room for complacency on the part of the police.
    Plainly a practice whereby confidential documents were left in vulnerable locations
    without good reason would be impossible to defend. Careless disclosure of the location of
    an observation post would again be hard to defend. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.5 Costello v The Chief Constable of Northumbria Police [1999] 1
    All ER 550.</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This case is fascinating, and it is a great pity that leave to
    appeal to the House of Lords was refused. An Inspector was found to have failed to go to
    the aid of a colleague engaged in searching a prisoner, when she had cried out in pain
    following an attack by the prisoner. I would imagine that considerable alarm must have
    been felt in all force solicitors offices up and down the country when this decision
    became known - indeed it is hard to imagine anything more calculated to undermine force
    morale than the prospect of police officers suing each other on the basis that they failed
    to help each other deal with violent detainees.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However I suggest that a careful reading of the decision demonstrates
    that this was a highly exceptional case, dependent largely on its own very special facts
    and that in practice it will again be very rare for a force to be held liable in these
    circumstances.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The critical finding of fact, described by Lord Justice May as leading
    to the &quot;quite startling result&quot; (553 g) was that the Inspector stood outside the
    cell for the express purpose of going to his colleague&#146;s assistance, and when that
    colleague cried out for help, he stood by and did nothing help, in breach of his
    self-admitted duty to go to her aid. Indeed I would suggest that this case is limited to
    those wholly exceptional facts, and in practice again successful cases in these
    circumstances will be very rare. However striking out such claims will be far harder than
    before. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arguments for immunity in these circumstances :</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A police officer shouldn&#146;t be under a positive duty to act where
    to do so would put himself at risk. Generally the law does not impose a positive duty to
    act to prevent harm by the deliberate wrong of third parties (<i>Smith v Littlewoods</i>).
    The Court should not place itself in a position where it will have to judge whether a
    police officer acted appropriately &quot;in the heat of the moment&quot;. Actions such as
    these should not be countenanced given the potential effect on force morale. Any alleged
    breach of duty should be determined in accordance with force disciplinary procedures.
    Other remedies were available to the Claimant. Such a duty would be far reaching and would
    apply to firemen, prison staff, rescue workers and others. It was significant, given the
    potential scope for such claims, that no such claim had ever previously been recognised in
    the courts. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arguments against immunity :</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Counsel analysed the Defendant&#146;s position in terms of an
    employer&#146;s duty to provide a safe system of work. He used the analogy of an officer
    carelessly failing to clean up an oil spillage. He relied on, inter alia, <i>Frost v The
    Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police </i>, in which the Chief Constable had conceded
    a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing his officers to unnecessary risk of
    physical or psychiatric harm. </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L.J. May indicated that the difficult decision for the court was
    whether, in this novel situation, it was fair, just and reasonable to impose the duty, or
    whether considerations of public policy required its rejection. Given the importance of
    the case, its potential scope and the fact that the public interest was expressly
    recognised as in the balance it is disappointing that the House of Lords refused leave to
    appeal. For what it is worth I think this case was wrongly decided and I set out below why
    I suggest that.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LJ May starts by citing Lord Keith in <i>Hill :</i></p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <i>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There is no question that a police officer, like anyone else, may

        and that <i>Knightley v Johns </i>... was regarded as rightly decided...&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest LJ May ought to have emphasised the word <i>&quot;direct&quot;</i>
    as opposed to <i>&quot;omissions&quot;</i>. No-one would suggest that the police cannot be
    liable for omissions which directly cause harm and this is well illustrated by the example
    of the failure to clear up an oil spillage given by the Claimants counsel. However in <i>Knightley
    </i>the motorist who collided with the on-coming police motorcyclist was held not to have
    been negligent, and therefore it is right to regard this as a case of the negligence of
    the Police Officer causing direct physical harm to his subordinate.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LJ May indicates that the case should be regarded as concerning an
    allegation of negligence against an officer in operational circumstances and thus
    distinguishes the case of <i>Walters v Commr of Police of the Metropolis</i>. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He observes when considering <i>Knightley </i>that :</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Two features of this decision are that the police
        inspector&#146;s own negligence had directly caused the Plaintiff&#146;s injury and the
        Plaintiff&#146;s injury was attributable in part at least to positive negligent
        intervention by the police inspector which created the danger [ie by giving the order to
        drive the wrong way down a tunnel]. The omission to close the tunnel was also held to be a
        breach of duty.&quot; </p>

    the Court of Appeal had observed that it was arguable that the Police had assumed a
    responsibility towards Mrs Swinney.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He then considered <i>Capital and Counties Plc</i>, summarising the
    same by saying that the rescue services should have immunity except where by their own

    indirect harm].</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At 563 f LJ May summarises the various strands of authority as follows
    :</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For public policy reasons the police are under no duty of care to
    members of the general public for their activities in the investigation or suppression of
    crime. Not a &quot;blanket&quot; immunity in that there may be exceptions where the police
    assume a responsibility to a particular individual, or other public policy considerations
    may outweigh those giving rise to the immunity. The police are not under a duty to respond
    to emergency calls, nor, if they do respond, are they liable for want of care in any
    attempt to prevent crime or effect a rescue unless their own negligent positive
    intervention directly causes harm which would otherwise not have occurred. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again for policy reasons a senior officer is not liable for operational
    decisions taken in the heat of the moment - but such an officer may be liable for positive
    negligent intervention which causes (directly) injury to the subordinate and for
    particular failure or particular instructions given in breach of specific regulations
    which result (directly) in injury. [I have added the words in brackets so as to fully set
    out what was decided in <i>Knightly].</i></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A police officer may assume a responsibility to another officer -
    this being the only increment to the decided cases. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far so good but then LJ May goes on to say this at 564 g :</p>

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If a police officer tries to protect a member of the public from
        attack but fails to prevent injury to the member of the public, there should in my view
        generally be no liability in tort on the police officer for public policy reasons... If a
        police officer tries to protect a fellow officer from attack but fails to prevent injury
        to the fellow officer, there should in my view generally be no liability in tort. The
        relationship between the two police officers is arguably closer than the relationship
        between the police officer and the member of the public, but the public policy
        considerations are essentially the same and are compelling. One such consideration is that
        in the circumstances liability should not turn on, and the Court should not have to
        inquire into, shades of personal judgment and courage in the heat of the potentially
        dangerous moment.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;But in this case, Inspector Bell acknowledged his police duty to
        help the plaintiff. Yet he did not, on the extraordinary facts found by the judge, even
        try to do so. In my judgment his acknowledged breach of police duty should also
        incrementally be seen as a legal breach of duty of care. The duty is to comply with a
        specific or acknowledged police duty where failure to do so will expose a fellow officer
        to unnecessary risk of injury. Although I have expressed the duty so formulated as in
        increment, it is the same as or very close to the duty which founded liability in <i>Knightly
        v Johns</i>. There is also a sense in which Inspector Bell assumed a responsibility, not
        absolute, for the plaintiff&#146;s safety. There is in my view in this case a strong
        public policy consideration to balance with those identified in <i>Hill&#146;s </i>case,
        that is the law should accord with common sense and public perception. I am sure Astill J
        was correct to say that the public would be greatly disturbed if the law held there was no
        duty of care in this case...&quot;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This shows that the case is very limited in scope - it only applies
    where an officer fails to do anything to help a colleague at a time when he acknowledges a
    specific duty to do so. I have already explained above why the fact that the individual
    officer acknowledges a &quot;duty&quot; to act should not be determinative of the issue
    whether a duty arises. I would also suggest that this result is anomalous in that it
    imposes liability for an omission to act in circumstances where liability for a careless
    positive act will not even be countenanced, which is the reverse of the normal position in
    negligence, see for example <i>Capital and Counties Plc</i>. As explained I suggest that
    LJ May&#146;s reliance on <i>Knightley</i> was ill-founded in that Knightley involved at
    least partly positive intervention and the infliction of direct physical harm, and even
    more importantly none of the public policy implications which - in relation to positive
    intervention by a rescuing officer - LJ May found to be &quot;compelling&quot; arose. In
    practice the decision means that the officer who is &quot;rooted to the spot&quot; in fear
    will be liable, but the officer who panics and intervenes carelessly will not. Would the
    public regard that distinction as a just one to make and would their concerns be allayed?</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hirst LJ (565 c) held that his &quot;considerable anxiety&quot; about
    the case was over-come by May LJ&#146;s judgment that <i>in the quite exceptional
    circumstances of this case</i> a duty of care did arise. He took the opportunity to
    emphasise that &quot;our decision in <i>Swinney</i> should not be interpreted in any shape
    or form as undermining the general principle laid down in <i>Hill&#146;s </i>case.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, although <i>Costello</i> must now be taken to represent the
    law, in practice it is likely to be confined to wholly exceptional circumstances and in
    some significant regards it is actually very restrictive of the scope of any duty of care
    owed by the police when going to the aid of the public and colleagues in that it supports
    the proposition that merely by going to the aid of a member of the public (and thereby
    arguably assuming a duty of responsibility towards that individual) a police officer does
    not take on a duty of care towards that individual. One example of this <i>might</i> arise
    in a public order situations - for example where the police deploy mounted officers at a
    football match to disperse hooligans so as to prevent injury to other spectators - if
    spectators injured as a result of the deployment - no duty of care would be owed to them. </p>

    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.6 Osman v The United Kingdom (ECHR).</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I confess at the outset that I do not find this an easy decision to
    follow at all since it seems to me to fail to take account our system of pleading and the
    basis upon which a claim is struck out by our Courts. It is again perhaps of significance
    that it is a claim which was highly &quot;attractive&quot;. The claimant&#146;s husband
    has been killed, her son shot and wounded by a mentally deranged individual fixated upon
    the son. The perpetrator had waged a bizarre campaign of harassment against the family
    over a considerable period of time and the allegation was, in essence, that the police had
    negligently failed to respond appropriately to clear evidence of a threat to the lives of
    members of the family. No doubt it can be seen as &quot;unjust&quot; and a denial for such
    a claim to never even be investigated by the Courts. No one called upon to consider the
    case could have anything but the utmost sympathy for the Osmans. The issue for the
    European Court however was whether their right to have their claim heard by the Courts of
    United Kingdom had been infringed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ECHR unanimously held that striking out this claim without a trial
    on the merits was a breach of Article 6 of the Convention in that it infringed the
    Osman&#146;s right of access to a court. However the Court expressly held that the
    exclusionary rule in <i>Hill&#146;s</i> case (which they did not limit to the
    &quot;proximity&quot; ratio) was acceptable in terms of the convention (as being necessary
    to maintain the effectiveness of the police force and hence prevent crime and disorder),
    but that its application to this case was disproportionate in that the exclusionary rule
    was not an absolute bar <i>where</i> competing public interests arose - eg the proximity
    test was satisfied and the allegation was that the police had been gravely negligent in
    protecting the life of a child and further there was the argument that the police had
    assumed a responsibility towards the applicants. Further the harm suffered was of a most
    serious nature and such considerations required an examination on the merits and not
    dismissal by way of application. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding of para 146 of the decision is that, whilst it may be
    permissible to exclude claims involving trivial consequences, this is not acceptable in a
    case where the result of the negligence was catastrophic. Whilst I can think of no
    comparable doctrine in UK law that, in itself, is not my difficulty with this decision.
    What I find hard to follow is the Court&#146;s failure to distinguish between the two
    ratios of <i>Hill </i>and to indicate when, if at all, the &quot;policy&quot; ratio can
    validly exclude a claim, notwithstanding the presence of a sufficient degree of proximity.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The suggestion that the fact that allegations of gross negligence on
    the part of the police and the failure to afford protection to a child raises conflicting
    issues of public policy which need to be weighed <i>following a trial on the merits</i>
    does seem to me to be particularly hard to sustain. Our system of pleadings requires a
    claimant to plead all relevant facts and matters relied on in support of the existence of
    a duty of care. In considering the application to strike out, the Court of Appeal in <i>Osman</i>
    were bound to assume in the Plaintiff&#146;s failure, (and did), that all allegations
    contained in the Statement of Claim were true and proved. How then could a trial on the
    merits advance the Osman&#146;s claim claim? The Court of Appeal had to (and did) address
    the issue whether in all the circumstances set out in the Statement of Claim it was fair
    just and reasonable to impose a duty of care, and in doing so weighed the relevant
    conflicting public interests. In those circumstances what purpose would a trial on the
    merits have served? What public interest considerations would emerge in a trial which
    would not be evident on the pleadings. It is significant that the conflicting public
    interests in <i>Swinney</i> were spelt out by the Court. None were identified in <i>Osman.</i></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nowhere does the ECHR indicate that <i>Hill</i> was wrongly
    decided, indeed the the Court expressly held that it was legitimate in terms of
    Convention. Yet that was a case where the alleged consequences of gross police negligence
    were catastrophic. It was of course a case where all the facts were not determined
    following a trial, but rather the weighing of conflicting public interests was carried out
    by the Judges assuming the allegation in the Statement of Claim to be true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hard to know what the practical effect of <i>Osman </i>will be.
    Clearly the courts will take even greater persuading that claims should be struck out.
    Where there is an arguable case that the Police assumed a responsibility to the claimant
    it seems to me that <i>Osman </i>is clear authority that such a claim must be tried.
    Indeed on one reading it is hard to see how any claim involving death or serious personal
    injury can be validly struck out if a procedure whereby every allegation a party choses to
    make is assumed to be true and proved is nonetheless to be regarded as unfair if that
    party is deprived of the opportunity of proving those facts. The Court&#146;s repeated
    emphasis on the fact that no Court proceedings (the perpetrator pleaded guilty at the
    Corwn Court and the Coroner&#146;s Inquest was purely formal) had established the facts
    means that <i>Osman </i>can be read as holding that it is a human right to bring a claim
    all the way to trial on the merits, notwithstanding that the claim is bound to fail, if no
    other fact finding procedure is available.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as the individual judgments are concerned having accepted the
    aim of <i>Hill&#146;s </i>case as legitimate Sir John Freeland&#146;s judgment included
    the following passages : </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The difficulty for me arises primarily from the fact that in the
        present case [<i>Hill&#146;s </i>case] appears to have been applied as if conferring on
        the police a blanket exemption from liability in negligence so far as concerns their
        function in the suppression of crime, to the exclusion of any examination by the court of
        considerations which might pull in another direction.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In this latter respect the present case stands in marked contrast
        to the later Court of Appeal case of <i>Swinney</i> where the Court had regard to the
        possible existence of other, and countervailing, considerations of public policy - in
        particular, as relevant in the circumstances of that case, the need to preserve the
        springs of information, to protect informers, and to encourage them to come forward. The
        court also considered it arguable, on the facts pleaded in that case, that there had been
        a voluntary assumption of responsibility by the police (a similar argument had been
        advanced by the applicants in this case)...&quot;</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the reasons given it does seem that in the light of Sir John
