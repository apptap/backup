<P>
<P>gives the following
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3 align=center>Judgment</H3>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>By decision of 19 July 1996, received at the Court 
  on 22 July 1996, the Industrial Tribunal, Southampton, referred to the Court 
  for a preliminary ruling under Article 177 of the EC Treaty six questions on 
  the interpretation of Article 119 of that Treaty, Council Directive 75/117/EEC 
  of 10 February 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States 
  relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women 
  (OJ 1975 L 45, p. 19), and Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on 
  the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as 
  regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working 
  conditions (OJ 1976 L 39, p. 40). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>Those questions were raised in proceedings between 
  Ms Grant and her employer South-West Trains Ltd (hereinafter 'SWT') concerning 
  the refusal by SWT of travel concessions for Ms Grant's female partner. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>Ms Grant is employed by SWT, a company which 
  operates railways in the Southampton region. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>Clause 18 of her contract of employment, entitled 
  'Travel facilities', states: 
  <P>
  <P>'You will be granted such free and reduced rate travel concessions as are 
  applicable to a member of your grade. Your spouse and depend[a]nts will also 
  be granted travel concessions. Travel concessions are granted at the 
  discretion of [the employer] and will be withdrawn in the event of their 
  misuse.'
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>At the material time, the regulations adopted by the 
  employer for the application of those provisions, the Staff Travel Facilities 
  Privilege Ticket Regulations, provided in Clause 8 ('Spouses') that: 
  <P>
  <P>'Privilege tickets are granted to a married member of staff ... for one 
  legal spouse but not for a spouse legally separated from the employee ...
  <P>
  <P>...
  <P>
  <P>Privilege tickets are granted for one common law opposite sex spouse of 
  staff ... subject to a statutory declaration being made that a meaningful 
  relationship has existed for a period of two years or more ...'.
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>The regulations also defined the conditions under 
  which travel concessions could be granted to current employees (Clauses 1 to 
  4), employees having provisionally or definitively ceased working (Clauses 5 
  to 7), surviving spouses of employees (Clause 9), children of employees 
  (Clauses 10 and 11) and dependent members of employees' families (Clause 12). 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>On the basis of those provisions Ms Grant applied on 
  9 January 1995 for travel concessions for her female partner, with whom she 
  declared she had had a 'meaningful relationship' for over two years. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>SWT refused to allow the benefit sought, on the 
  ground that for unmarried persons travel concessions could be granted only for 
  a partner of the opposite sex. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>Ms Grant thereupon made an application against SWT 
  to the Industrial Tribunal, Southampton, arguing that that refusal constituted 
  discrimination based on sex, contrary to the Equal Pay Act 1970, Article 119 
  of the Treaty and/or Directive 76/207. She submitted in particular that her 
  predecessor in the post, a man who had declared that he had had a meaningful 
  relationship with a woman for over two years, had enjoyed the benefit which 
  had been refused her. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>The Industrial Tribunal considered that the 
  problem facing it was whether refusal of the benefit at issue on the ground of 
  the employee's sexual orientation was 'discrimination based on sex' within the 
  meaning of Article 119 of the Treaty and the directives on equal treatment of 
  men and women. It observed that while some United Kingdom courts had held that 
  that was not the case, the judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-13/94 
  <I>P</I> v <I>S and Cornwall County Council</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C1394.html">[1996] ECR I-2143</a> was, on the 
  other hand, 'persuasive authority for the proposition that discrimination on 
  the ground of sexual orientation [was] unlawful'. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>For those reasons the Industrial Tribunal referred 
  the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: 
  <P>
  <P>'1. Is it (subject to (6) below) contrary to the principle of equal pay for 
  men and women established by Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the 
  European Community and by Article 1 of Council Directive 75/117 for an 
  employee to be refused travel concessions for an unmarried cohabiting same-sex 
  partner where such concessions are available for spouses or unmarried 
  opposite-sex cohabiting partners of such an employee? 
  <P>
  <P>2. For the purposes of Article 119 does "discrimination based on sex" 
  include discrimination based on the employee's sexual orientation? 
  <P>
  <P>3. For the purposes of Article 119, does "discrimination based on sex" 
  include discrimination based on the sex of that employee's partner? 
  <P>
  <P>4. If the answer to Question (1) is yes, does an employee, to whom such 
  concessions are refused, enjoy a directly enforceable Community right against 
  his employer? 
  <P>
  <P>5. Is such a refusal contrary to the provisions of Council Directive 
  76/207? 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P>6. Is it open to an employer to justify such refusal if he can show (a) 
  that the purpose of the concessions in question is to confer benefits on 
  married partners or partners in an equivalent position to married partners and 
  (b) that relationships between same-sex cohabiting partners have not 
  traditionally been, and are not generally, regarded by society as equivalent 
  to marriage; rather than on the basis of an economic or organisational reason 
  relating to the employment in question?' 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>In view of the close links between the questions, 
  they should be considered together. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>As a preliminary point, it should be observed that 
  the Court has already held that travel concessions granted by an employer to 
  former employees, their spouses or dependants, in respect of their employment 
  are pay within the meaning of Article 119 of the Treaty (see to that effect 
  Case 12/81 <I>Garland</I> v <I>British Rail Engineering</I> [1982] ECR 359, 
  paragraph 9). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>In the present case it is common ground that a 
  travel concession granted by an employer, on the basis of the contract of 
  employment, to the employee's spouse or the person of the opposite sex with 
  whom the employee has a stable relationship outside marriage falls within 
  Article 119 of the Treaty. Such a benefit is therefore not covered by 
  Directive 76/207, referred to in the national tribunal's Question 5 (see Case 
  C-342/93 <I>Gillespie and Others</I> v <I>Northern Health and Social Services 
  Board and Others</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C34293.html">[1996] ECR I-475</a>, paragraph 24). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>In view of the wording of the other questions and 
  the grounds of the decision making the reference, the essential point raised 
  by the national tribunal is whether an employer's refusal to grant travel 
  concessions to the person of the same sex with whom an employee has a stable 
  relationship constitutes discrimination prohibited by Article 119 of the 
  Treaty and Directive 75/117, where such concessions are granted to an 
  employee's spouse or the person of the opposite sex with whom an employee has 
  a stable relationship outside marriage. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>Ms Grant submits, first, that such a refusal 
  constitutes discrimination directly based on sex. She submits that her 
  employer's decision would have been different if the benefits in issue in the 
  main proceedings had been claimed by a man living with a woman, and not by a 
  woman living with a woman. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>Ms Grant argues that the mere fact that the male 
  worker who previously occupied her post had obtained travel concessions for 
  his female partner, without being married to her, is enough to identify direct 
  discrimination based on sex. In her submission, if a female worker does not 
  receive the same benefits as a male worker, all other things being equal, she 
  is the victim of discrimination based on sex (the 'but for' test). 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>Ms Grant contends, next, that such a refusal 
  constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation, which is included in 
  the concept of 'discrimination based on sex' in Article 119 of the Treaty. In 
  her opinion, differences in treatment based on sexual orientation originate in 
  prejudices regarding the sexual and emotional behaviour of persons of a 
  particular sex, and are in fact based on those persons' sex. She submits that 
  such an interpretation follows from the judgment in <I>P</I> v <I>S</I> and 
  corresponds both to the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the 
  Community institutions and to the development of international human rights 
  standards and national rules on equal treatment. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>Ms Grant claims, finally, that the refusal to 
  allow her the benefit is not objectively justified. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>SWT and the United Kingdom and French Governments 
  consider that the refusal of a benefit such as that in issue in the main 
  proceedings is not contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty. They submit, first, 
  that the judgment in <I>P</I> v <I>S</I>, which is limited to cases of gender 
  reassignment, does no more than treat discrimination based on a person's 
  change of sex as equivalent to discrimination based on a person's belonging to 
  a particular sex. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>They submit, next, that the difference in 
  treatment of which Ms Grant complains is based not on her sexual orientation 
  or preference but on the fact that she does not satisfy the conditions laid 
  down in the undertaking's regulations. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Finally, in their opinion, discrimination based on 
  sexual orientation is not 'discrimination based on sex' within the meaning of 
  Article 119 of the Treaty or Directive 75/117. They refer on this point in 
  particular to the wording and objectives of Article 119, the lack of consensus 
  among Member States as to whether stable relationships between persons of the 
  same sex may be regarded as equivalent to stable relationships between persons 
  of opposite sex, the fact that those relationships are not protected by 
  Articles 8 or 12 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
  Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950 (hereinafter 'the Convention'), and 
  the consequent absence of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 of 
  the Convention. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>The Commission likewise considers that the refusal 
  of the benefits to Ms Grant is not contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty or 
  Directive 75/117. In its opinion, discrimination based on the sexual 
  orientation of workers may be regarded as 'discrimination based on sex' for 
  the purposes of Article 119. It submits, however, that the discrimination of 
  which Ms Grant complains is based not on her sexual orientation but on the 
  fact that she is not living as a 'couple' or with a 'spouse', as those terms 
  are understood in the laws of most of the Member States, in Community law and 
  in the law of the Convention. It considers that in those circumstances the 
  difference of treatment applied by the regulations in force in the undertaking 
  in which Ms Grant works is not contrary to Article 119. 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>In the light of all the material in the case, the 
  first question to answer is whether a condition in the regulations of an 
  undertaking such as that in issue in the main proceedings constitutes 
  discrimination based directly on the sex of the worker. If it does not, the 
  next point to examine will be whether Community law requires that stable 
  relationships between two persons of the same sex should be regarded by all 
  employers as equivalent to marriages or stable relationships outside marriage 
  between two persons of opposite sex. Finally, it will have to be considered 
  whether discrimination based on sexual orientation constitutes discrimination 
  based on the sex of the worker. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>First, it should be observed that the regulations 
  of the undertaking in which Ms Grant works provide for travel concessions for 
  the worker, for the worker's 'spouse', that is, the person to whom he or she 
  is married and from whom he or she is not legally separated, or the person of 
  the opposite sex with whom he or she has had a 'meaningful' relationship for 
  at least two years, and for the children, dependent members of the family, and 
  surviving spouse of the worker. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>The refusal to allow Ms Grant the concessions is 
  based on the fact that she does not satisfy the conditions prescribed in those 
  regulations, more particularly on the fact that she does not live with a 
  'spouse' or a person of the opposite sex with whom she has had a 'meaningful' 
  relationship for at least two years. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>That condition, the effect of which is that the 
  worker must live in a stable relationship with a person of the opposite sex in 
  order to benefit from the travel concessions, is, like the other alternative 
  conditions prescribed in the undertaking's regulations, applied regardless of 
  the sex of the worker concerned. Thus travel concessions are refused to a male 
  worker if he is living with a person of the same sex, just as they are to a 
  female worker if she is living with a person of the same sex. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>Since the condition imposed by the undertaking's 
  regulations applies in the same way to female and male workers, it cannot be 
  regarded as constituting discrimination directly based on sex. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>Second, the Court must consider whether, with 
  respect to the application of a condition such as that in issue in the main 
  proceedings, persons who have a stable relationship with a partner of the same 
  sex are in the same situation as those who are married or have a stable 
  relationship outside marriage with a partner of the opposite sex. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>Ms Grant submits in particular that the laws of 
  the Member States, as well as those of the Community and other international 
  organisations, increasingly treat the two situations as equivalent. 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>While the European Parliament, as Ms Grant 
  observes, has indeed declared that it deplores all forms of discrimination 
  based on an individual's sexual orientation, it is nevertheless the case that 
  the Community has not as yet adopted rules providing for such equivalence. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>As for the laws of the Member States, while in 
  some of them cohabitation by two persons of the same sex is treated as 
  equivalent to marriage, although not completely, in most of them it is treated 
  as equivalent to a stable heterosexual relationship outside marriage only with 
  respect to a limited number of rights, or else is not recognised in any 
  particular way. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>The European Commission of Human Rights for its 
  part considers that despite the modern evolution of attitudes towards 
  homosexuality, stable homosexual relationships do not fall within the scope of 
  the right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention (see in 
  particular the decisions in application No 9369/81, <I>X. and Y.</I> v <I>the 
  United Kingdom</I>, 3 May 1983, <I>Decisions and Reports</I> 32, p. 220; 
  application No 11716/85, <I>S.</I> v <I>the United Kingdom</I>, 14 May 1986, 
  D.R. 47, p. 274, paragraph 2; and application No 15666/89, <I>Kerkhoven and 
  Hinke</I> v <I>the Netherlands</I>, 19 May 1992, <I></I>unpublished, paragraph 
  1), and that national provisions which, for the purpose of protecting the 
  family, accord more favourable treatment to married persons and persons of 
  opposite sex living together as man and wife than to persons of the same sex 
  in a stable relationship are not contrary to Article 14 of the Convention, 
  which prohibits <I>inter alia</I> discrimination on the ground of sex (see the 
  decisions in <I>S.</I> v <I>the United Kingdom</I>, paragraph 7; application 
  No 14753/89, <I>C. and L.M.</I> v <I>the United Kingdom</I>, 9 October 1989, 
  unpublished, paragraph 2; and application No 16106/90, <I>B.</I> v <I>the 
  United Kingdom</I>, 10 February 1990, D.R. 64, p. 278, paragraph 2). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>In another context, the European Court of Human 
  Rights has interpreted Article 12 of the Convention as applying only to the 
  traditional marriage between two persons of opposite biological sex (see the 
  <I>Rees</I> judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, p. 19, § 49, and 
  the <I>Cossey</I> judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 184, p. 17, § 
  43). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>It follows that, in the present state of the law 
  within the Community, stable relationships between two persons of the same sex 
  are not regarded as equivalent to marriages or stable relationships outside 
  marriage between persons of opposite sex. Consequently, an employer is not 
  required by Community law to treat the situation of a person who has a stable 
  relationship with a partner of the same sex as equivalent to that of a person 
  who is married to or has a stable relationship outside marriage with a partner 
  of the opposite sex. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>In those circumstances, it is for the legislature 
  alone to adopt, if appropriate, measures which may affect that position. 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>Finally, Ms Grant submits that it follows from 
  <I>P</I> v <I>S</I> that differences of treatment based on sexual orientation 
  are included in the 'discrimination based on sex' prohibited by Article 119 of 
  the Treaty. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>In <I>P</I> v <I>S</I> the Court was asked whether 
  a dismissal based on the change of sex of the worker concerned was to be 
  regarded as 'discrimination on grounds of sex' within the meaning of Directive 
  76/207. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>The national court was uncertain whether the scope 
  of that directive was wider than that of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, 
  which it had to apply and which in its view applied only to discrimination 
  based on the worker's belonging to one or other of the sexes. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>In their observations to the Court the United 
  Kingdom Government and the Commission submitted that the directive prohibited 
  only discrimination based on the fact that the worker concerned belonged to 
  one sex or the other, not discrimination based on the worker's gender 
  reassignment. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>In reply to that argument, the Court stated that 
  the provisions of the directive prohibiting discrimination between men and 
  women were simply the expression, in their limited field of application, of 
  the principle of equality, which is one of the fundamental principles of 
  Community law. It considered that that circumstance argued against a 
  restrictive interpretation of the scope of those provisions and in favour of 
  applying them to discrimination based on the worker's gender reassignment. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>The Court considered that such discrimination was 
  in fact based, essentially if not exclusively, on the sex of the person 
  concerned. That reasoning, which leads to the conclusion that such 
  discrimination is to be prohibited just as is discrimination based on the fact 
  that a person belongs to a particular sex, is limited to the case of a 
  worker's gender reassignment and does not therefore apply to differences of 
  treatment based on a person's sexual orientation. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>Ms Grant submits, however, that, like certain 
  provisions of national law or of international conventions, the Community 
  provisions on equal treatment of men and women should be interpreted as 
  covering discrimination based on sexual orientation. She refers in particular 
  to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 19 December 
  1966 (<I>United Nations Treaty Series</I>, Vol. 999, p. 171), in which, in the 
  view of the Human Rights Committee established under Article 28 of the 
  Covenant, the term 'sex' is to be taken as including sexual orientation 
  (communication No 488/1992, <I>Toonen</I> v <I>Australia</I>, views adopted on 
  31 March 1994, 50th session, point 8.7). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>The Covenant is one of the international 
  instruments relating to the protection of human rights of which the Court 
  takes account in applying the fundamental 
  <P>principles of Community law (see, for example, Case 374/87 <I>Orkem</I> v 
  <I>Commission</I> [1989] ECR 3283, paragraph 31, and Joined Cases C-297/88 and 
  C-197/89 <I>Dzodzi</I> v <I>Belgian State</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/R64221.html">[1990] ECR I-3763</a>, paragraph 
  68). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>However, although respect for the fundamental 
  rights which form an integral part of those general principles of law is a 
  condition of the legality of Community acts, those rights cannot in themselves 
  have the effect of extending the scope of the Treaty provisions beyond the 
  competences of the Community (see, <I>inter alia</I>, on the scope of Article 
  235 of the EC Treaty as regards respect for human rights, Opinion 2/94 [1996] 
  ECR I-1759, paragraphs 34 and 35). 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>Furthermore, in the communication referred to by 
  Ms Grant, the Human Rights Committee, which is not a judicial institution and 
  whose findings have no binding force in law, confined itself, as it stated 
  itself without giving specific reasons, to 'noting ... that in its view the 
  reference to "sex" in Articles 2, paragraph 1, and 26 is to be taken as 
  including sexual orientation'. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>Such an observation, which does not in any event 
  appear to reflect the interpretation so far generally accepted of the concept 
  of discrimination based on sex which appears in various international 
  instruments concerning the protection of fundamental rights, cannot in any 
  case constitute a basis for the Court to extend the scope of Article 119 of 
  the Treaty. That being so, the scope of that article, as of any provision of 
  Community law, is to be determined only by having regard to its wording and 
  purpose, its place in the scheme of the Treaty and its legal context. It 
  follows from the considerations set out above that Community law as it stands 
  at present does not cover discrimination based on sexual orientation, such as 
  that in issue in the main proceedings. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>It should be observed, however, that the Treaty of 
  Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the 
  European Communities and certain related acts, signed on 2 October 1997, 
  provides for the insertion in the EC Treaty of an Article 6a which, once the 
  Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force, will allow the Council under 
  certain conditions (a unanimous vote on a proposal from the Commission after 
  consulting the European Parliament) to take appropriate action to eliminate 
  various forms of discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual 
  orientation. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>Finally, in the light of the foregoing, there is 
  no need to consider Ms Grant's argument that a refusal such as that which she 
  encountered is not objectively justified. 
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>Accordingly, the answer to the national tribunal 
  must be that the refusal by an employer to allow travel concessions to the 
  person of the same sex with whom a worker has a stable relationship, where 
  such concessions are allowed to a worker's spouse or to the person of the 
  opposite sex with whom a worker has a stable 
  <P>relationship outside marriage, does not constitute discrimination 
  prohibited by Article 119 of the Treaty or Directive 75/117. 
  <P>
  <P>
  <P><B>Costs</B>
  <P>
  <P></A>
  <P></P>51. The costs incurred by the United Kingdom and French Governments and 
  by the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted 
  observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, 
  for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before 
  the national tribunal, the decision on costs is a matter for that tribunal. 
  <P>
  <P>On those grounds,
  <P>
  <P>
  <P>
  <P>
  <P align=center>THE COURT,</P>
  <P>
  <P>in answer to the questions referred to it by the Industrial Tribunal, 
  Southampton, by decision of 19 July 1996, hereby rules:
  <P>
  <P><B>The refusal by an employer to allow travel concessions to the person of 
  the same sex with whom a worker has a stable relationship, where such 
  concessions are allowed to a worker's spouse or to the person of the opposite 
  sex with whom a worker has a stable relationship outside marriage, does not 
  constitute discrimination prohibited by Article 119 of the EC Treaty or 
  Council Directive 75/117/EEC of 10 February 1975 on the approximation of the 
  laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of 
  equal pay for men and women.
