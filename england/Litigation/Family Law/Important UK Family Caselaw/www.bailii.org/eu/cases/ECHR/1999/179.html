  the case</B></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The facts of the case, as 
  submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 5 February 1993 a son was born 
  to the applicant and Ms X with whom he was not married. X and the child ceased 
  living with the applicant in March 1993. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">In September 1993 the applicant 
  made an application to the Brighton County Court under section 8 § 1 of the 
  Children Act 1989 for a residence order. In January 1994 the court made a 
  residence order in favour of X with a specific contact order in favour of the 
  applicant. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">In 1994 X married Mr B.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">In August 
  1995 the applicant made a second application for a residence order which he 
  subsequently withdrew. There were also a number of court hearings relating to 
  contact between the applicant and his son. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The applicant 
  claims that in April or May 1996 his parents received an anonymous letter to 
  which was attached a lengthy affidavit sworn by X in proceedings for a 
  non-molestation injunction and an ouster order she had instituted against B. 
  The affidavit set out, in detail, X’s complaints against B. These included 
  drunken behaviour and violence.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">On 3 June 
  1996 the applicant made a third application to the Brighton County Court 
  seeking a variation of the residence order of January 1994. The judge to whom 
  the case was assigned had previously made 11 orders in respect of the 
  applicant’s son.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 10 June 1996 the applicant, 
  referring inter alia to Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention, made a further 
  application asking for the residence application to be heard in open court 
  with public pronouncement of judgment. This would have enabled his family to 
  learn first hand whether his son was in danger.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The application of 10 June 1996 
  was dismissed at the directions hearing before a judge of the Brighton County 
  Court on 14 June 1996. The directions hearing was in chambers. The judge 
  ordered that the residence hearing should be also held in chambers and that 
  there should be no disclosure of documents relating to the case outside court. 
  The applicant claims that the judge warned him that publication of any 
  information obtained in the context of the proceedings would amount to 
  contempt of court.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The applicant 
  sought leave to appeal against this decision, but the County Court turned his 
  application down on 17&nbsp;June 1996. The applicant renewed his application 
  before the Court of Appeal. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western 
  style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The 
  Court of Appeal heard the application on 22 July 1996. It noted that under the 
  Family Proceedings Rules 1991 governing proceedings under the Children Act 
  1989 hearings were held in chambers although the court had a discretion to sit 
  in open court. The Court of Appeal recalled however its own judgment on 
  precisely this point in the case Re P B (A Minor), pronounced on 20 June 1996, 
  where it had been established that the courts were bound by the Family 
  Proceedings Rules to hear child cases generally in private. In the light of 
  the above decision, and also based on the finding that in the applicant's case 
  there was “nothing to distinguish the proceedings as out of the usual or 
  raising any issues which would justify a public hearing”, the Court of Appeal 
  dismissed the application by concluding that the judge at the Brighton County 
  Court had “exercised his discretion properly and judicially”. The Court of 
  Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Brighton County Court heard 
  the applicant's residence application in chambers on 23 July 1996. The judge 
  dismissed the application to vary the residence order. He also ordered under 
  section 91 § 14 of the Children Act 1989 that no further application for a 
  residence or contact order could be made by the applicant without leave of the 
  court. The judgment was pronounced in chambers. The parties were provided with 
  a copy in writing. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The applicant 
  applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal 
  refused leave to appeal against the order concerning residence but granted the 
  applicant leave to appeal against the order under section 91 § 14. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">On 17 
  November 1997 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the 
  order under section 91 § 14. It also made an order prohibiting the 
  identification of the child. The judgment was pronounced publicly.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 1 December 1998 the Court of 
  Appeal dismissed an application by the applicant to have the last order set 
  aside. This judgment was pronounced publicly as well. </P>

  Council v. W and Others (Disclosure) [1997] FLR 574).</P>
  <P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">3. In the Court of Appeal’s 
  judgment of 20 June 1996 on Re P B (A Minor), Butler-Sloss LJ noted that the 
  long-established practice in the English High Court and county courts hearing 
  applications for custody and access had always been to hear the whole of the 
  evidence in private. In the High Court, which heard the more difficult cases 
  and those which created public interest, judgment would often be given in 
  public either in part or in whole where the court believed that there was a 
  public interest in the case or that it should give guidance to the 
  practitioners. Appeals in the Court of Appeal were almost invariably heard in 
  public but oral evidence was almost never given and the proceedings were 
  conducted on the basis of documents and written and oral argument. It was the 
  Court of Appeal's practice to give a direction for non-identification of the 
  child. In the magistrates courts the public was not generally admitted to 
  family proceedings, but the press often were. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Butler-Sloss LJ also considered 
  that it was abundantly clear that the courts were bound by the Family 
  Proceedings Rules to hear child cases generally in private. Although the Rules 
  allowed for all or part of the case to be heard in public, in the light of 
  long-established practice it was unlikely that the judges would hear evidence 
  relating to the welfare of a child in public. The issues concerning the public 
  pronouncement of judgment were different and it might be that the practice of 
  giving judgment in private was partly due to the parties not asking for it to 
  be heard in public and partly because in the county court, where the vast 
  majority of children cases were heard, it was less likely that there would be 
  issues of public interest. Where issues of public interest did arise it would 
  seem entirely appropriate to give judgment in open court providing, where 
  desirable in the interest of the child, appropriate directions be given to 
  avoid identification. If the case raised issues of principle or of law, the 
  judgments were increasingly provided to the law reporters and were published 
  in the large number of law reports which reported family cases. However, the 
  majority of cases were of no interest to any one beyond the parties and their 
  families. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">According to Butler-Sloss LJ, the 
  practice of the English courts was not inconsistent with Article 6 § 1 of the 
  Convention which provided for exceptions in the interest of the child in both 
  the right to a public hearing and to a publicly pronounced judgment. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Peter Gibson LJ and Thorpe LJ 
  agreed in general with Butler-Sloss LJ. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">However, 
  Peter Gibson LJ considered the following in respect of the requirements of 
  Article 6 § 1 of the Convention: </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">“<FONT size=2>As for (the 
  applicant’s) reliance on Article 6 § 1 of the European Convention on Human 
  Rights, that Convention has not yet been incorporated into English law. 
  Further that Article itself recognises that the right to a pubic hearing is 
  qualified where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private 
  life of the parties so require. In agreement with Butler-Sloss LJ, I do not 
  regard the present practice as inconsistent with Article 6. It is a future 
  question whether judgment should be given in open court. Under English law it 
  need not be so given. But the court has power to give judgment publicly and in 
  exercising its discretion it can take into account the provision of Article 6 
  § 1 that judgment should be pronounced publicly, though, if so pronounced, it 
  should be done in such a way as to avoid detriment to the child.”</FONT></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">Thorpe LJ did not comment 
  on the Convention.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">4. Section 12 § 1 of the 
  Administration of Justice Act 1960 provides as follows:</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.27cm"><FONT

  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">According to 
  section 12 § 2 of the Act, the above do not apply to the publication of the 
  text or summary of the whole or part of the relevant court order.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Section 39 § 1 of the Children and 
  Young Persons Act 1933 gives the courts power to make an order prohibiting 
  publication, in a newspaper report or in a programme service, of specified 
  details or information calculated to lead to the identification of any child 
  concerned in the proceedings. This section only applies to proceedings in 
  which the child is the person by or against whom or in respect of whom the 
  proceedings are taken or if he or she is a witness in the proceedings.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The courts also have an inherent 
  jurisdiction to restrict or restrain the publication of information relating 
  to children involved in court proceedings concerning or connected with their 
  upbringing. The Court of Appeal in Re Z (A Minor) (Freedom of Publication) 
  [1996] 1&nbsp;FLR&nbsp;191 (per Ward LJ. at p. 208B/D) considered the 
  following in this connection: </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.25cm"><FONT 
  size=2>"(3) It follows that the ... inherent jurisdiction will be exercised 
  where the material to be published is directed at the child or is directed to 
  an aspect of the child's upbringing ... in circumstances where that publicity 
  is inimical to his welfare ...</FONT></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.25cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.25cm"><FONT

  to protect the integrity of its own proceedings. For example, by preserving 
  the anonymity of those who come forward to assist the court, so encouraging 
  full and free disclosure of all material facts impinging on the child's 
  well-being, the court serves the administration of justice, the ultimate end 
  of which is to do what is best for the child.”</FONT></P>

  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><B>PROCEDURE</B></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The application was introduced on 
  21 June 1996 and registered on 5 June 1997.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 2 July 1998 the European 
  Commission of Human Rights decided to communicate the application to the 
  respondent Government.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 23 September 1998 the 
  Government requested that examination of the case be adjourned pending the 
  outcome of application no. 35794/97 Michael J. Pelling v. the United 
  Kingdom.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 1 November 1998, by operation 
  of Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the case fell to be 
  examined by the Court in accordance with the provisions of that Protocol.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 2 February 1999 the Court 
  decided not to adjourn the examination of the case.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Government’s written 
  observations were submitted on 8 April 1999, after an extension of the 
  time-limit fixed for that purpose. The applicant replied on 30 June 1999, also 
  after an extension of the time-limit.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">On 28 April 1999 the Court granted 
  the applicant legal aid.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>

  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><B>THE LAW</B></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">1. The <SPAN lang="">applicant 
  complains</SPAN> under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that his case was not 
  heard in public and that judgment was not publicly pronounced.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P lang=en-US 
  style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm" 
  align=justify>Article 6 § 1 of the Convention provides as follows:</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.27cm">“<FONT 
  size=2>In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any 
  criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing 
  within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established 
  by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be 
  excluded from all or part of the hearing in the interests of morals, public 
  order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of 
  juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or 
  to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special 
  circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of 
  justice.”</FONT></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Government submit that the 
  applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies in respect of his complaint that 
  there was no public pronouncement of judgment. His application of 10 June 1996 
  was one of principle. As a result, on 23&nbsp;July 1996 he could have applied 
  again for the judgment to be given publicly.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The 
  Government also argue that there is no indication that the applicant did not 
  have a fair hearing. As a result, he cannot have sustained any actual 
  prejudice from the absence of a public hearing and a publicly pronounced 
  judgment. Accordingly, his application seeks merely a decision on an abstract 
  problem.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">Moreover, the 
  Government submit that there are amply sufficient reasons relating to the 
  interests of the child and the protection of the private lives of the parties 
  justifying the decision to have a private hearing in the case. Furthermore, 
  publicity would be prejudicial to the interests of justice. The practice of 
  the English courts to hear custody cases, as a matter of principle, in private 
  and the decision in the applicant’s case were well within the margin of 
  appreciation allowed to the domestic authorities. None of the participants in 
  the proceedings asserted that the applications for residence raised any point 
  of general public importance or that it was other than a run of the mill case. 
  The decision that the court was asked to make by the mother and the applicant 
  was with which of them should their child reside. This decision would 
  inevitably involve consideration of private and personal details. Children are 
  especially vulnerable to the glare of publicity, whether from the media, 
  campaigners or otherwise. Parties have the expectation that proceedings 
  concerning children will be heard in private. If the courts were to act 
  contrary to this expectation it would undermine confidence in the judicial 
  process.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">Finally, the 
  Government submit that the right to a publicly pronounced judgment, given its 
  link with the right to a fair hearing, must be subject to implied limitations. 
  The special features of the proceedings, which involved the custody of a 
  child, must be also taken into consideration. In any event, anyone who can 
  establish a legitimate interest may obtain a copy of the full text of a 
  judgment. Finally, the Government point out that two judgments following the 
  applicant’s application of 3 June 1996 have been publicly pronounced, namely 
  the Court of Appeal’s judgments of 17 November 1997 and of 1 December 
1998.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The applicant 
  submits that he has exhausted domestic remedies. The Government have not shown 
  that a further application for a publicly pronounced judgment would have had 
  any prospects of success given, in particular, the stance previously taken by 
  the County Court judge and the Court of Appeal. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The applicant 
  also submits that Article 6 requires that, in principle, court hearings should 
  be public. It is for the authorities to show that one of the exceptions in 
  Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applies to a particular case. Convention 
  provisions that allow for exceptions must be narrowly interpreted. Domestic 
  law seeks to reverse the burden of proof. Hearings in child custody cases are 
  in principle held in chambers and a litigant has to show a public interest or 
  point of law that would require a public hearing. This position is untenable 
  under the Convention. It is also inherently illogical since in Magistrates 
  Courts the press and at least some members of the public are present during 
  family hearings. </P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The applicant 
  points out that the Government fail completely to engage with the particular 
  circumstances of his case. As a matter of fact, vital pieces of the evidence 
  that were sought to be kept confidential were already in the public domain. 
  Moreover, the nature of some of this evidence was such that it became of 
  paramount importance that the whole picture become clear. Otherwise the 
  perception of the public would be that the court endorsed a residence 
  arrangement that placed the child at risk.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">Finally, the 
  applicant points out that, by pleading for implied limitations to the right to 
  a publicly pronounced judgment, the Government seek to reverse the Convention 
  organs’ case-law. The fact that Article 14 of the International Covenant on 
  Civil and Political Rights provides for an exception supports the applicant’s 
  position. The amendment to include this exception was proposed by the 
  Government of the United Kingdom in view of the fact that the procedure before 
  the domestic courts was shifting towards private hearings at the time.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">The Court 
  recalls that, although Article 35 § 1 of the Convention requires prospective 
  applicants to exhaust domestic remedies, this obligation does not extend to 
  the lodging of applications that have no prospects of success (the Padovani v. 
  Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-B, p. 19, § 19). The 
  Court notes in this connection that the applicant’s application for a public 
  hearing and for a publicly pronounced judgment was rejected by the County 
  Court judge on 14 June 1996. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision by 
  refusing the applicant leave to appeal. In these circumstances, the court 
  considers that an application for a publicly pronounced judgment lodged by the 
  applicant after the decision of the Court of Appeal would not have had any 
  prospects of success. It follows that the applicant has exhausted domestic 
  remedies in accordance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">In the light 
  of the parties’ remaining observations, the Court considers that this part of 
  the application raises serious questions of fact and law which are of such 
  complexity that their determination should depend on an examination on the 
  merits. It cannot, therefore, be considered manifestly ill-founded within the 
  meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention, and no other ground for declaring 
  it inadmissible has been established.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">2. The applicant also complains 
  under Article 10 of the Convention that he is not allowed to divulge 
  information concerning the proceedings.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1.27cm">Article 10 of 
  the Convention provides as follows:</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.27cm">“<FONT 
  size=2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This 
  right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart 
  information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless 
  of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the 
  licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.</FONT></P>
  <P class=western 
style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm; MARGIN-LEFT: 1.27cm"><FONT 
  size=2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it 
  duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, 
  restrictions or penalties as are</FONT> <FONT size=2>prescribed by law and are 
  necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, 
  territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or 
  crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the 
  reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information 
  received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of 
  the judiciary.”</FONT></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Government submit that the 
  interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression resulted directly from 
  section 12 § 1 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960. It was in accordance 
  with the law and served legitimate aims, the protection of the rights of the 
  child and the mother, and the maintenance of the authority of the judiciary. 
  It was also necessary in a democratic society. Allowing the applicant to 
  divulge information concerning the proceedings would have undermined the 
  protection given by Article 6 of the Convention. In any event, the 
  interference was within the domestic margin of appreciation.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The applicant accepts that the 
  interference was in accordance with section 12 of the Administration of 
  Justice Act and that it pursued a legitimate aim. However, it was not 
  necessary in a democratic society given that the most prejudicial evidence had 
  already entered the public domain. In any event, different less stringent 
  restrictions are imposed in Children Act proceedings in the Magistrates 
  Courts.</P>
  <P class=western style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><BR></P>
