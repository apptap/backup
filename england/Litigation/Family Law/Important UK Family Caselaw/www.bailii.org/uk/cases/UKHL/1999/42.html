  <LI value=1><A name=1>Throughout this century Parliament has provided 
  statutory protection for residential tenants and for certain persons with what 
  can be called derived rights from those tenants. The categories of those 
  persons have varied from time to time. Thus those persons were initially 
  successors in title (sections 1(3) and 2(1)(<I>d</I>) of the Increase of Rent 
  and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act 1915. By sections 5(1) and 
  12(1)(<I>f</I>)(<I>g</I>) of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest 
  (Restrictions) Act 1920 protection was extended to (a) the widow of a tenant 
  dying intestate who was residing with him at the date of his death and (b) 
  where a tenant dying intestate left no widow or was a woman, such member of 
  tenant's family residing with the tenant at death as might be decided in 
  default of agreement by a County Court. From 1933 it had to be shown that the 
  latter category (b) but not the former had filled a six months' residential 
  qualifying period (Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act 
  1933 section 13. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=2>By section 13 of the Rent Act 1965 rights of succession 
  were also given to the widow and members of the family of the first person 
  benefitting from the protection. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=3>The Rent Act 1977 consolidated the existing law but 
  section 76 of the Housing Act 1980 extended the rights to take over the 
  tenancy to a surviving spouse of either sex and not just to the widow. The Act 
  of 1977 was amended by the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>. 
  The result was that at the relevant time for the present case by Schedule 1 to 
  <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">the Act</A> of 
  1977 as amended an "original tenant" was defined as the person "Who, 
  immediately before his death, was a protected tenant of the dwelling-house or 
  the statutory tenant of it by virtue of his previous protected tenancy" 
  (paragraph 1). Then it is provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 that: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"2.&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;The surviving spouse (if any) of the original 
    tenant if residing in the dwelling-house immediately before the death of the 
    original tenant, shall after the death be the statutory tenant if and so 
    long as he or she occupies the dwelling-house as his or her residence. </UL>
  <P>
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;For the purposes of this paragraph, a person who 
    was living with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be 
    treated as the spouse of the original tenant. </UL>
  <P>
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;If, immediately after the death of the original 
    tenant, there is, by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) above, more than one person 
    who fulfils the conditions in sub-paragraph (1) above, such one of them as 
    may be decided by agreement or, in default of agreement, by the county court 
    shall be treated as the surviving spouse for the purposes of this paragraph. 
  </UL>
  <P>
  <UL>&nbsp;"3.&nbsp;Where paragraph 2 above does not apply, but a person who 
    was a member of the original tenant's family was residing with him in the 
    dwelling-house at the time of and for the period of two years immediately 
    before his death then, after his death, that person or if there is more than 
    one such person such one of them as may be decided by agreement, or in 
    default of agreement by the county court, shall be entitled to an assured 
    tenancy of the dwelling-house by succession." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=4>It is unnecessary for present purposes to set out the 
  remainder of the Schedule. It is however to be noted that since <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">the Act</A> of 1988 
  it is only the spouse (actual or deemed) who gets a statutory tenancy. Other 
  family members get an assured tenancy which does not pass on to that person's 
  successor whereas in the case of the spouse there may be a further succession. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=5>There are differences between this legislation and the 
  Housing Acts dealing with public sector housing but it does not seem to me 
  necessary to set out those provisions here. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=6>Mr. John Thompson was the "original tenant" of a flat 
  known as 75A Ravenscourt Road, London, W6 from 1972 until his death in his 60s 
  on 9 November 1994. That flat is part of a two-flat building of which the 
  respondents are the registered freehold owners. Mr. Martin Fitzpatrick, the 
  appellant in these proceedings, lived with Mr. Thompson in the flat from 1976 
  until the latter's death and has continued to live there since. It is agreed 
  between the parties that the appellant and the deceased had been partners in a 
  longstanding, close, loving and faithful, monogamous, homosexual relationship. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=7>The appellant sought a declaration that he had succeeded 
  to the tenancy under the Rent Act 1977, as amended. He claimed that he was "a 
  spouse" of the deceased in that he had been living with Mr. Thompson "as his 
  or her wife or husband" or alternatively that he was a member of Mr. 
  Thompson's family. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=8>His Honour Judge Colin Smith Q.C. in a sensitive and 
  sympathetic judgment found the relationship to have been of the description 
  agreed by the parties to which I have referred. He related an accident in 1986 
  when Mr. Thompson fell down the stairs and sustained a blood clot to the brain 
  which led to his being in a coma for some months. When he came round he never 
  spoke again. As the judge said "Eventually, after various unfortunate 
  incidents at the hospital, the applicant took Mr. Thompson home in April 1986 
  to care for him full time himself. The applicant took over the total care 24 
  hours a day for Mr. Thompson, feeding him and nursing him until his death in 
  1994. The applicant gave up his job and received benefit because he was unable 
  to work, due to his full time care of Mr. Thompson. Despite the loving and 
  dedicated care of the applicant, Mr. Thompson died in November 1994." </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=9>The learned judge held, however, that the appellant 
  could not succeed to the tenancy under either of the ways he put his claim. 
  Waite L.J. and Roche L.J. [1998] Ch. 304 agreed with him in the result though 
  expressing considerable sympathy and understanding of the position in which 
  same-sex partners living together found themselves under the legislation as 
  they, and in the case of Roche L.J. with hesitation in respect of the second 
  way of putting the claim, held it to be. They both considered that there were 
  matters which Parliament ought to consider. Ward L.J. in a trenchant and 
  detailed judgment concluded that the appellant succeeded as a spouse of, but, 
  if not, then as a member of the family of, the original tenant. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=10>On this appeal to your Lordships' House the appellant 
  put forward both grounds but he relies in the first place on paragraph 2 of 
  the Schedule to the Act of 1977, as amended. "Spouse" he says, is to be 
  interpreted in the present climate as including two persons of the same sex 
  intimately linked in a relationship which is not merely transient and which 
  has all the indicia of a marriage save that the parties cannot have children. 
  In the second place he says that the intimacy of the relationship of two 
  persons living together as he and Mr. Thompson were is such that they should 
  be regarded as constituting a family. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=11>It has been suggested that for your Lordships to 
  decide this appeal in favour of the appellant would be to usurp the function 
  of Parliament. It is trite that that is something the courts must not do. When 
  considering social issues in particular judges must not substitute their own 
  views to fill gaps. They must consider whether the new facts "fall within the 
  parliamentary intention" (<I>Royal College of Nursing v. D.H.S.S.</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html">[1981] AC 800</a></a>, 822 <I>per</I> Lord Wilberforce). Thus in the present context if, 
  for example, it was explicit or clear that Parliament intended the word 
  "family" to have a narrow meaning for all time, it would be a court's duty to 
  give effect to it whatever changes in social attitudes a court might think 
  ought to be reflected in the legislation. Similarly if it were explicit or 
  clear that the word must be given a very wide meaning so as to cover 
  relationships for which a court, conscious of the traditional views of society 
  might disapprove, the court's duty would be to give effect to it. It is, 
  however, for the court in the first place to interpret each phrase in its 
  statutory context. To do so is not to usurp Parliament's function; not to do 
  so would be to abdicate the judicial function. If Parliament takes the view 
  that the result is not what is wanted it will change the legislation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=12>The question is, therefore, was the appellant the 
  spouse of or a member of the family of Mr. Thompson within the meaning of this 
  Act? I stress "within the meaning of this Act" since it is all that your 
  Lordships are concerned with. In other statutes, in other contexts, the words 
  may have a wider or a narrower meaning than here. I refer to the judgment of 
  McHugh J. in <I>In Re Wakim</I> [1999] 173 A.L.J.R. 839, 850 in the High Court 
  of Australia which recognises that changes in attitudes and perceptions may 
  require a wider meaning to be given to a word such as "marriage", at any rate 
  in some contexts. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=13>The first question then is whether the appellant was 
  the "spouse" of Mr. Thompson within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 
  to the Act of 1977 as amended. I recognise that if the non-gender specific 
  noun "spouse" stood alone the matter might be more debateable as Mr. Blake 
  Q.C. contends, though the ordinary meaning is plainly "husband" or "wife". In 
  the context of this Act, however, "spouse" means in my view legally a husband 
  or wife. The 1988 Amendment extended the meaning to include as a "spouse" a 
  person living with the original tenant "as his or her wife or husband". This 
  was obviously intended to include persons not legally husband and wife who 
  lived as such without being married. That prima facie means a man and a woman, 
  and the man must show that the woman was living with him as "his" wife; the 
  woman that he was living with her as "her" husband. I do not think that 
  Parliament as recently as 1988 intended that these words should be read as 
  meaning "my same sex partner" rather than specifically "my husband" or "my 
  wife". If that had been the intention it would have been spelled out. The 
  words cannot in my view be read as the appellant contends. I thus agree as to 
  the result with the decision in <I>Harrogate Borough Council v. Simpson</I> 
  (1984) 17 H.L.R. 205. The appellant accordingly fails in the first way he puts 
  his appeal. Whether that result is discriminatory against same-sex couples in 
  the light of the fact that non-married different sex couples living together 
  are to be treated as spouses so as to allow one to succeed to the tenancy of 
  the other may have to be considered when the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/hra1998148/">Human Rights Act 
  1998</A> is in force. Whether the result is socially desirable in 1999 is a 
  matter for Parliament. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=14>Is it fatal to a claim to be a member of the family of 
  the original tenant that the appellant cannot show that he was living with Mr. 
  Thompson as his husband or wife, the nearest family relationship he asserts. 
  In my view it is not. If a person does not succeed on the first he may still 
  succeed on the second category. Here the partner fails because the first 
  category requires partners of different sexes. That he cannot satisfy. If he 
  satisfies the definition of family he may still qualify. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=15>I turn then to the second question which I at any rate 
  have found a difficult one--difficult largely because of preconceptions of a 
  family as being a married couple and, if they have children, their children; 
  difficult also because of the result in some of the earlier cases when 
  applying the law to the facts. It is, however, obvious that the word "family" 
  is used in a number of different senses, some wider, some narrower. "Do you 
  have any family?" usually means "do you have children?" "We're having a family 
  gathering" may include often distant relatives and even very close friends. 
  The "family of nations", "the Christian family" are very wide. This is no new 
  phenomenon. Roman Law, as I understand it, included in the familia all members 
  of the social unit though other rights might be limited to spouses or heirs. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=16>It is not an answer to the problem to assume (as I 
  accept may be correct) that if in 1920 people had been asked whether one 
  person was a member of another same-sex person's family the answer would have 
  been "no". That is not the right question. The first question is what were the 
  characteristics of a family in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/hra1998148/">the Act</A> of 1920 
  and the second whether two same-sex partners can satisfy those characteristics 
  so as today to fall within the word "family". An alternative question is 
  whether the word "family" in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/hra1998148/">the Act</A> of 1920 
  has to be updated so as to be capable of including persons who today would be 
  regarded as being of each other's family, whatever might have been said in 
  1920 (see Lord Steyn in <I>Reg. v. Ireland</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html"><A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html">[1998] AC 147</a></a></A></A> 
  at p. 158; <I>Bennion</I> "<I>Statutory Interpretation: a Code</I>" 3rd ed. 
  1997 at p. 686 and <I>Halsbury's Laws</I> (4th ed. Re-issue) (1995) vol. 
  44(1), para. 1473. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If "family" could only mean a legal 
  relationship (of blood or by legal ceremony of marriage or by legal adoption) 
  then the appellant must obviously fail. Over the years, however, the courts 
  have held that this is not so. </TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR><TD>
  <P>In the first place it has been said that the ordinary meaning of the word 
  is to be taken; "family" where it is used in the Rent Acts is not a term of 
  art (<I>per</I> Lord Diplock in <I>Carrega Properties S.A. v. Sharratt</I> 
  [1979] 1 W.L.R. 928, 931, though the meaning for Viscount Dilhorne (at p. 932) 
  is a question of law and "family" is not the same as "household". 
  <P>In the second place it has been accepted that de facto relationships can be 
  recognised as constituting a family. Thus in <I>Brock v. Wollams</I> [1949] 2 
  K.B. 388, a child adopted in fact who lived with the tenant for many years, 
  but who was not adopted under the Adoption of Children Act 1926, was held to 
  be a member of his family living with him at his death within the meaning of 
  the Act of 1920. Bucknill L.J., at p. 393, cited with apparent approval the 
  judgment of Wright J. in <I>Price v. Gould</I> (1930) 46 T.L.R. 411 where he 
  said in relation to wills and settlements that the legislature had used the 
  word "family" "to introduce a flexible and wide term" so that brothers and 
  sisters of the tenant were family for the purposes of the Act. Bucknill L.J. 
  had no doubt that both de facto adopted and illegitimate children were 
  included as family. Denning, L.J. added, at p. 396: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"It seems to me that 'members of the tenant's family' within 
    section 12 sub-section 1(g) of the Act of 1920, include not only legitimate 
    children but also step-children, illegitimate children and adopted children, 
    whether adopted in due form of law or not." </UL>
  <P>In <I>Ross v. Collins</I> [1964] 1 W.L.R. 425 the defendant had acted as 
  the original tenant's housekeeper in return for which he remitted her rent. 
  They had never addressed each other by their Christian names and there was no 
  question of an intimate personal relationship. Russell L.J., with whose speech 
  Lord Diplock in <I>Carrega</I> [1979] 1 W.L.R. 928, 931 agreed said, at p. 
  432: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Granted that 'family' is not limited to cases of a strict 
    legal familial nexus, I cannot agree that it extends to a case such as this. 
    It still requires, it seems to me, at least a broadly recognisable de facto 
    familial nexus. This may be capable of being found and recognised as such by 
    the ordinary man--where the link would be strictly familial had there been a 
    marriage, or where the link is through adoption of a minor, de jure or de 
    facto, or where the link is 'step-', or where the link is 'in-law' or by 
    marriage. But two strangers cannot, it seems to me, ever establish 
    artificially for the purposes of this section a familial nexus by acting as 
    brothers or as sisters, even if they call each other such and consider their 
    relationship to be tantamount to that. Nor, in my view, can an adult man and 
    woman who establish a platonic relationship establish a familial nexus by 
    acting as a devoted brother and sister or father and daughter would act, 
    even if they address each other as such and even if they refer to each other 
    as such and regard their association as tantamount to such. Nor, in my view, 
    would they indeed be recognised as familial links by the ordinary man." 
  </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=17>In the application of this "ordinary meaning", "de 
  facto" approach there are not surprisingly decisions on both sides of the 
  line. In <I>Helby v. Rafferty</I> [1979] 1 W.L.R. 13, the court refused to 
  hold that a man who had lived with a woman tenant for five years before her 
  death were part of the same family because they had deliberately opted to 
  retain their formal independence and they had not been recognised as being 
  married. In <I>Watson v. Lucas</I> [1980] 1 W.L.R. 1493, on the other hand, 
  the Court of Appeal by a majority held that a woman who had lived with a man, 
  although he remained married to his wife, was a member of his family for the 
  purpose of Schedule 1 to the Act of 1977 because of the lasting relationship 
  between them. In <I>Hawes v. Evenden</I> [1953] 1 W.L.R. 1169, the claimant 
  was an unmarried woman who had lived with the deceased tenant for 12 years and 
  had had two children with him. The court held that there was evidence that the 
  claimant and the tenant and the children had lived together as a family and 
  she was therefore a member of his family for the purposes of the Act of 1920. 
  In <I>Chios Property Investment Ltd. v. Lopez</I> (1987) 20 H.L.R. 120 the 
  court stressed the importance of a "sufficient state of permanence and

  not be a member of her family for the Act of 1920. Asquith L.J., at p. 331, 
  said that if their relationship was sexual "it seems to me anomalous that a 
  person can acquire a 'status of irremovability' by living or having lived in 
  sin, even if the liaison has not been a mere casual encounter but protracted

  (supra)</I> was wrongly decided and that it was absurd to distinguish between 
  two couples on the basis that one had children and the other did not. James 
  L.J. said, at p. 511: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The popular meaning given to the word 'family' is not fixed once 
    and for all time. I have no doubt that with the passage of years it has 
    changed. The cases reveal that it is not restricted to blood relationships 
    and those created by the marriage ceremony. It can include de facto as well 
    as de jure relationships. The popular meaning of 'family' in 1975 would, 
    according to the answer of the ordinary man, include the defendant as a 
    member of Mr. Wright's family. This is not to say that every mistress should 
    be so regarded. Relationships of a casual or intermittent character and 
    those bearing indications of impermanence would not come within the popular 
    concept of a family unit." </UL>
  <P>He accepted that <I>Gammans</I> was authority for the meaning of "family" 
  in 1949 but not in 1975. Bridge L.J. said, at pp. 512-513: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"Now, it is, I think, not putting it too high to say that between 
    1950 and 1975 there has been a complete revolution in society's attitude to 
    unmarried partnerships of the kind under consideration. Such unions are far 
    commoner than they used to be. The social stigma that once attached to them 
    has almost, if not entirely, disappeared. The inaccurate but expressive 
    phrases "common law wife" and "common law husband" have come into general 
    use to describe them. The ordinary man in 1975 would, in my opinion, 
    certainly say that the parties to such a union, provided it had the 
    appropriate degree of apparent permanence and stability, were members of a 
    single family whether they had children or not." </UL>

  your Lordships are not so bound. In that case it was held that two people, one

  the beginning of his speech, at p. 930: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The facts of the instant case, if they are not unique, are

    the original tenant's family' where at the time of the tenant's death there 
    did exist between him and the claimant to a statutory tenancy by succession 
    a relationship of one or other of the various kinds to which I have referred

  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=22>Given, on the basis of these earlier decisions that 
  the word is to be applied flexibly, and does not cover only legally binding 
  relationships, it is necessary to ask what are its characteristics in this 
  legislation and to answer that question to ask further what was Parliament's 
  purpose. It seems to me that the intention in 1920 was that not just the legal 
  wife but also the other members of the family unit occupying the property on 
  the death of the tenant with him should qualify for the succession. The former 
  did not need to prove a qualifying period; as a member of the tenant's family 
  a two-year residence had to be shown. If more than one person qualified then 
  if no agreement could be reached between them the court decided who should 
  succeed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=23>The hall marks of the relationship were essentially 
  that there should be a degree of mutual inter-dependence, of the sharing of 
  lives, of caring and love, of commitment and support. In respect of legal 
  relationships these are presumed, though evidently are not always present as 
  the family law and criminal courts know only too well. In de facto 
  relationships these are capable, if proved, of creating membership of the 
  tenant's family. If, as I consider, this was the purpose of the legislation, 
  the question is then who in 1994 or today (I draw no distinction between them) 
  are capable in law of being members of the tenant's family. It is not who 
  would have been so considered in 1920. In considering this question it is 
  necessary to have regard to changes in attitude. The point cannot have been 
  better put than it was by Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. in <I>Reg. v. Ministry of 
  Defence, Ex parte Smith</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/22.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/22.html">[1996] QB 517</a></a> at pp. 552-554 when, although 
  dealing with the validity of an administrative decision rather than the

  attitude in society towards same-sex relationships: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I regard the progressive development and refinement of 
    public and professional opinion at home and abroad, here very briefly 
    described, as an important feature of this case. A belief which represented 
    unquestioned orthodoxy in year X may have become questionable by year Y and 
    unsustainable by year Z. Public and professional opinion are a continuum."

    other cases where there is an emotional relationship between cohabitees. The 
    'tenderness' shown by the law to married women is not based on the marriage 
    ceremony but reflects the underlying risk of one cohabitee exploiting the 
    emotional involvement and trust of the other. Now that unmarried 
    cohabitation, whether heterosexual or homosexual, is widespread in our 
    society, the law should recognise this." </UL></A>

  There the issue was as to the meaning of the New York City Rent and Eviction 
  Regulations which provided that a landlord might not dispossess "either the 
  surviving spouse of the deceased tenant or some other member of the deceased's 
  tenant's family who has been living with the tenant." The majority of the New 
  York Court of Appeals held, at pp. 788-789: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The intended protection against sudden eviction should not rest 
    on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find 
    its foundation in the reality of family life. In the context of eviction, a 
    more realistic, and certainly equally valid, view of a family includes two 
    adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long term and characterised by 
    an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence." </UL>

  <UL>&nbsp;"The benefit is thus provided to a lasting living-together 
    partnership which displays a strongly tied up social relationship. It is

    do with sexual orientation. But this latter fact was both immaterial and

  On the other hand, the European Convention of Human Rights refers to family

  far accepted claims by same-sex partners to family rights. Leaving aside the

  <LI value=32><A name=32>It seems to be suggested that the result which I have 
  so far indicated would be cataclysmic. In relation to <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/hra1998148/">this Act</A> it is 
  plainly not so. The onus on one person claiming that he or she was a member of 
  the same-sex original tenant's family will involve that person establishing 
  rather than merely asserting the necessary indicia of the relationship. A 
  transient superficial relationship will not do even if it is intimate. Mere 
  cohabitation by friends as a matter of convenience will not do. There is, in 
  any event, a minimum residence qualification; the succession is limited to 
  that of the original tenant. Far from being cataclysmic it is, as both the 
  County Court judge and the Court of Appeal appear to recognise, and as I 
  consider, in accordance with contemporary notions of social justice. In other 
  statutes, in other contexts, the same meaning may or not be the right one. If 
  a narrower meaning is required, so be it. It seems also to be suggested that 
  such a result in this statute undermines the traditional (whether religious or 
  social) concept of marriage and the family. It does nothing of the sort. It 
  merely recognises that, for the purposes of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/hra1998148/">this Act</A>, two

  <P>
  <P>My Lords, </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=35>This appeal raises an important point on the 
  interpretation of a provision in the Rent Acts. For many years certain 
  residential tenants have enjoyed the benefits of fair rentals and protection 
  from eviction conferred by successive Rent Acts. Ever since the earliest days 
  of this legislation in 1920, these benefits have not been confined to the 
  original tenant. Under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest 
  (Restrictions) Act 1920, section 12(1)(g), 'tenant' included the widow of a 
  tenant in certain circumstances and, in other cases, such 'member of the 
  tenant's family' residing with him when he died as might be agreed or decided 
  by the court. In addition to protecting the tenant personally, Parliament has 
  always been concerned to protect the family unit of which the deceased tenant 
  was part. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=36>The language chosen for this purpose was the undefined 
  expression 'family'. This expression is not a term of art; that is, it is not 
  a technical term with a specific meaning. It is a word in ordinary usage, with 
  a flexible meaning. The statutory succession provisions have been amended 
  several times, but to this day family has remained unamended, undefined and 
  unparticularised. Parliament has left it to the courts to determine, in any 
  given case, whether a particular individual falls within the description. The 
  current legislative provisions are to be found in Schedule 1 of the Rent Act 
  1977, as amended by the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>. 
  The relevant phrase in paragraph 3 is 'a person who was a member of the 
  original tenant's family . . . residing with him in the dwelling-house at the 
  time of and for the period of 2 years immediately before his death'. There are 
  differences between the extent of the protection enjoyed by a surviving spouse 
  as a statutory tenant under paragraph 2 and the more limited protection now 
  accorded to a member of the original tenant's family as the holder of an 
  assured tenancy under paragraph 3. Nothing turns on this distinction for 
  present purposes. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=37><A name=37>Family is a word with several different meanings. In 
  some contexts family means children ('when shall we start a family?'). In 
  other contexts it means parents and children ('accommodation suitable for 
  families'). It may mean all persons connected, however remotely, by birth, 
  marriage or adoption ('family tree'). The present context is statutory 
  protection of the occupancy of a dwelling house that is a family home. On the 
  death of the tenant his family cannot be evicted without further ado. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=38>Herein lies the key to the meaning of family in this 
  context. The key is the statutory juxtaposition of membership of the tenant's 
  family and residence with the tenant. The legislation seeks to provide a 
  measure of protection for members of a family who are sharing their lives 
  together as a single family in one home. In this context children will readily 
  qualify. More remote blood relations of the tenant may also qualify if they 
  satisfy this 'sharing' criterion. For instance, a nephew or niece, the child 
  of a deceased brother or sister, might have come into the tenant's home at an 
  early age and become part of his family. Or a widowed or unmarried man might 
  live with his married brother and the brother's wife and children. Or an 
  unmarried brother and sister might have lived together throughout their lives. 
  Thus, in the early decision of <I>Price v. Gould</I> (1930) 143 L.T. 333 
  Wright J. decided that sisters and brothers living together qualified for 
  protection. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=39>This, then, is the first point to note. Although there 
  are hints of a different view in some of the cases, in the context of the 
  purpose of this legislation blood relations are not divided into fixed 
  categories, with near relations ranking as family and more distant relations 
  not. The closer the blood relationship, the easier it may be for the court to 
  identify the existence of the necessary family relationship or familial nexus, 
  as it is sometimes described. More remote kin are not excluded, although in 
  practice the more remote the kinship the less frequently will they be found 
  sharing their lives together as a family in one home. <I>Langdon v. Horton</I> 
  [1951] 1 K.B. 666 is an instance of this. First cousins, sharing a residence 
  for purposes of convenience, were held not to qualify. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=40><A name=40>The second point to note is that membership of a 
  family for this purpose is not confined to blood relations. The relationship 
  may be one of marriage. Indeed, the paradigm family unit was, and still is, a 
  husband and wife and their children. The wife, as well as the children, is a 
  member of the husband's family. Conversely, the husband and the children are 
  members of the wife's family. But children are not essential for the existence 
  of a family for the present purpose. The purpose of the legislation requires 
  that, even in the absence of children, a spouse may qualify. This accords with 
  one of the earliest decisions on these provisions. In 1925, before a widower 
  of the tenant was expressly mentioned in the legislation, Salter J. held that 
  the tenant's husband came within the statute: see <I>Salter v. Lask</I> [1925] 
  1 K.B. 584. This also accords with the provisions applicable when a lessor 
  seeks a possession order on the ground that alternative accommodation is 
  available for the tenant. Alternative accommodation must be reasonably 
  suitable for the needs of the tenant and his 'family': see the Rent Act 1977, 
  section 98(1)(a) and part IV of Schedule 15. It would be absurd if the 
  tenant's wife did not count as family for this purpose. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=41><A name=41>The next point to note is that family is not limited 
  to blood relations and the tenant's spouse. 'In-law' relationships may 
  qualify. 'Welcome to the family' is a customary greeting to the bride or groom 
  on the wedding of a son or daughter. A daughter-in-law, living with the 
  tenant, must be able to qualify as much as the son of the tenant to whom she 
  is married. A son-in-law may likewise qualify. In <I>Jones v. Whitehill</I> 
  [1950] 2 K.B. 204 a niece-in-law was held entitled to succeed. The Court of 
  Appeal expressly rejected the argument that family was confined to blood 
  relations. 'Step' relationships such as step-children may also qualify, as may 
  children who have been formally adopted. Parliament cannot intend that the 
  tenant's own child may qualify but a duly adopted child or a step-child may 
  not. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=42><A name=42>Having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the 
  width of the meaning borne by the expression family does not stop here. As one 
  might expect, the authorities have not drawn a rigid line at this point. A 
  child who is adopted in fact, although not in law, may be as much a member of 
  the tenant's family as a duly adopted child. The Court of Appeal so decided in 
  1949 in <I>Brock v. Wollams</I> [1949] 2 K.B. 388. More pertinent for present 
  purposes, a man and woman, unmarried but living together as husband and wife, 
  are capable of constituting family. In <I>Hawes v. Evenden</I> [1953] 1 W.L.R. 
  1169 the Court of Appeal upheld a decision of a county court judge that the 
  mistress of a man by whom she had had two children was a member of his family 
  for this purpose. The court held there was evidence justifying the judge's 
  finding that they had all lived together as a family. Somervell L.J., at page 
  1171, identified this as the key factor. Given that factual finding, the 
  court's conclusion must surely be right. A man and woman living together with 
  their children constitute a family for this purpose even though they are 
  unmarried. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=43>Three years earlier, in <I>Gammans v. Ekins</I> [1950] 
  2 K.B. 328, the Court of Appeal reached the contrary conclusion regarding a 
  childless couple. A quarter of a century later, in 1975, the Court of Appeal 
  had to consider again the position of an unmarried childless couple. In 
  <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd. v. Fox</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html">[1976] QB 503</a></a> a man and woman had lived 
  together as husband and wife for nearly 20 years. The court preferred the 
  approach adopted in <I>Hawes v. Evenden</I>. Expressing himself with his 
  customary simplicity and cogency, Lord Denning M.R. trenchantly criticised a 
  distinction based on the mere absence of children. He said, at page 509: 
  <UL>&nbsp;'That means this: if the couple had a baby 19 years ago which died 
    when a few days old, or as a young child, the woman would be a "member of 
    the tenant's family"; but if the baby had been still-born, or if the woman 
    had a miscarriage 19 years ago, she would not be a member of his family. Yet 
    for the last 19 years they had lived together as man and wife. That seems to 
    me a ridiculous distinction. So ridiculous, indeed, that it should be 
    rejected by this court: and that we should hold that a couple who live 
    together as man and wife for 20 years are members of the same family, 
    whether they have children or not.' </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=44><A name=44>In my view the approach adopted in the <I>Dyson</I> 
  case, as set out above, is unanswerably correct. The legislative purpose, of 
  protecting members of a family unit in their occupation of a house, requires 
  that a couple living together but without children should be as capable of 
  qualifying for protection as a couple living together with a child. The 
  <I>Dyson</I> approach has been followed in several reported cases and, no 
  doubt, numerous unreported decisions. All the reported cases rightly stress 
  the need for a permanent and stable relationship: see, for instance, <I>Helby 
  v. Rafferty</I> [1979] 1 W.L.R. 13, <I>Watson v. Lucas</I> [1980] 1 W.L.R. 
  1493 and <I>Chios Property Investment Co. Ltd. v. Lopez</I> (1987) 20 H.L.R. 
  120. Since then Parliament has made express provision, by the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>, 
  for this type of case. The surviving spouse of the original tenant, if living 
  in the house at the tenant's death, becomes the statutory tenant. For this 
  purpose 'a person who was living with the original tenant as his or her wife 
  or husband shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant': see 
  paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 1 to the Rent Act 1977, as inserted by the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>, 
  <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/s39.html">section 
  39</A>(2) and paragraph 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 4. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=45>I interpose that, in agreement with all your 
  Lordships, I do not accept that the appellant falls within the extended 
  meaning given to spouse by paragraph 2(2). The surviving spouse of the 
  original tenant was the person to whom the original tenant was married when he 
  or she died. Paragraph 2(2) extends this to include persons who conducted 
  themselves as husband and wife although they were not married. Marriage, 
  spouse, husband and wife are all terms connoting a relationship between a man 
  and a woman, that is, between two persons of opposite sex. A husband is a man 
  and a wife is a woman. These are, in this context, gender-specific words. This 
  approach accords with the view of the Court of Appeal in <I>Harrogate Borough 
  Council v. Simpson</I> (1984) 17 H.L.R. 205. The court was considering a 
  phrase in section 30 of the Housing Act 1980 that is different in detail but 
  substantially to the same effect ('. . . if they live together as husband and 
  wife'). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=46>This is the background against which a decision has to 
  be made in the present case. The above discussion shows that the courts have 
  given a wide and elastic meaning to family in the present context. Rightly so, 
  because the legislation would fail to cover the whole of the target intended 
  to be protected if family were given a narrow or rigid meaning. Such a meaning 
  would fail to reflect the diverse ways people, in a multi-cultural society, 
  now live together in family units. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=47>The question calling for decision in the present case 
  is a question of statutory interpretation. It is whether a same sex partner is 
  capable of being a member of the other partner's family for the purposes of 
  the Rent Act legislation. I am in no doubt that this question should be 
  answered affirmatively. A man and woman living together in a stable and 
  permanent sexual relationship are capable of being members of a family for 
  this purpose. Once this is accepted, there can be no rational or other basis 
  on which the like conclusion can be withheld from a similarly stable and 
  permanent sexual relationship between two men or between two women. Where a 
  relationship of this character exists, it cannot make sense to say that, 
  although a heterosexual partnership can give rise to membership of a family 
  for Rent Act purposes, a homosexual partnership cannot. Where sexual partners 
  are involved, whether heterosexual or homosexual, there is scope for the 
  intimate mutual love and affection and long-term commitment that typically 
  characterise the relationship of husband and wife. This love and affection and 
  commitment can exist in same sex relationships as in heterosexual 
  relationships. In sexual terms a homosexual relationship is different from a 
  heterosexual relationship, but I am unable to see that the difference is 
  material for present purposes. As already emphasised, the concept underlying 
  membership of a family for present purposes is the sharing of lives together 
  in a single family unit living in one house. </A>

  <LI value=48><A name=48>A similar conclusion was reached in 1989 by the New 
  York Court of Appeals in its majority decision in <I>Braschi v. Stahl 
  Associates Co.</I> 544 N.Y.S. 2d 784 (Ct. App. 1989). The New York 
  non-eviction legislation was expressed in terms substantially the same as the 
  Rent Act legislation of this country. </TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

  <LI value=49><A name=49>I must refer to one further authority: the decision of 
  this House in <I>Carega Properties S.A. v. Sharratt</I> [1979] 1 W.L.R. 928. 
  This was the only occasion on which your Lordships have previously considered 
  the meaning of family in the Rent Act legislation. A widow aged 75 developed a 
  platonic relationship with a young man aged 24. He lived in her flat for 
  nearly 20 years until she died. They treated themselves as aunt and nephew. 
  The trial judge held that through their relationship this elderly lady and 
  young man achieved a familial nexus, meaning thereby a nexus such as one would 
  only find within a family. The Court of Appeal reversed the judge's decision, 
  and held that on the facts the relationship was not within the permissible 
  limits of the meaning of the phrase 'a member of the . . . tenant's family'. 
  This House upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. Lord Diplock delivered 
  the leading speech. He agreed with observations of Russell L.J., in <I>Ross v. 
  Collins</I> [1964] 1 W.L.R. 425, 432, to the effect that an adult man and 
  woman who establish a platonic relationship cannot establish a family nexus by 
  acting as a devoted brother and sister or father and daughter would act. This 
  is so, even if they address each other as such and even if they refer to each 
  other as such and regard their association as tantamount to such. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=50>On this appeal your Lordships have not been invited to 
  depart from your Lordships' decision in the <I>Carega</I> case. This does not 
  preclude your Lordships from deciding this appeal to the effect I have already 
  indicated. Had it done so, I would have wished to consider afresh the decision 
  in that case. The reason why the decision in <I>Carega</I> is not an 
  impediment is this. In <I>Carega</I> Lord Diplock, at page 930, stated that 
  the facts of the case did not provide a suitable occasion for the House to 
  undertake a general consideration of what persons may be included in the 
  expression 'a member of the . . . tenant's family'. Further, he disavowed any 
  intention to review the decision in the <I>Dyson </I>case, stating that this 
  was best left for consideration in the light of the actual facts of a case in 
  which it arises. The present case, like <I>Dyson</I>, but unlike 
  <I>Carega</I>, is a sexual partnership case. I do not understand the House in 
  <I>Carega </I>to have been expressing any views regarding this type of case. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=51><A name=51>I must also mention the 'ordinary person' test 
  enunciated by Cohen L.J. in <I>Brock v. Wollams</I> [1942] 2 K.B. 388, 395. He 
  suggested that the trial judge should ask himself this question: would an 
  ordinary person, addressing his mind to the question whether the defendant was 
  a member of the family, have answered 'yes' or 'no'? This oft-quoted test has 
  tended to bedevil this area of the law. It may be useful as a reminder that 
  family is not a term of art. But the test gives uncertain guidance when, as 
  here, the members of the Court of Appeal and also your Lordships are divided 
  on how the question should be answered. Contrary to what seems implicit in 
  this form of question, the expression family does not have a single, readily 
  recognisable meaning. As I have emphasised, the meaning of family depends upon 
  the context in which it is being used. The suggested question does not assist 
  in identifying the essential ingredients of the concept of family in the 
  present context. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=52><A name=52>In the course of a well-reasoned and attractively 
  presented argument, Mr. Chapman submitted that homosexual relationships have 
  always existed and that at the inception of the Rent Act regime in the 1920s a 
  homosexual partner would not have been regarded as a member of the tenant's 
  family. In those days homosexual acts between men constituted a criminal 
  offence. This remained so until they were de-criminalised by the Sexual 
  Offences Act 1967. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=53><A name=53>This submission raises the question whether the word 
  family as used in the Rent Acts may change its meaning as ways of life and 
  social attitudes change. Can the expression family legitimately be interpreted 
  in 1999 as having a different and wider meaning than when it was first enacted 
  in 1920? The principles applicable were stated cogently by Lord Wilberforce in 
  <I>Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom v. Department of Health and 
  Social Security</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html">[1981] AC 800</a></a>, 822. A statute must necessarily be 
  interpreted having regard to the state of affairs existing when it was 
  enacted. It is a fair presumption that Parliament's intention was directed at 
  that state of affairs. When circumstances change, a court has to consider 
  whether they fall within the parliamentary intention. They may do so if there 
  can be detected a clear purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled 
  if an extension is made. How liberally these principles may be applied must 
  depend upon the nature of the enactment, and the strictness or otherwise of 
  the words in which it was expressed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=54>In the present case Parliament used an ordinary word 
  of flexible meaning and left it undefined. The underlying legislative purpose 
  was to provide a secure home for those who share their lives together with the 
  original tenant in the manner which characterises a family unit. This purpose 
  would be at risk of being stultified if the courts could not have regard to 
  changes in the way people live together and changes in the perception of 
  relationships. This approach is supported by the fact that successive Rent 
  Acts have used the same undefined expression despite the far-reaching changes 
  in ways of life and social attitudes meanwhile. It would be unattractive, to 
  the extent of being unacceptable, to interpret the word family in the Rent Act 
  1977 without regard to these changes. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=55><A name=55>The change in attitudes towards unmarried couples 
  cohabiting as husband and wife exemplifies this point. In <I>Gammans v. 
  Ekins</I> [1950] 2 K.B. 328 the court's decision was affected by its 
  perception of the immorality of such a relationship. An immoral relationship 
  did not come within the ambit of family in the Rent Acts. Asquith L.J., at 
  page 331, said it would be anomalous that a person could acquire protection by 
  living in sin even if the liaison was protracted in time and conclusive in 
  character. Jenkins L.J., at page 332, described the relationship as no more 
  than a liaison between two elderly people who chose to pose as husband and 
  wife when they in fact were not. Evershed M.R., at page 334, was more 
  hesitant, but his conclusion was that it might be no bad thing to show that 
  one of the privileges derivable from marriage was not equally enjoyed by those 
  living together as man and wife but in fact unmarried. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=56>In one respect of crucial importance there has been a 
  change in social attitudes over the last half-century. I am not referring to 
  the change in attitude toward sexual relationships between a man and woman 
  outside marriage or toward homosexual relationships. There has been a 
  widespread change in attitude toward such relationships, although differing 
  and deeply felt views are held on these matters. These differing views are to 
  be recognised and respected. The crucial change to which I am referring is 
  related but different. It is that the morality of a lawful relationship is not 
  now regarded as relevant when the court is deciding whether an individual 
  qualifies for protection under the Rent Acts. Parliament itself made this 
  clear in 1988, when amending the Rent Acts in the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>. 
  Paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 1 envisages that more than one person may be living 
  with the tenant as a surviving spouse under the extended definition. In so 
  enacting the law Parliament was not expressing a view, either way, on the 
  morality of such relationships. But by this provision Parliament made plain 
  that, for purposes of Rent Act protection, what matters is the factual 
  position. The same must be true of homosexual relationships. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=57>It is for this reason that I do not accept the 
  argument that the inclusion of a tenant's homosexual partner within the ranks 
  of persons eligible to qualify as members of his family is a step which should 
  be left to Parliament. It really goes without saying that in cases such as 
  this the courts must always proceed with particular caution and sensitivity. 
  That is not to say the courts can never proceed at all. That is not what the 
  Court of Appeal did in 1975 when deciding the <I>Dyson</I> case. Nor should 
  this course commend itself to your Lordships in the present case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=58>In this regard, at the risk of repetition, it is 
  necessary to stress the limited nature of the decision in this case. The 
  courts have already decided that the undefined expression 'family' is to be 
  given a wide meaning in the context of the Rent Acts. The courts have already 
  decided that family includes relationships other than those based on 
  consanguinity or affinity. To include same sex partners is to do no more than 
  apply to them the same rationale as that underlying the inclusion of different 
  sex partners. The decision goes no further than this. The decision leaves 
  untouched questions such as whether persons of the same sex should be able to 
  marry, and whether a stable homosexual relationship is within the scope of the 
  right to respect for family life in article 8 of the European Convention on 
  Human Rights. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=59><A name=59>I would allow this appeal. It is not disputed that if 
  a same sex partner can qualify as a member of the tenant's family, the 
  appellant does in fact qualify. He and the original tenant, until the latter's 
  death, lived together for many years in a stable homosexual relationship. The 
  judge found they enjoyed a very close, loving and monogamous homosexual 
  relationship. In my view the appellant falls within paragraph 3. 
  <P>
  <P><B>LORD CLYDE</B> 
  <P>
  <P>My Lords, </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=60><A name=60>The late John Thomson was the statutory or protected 
  tenant of a flat owned by the respondents from 1972 until his death in 1994. 
  Since 1976 the appellant had lived in the flat with him in what is described 
  in the agreed facts as a long-standing, close, loving and faithful monogamous 
  homosexual relationship. The appellant claims to be entitled to succeed to the 
  tenancy on the death of his partner as a statutory tenant by succession under 
  the Rent Act 1977. For this purpose he has to bring himself within the 
  provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to that Act which sets out the provisions 
  for determining who is the statutory tenant by succession after the death of a 
  protected or statutory tenant. The appellant founds on two particular 
  provisions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=61><A name=61>The first of these is contained in paragraph 2(2) of 
  the Schedule which was added by section 39 and Schedule 4 of the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>. 
  Prior to that addition the paragraph referred only to a spouse of the original 
  tenant. It has not been suggested that the appellant could qualify as a 
  spouse. Sub-paragraph (2) extended the scope of the paragraph by stating: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, a person who was living 
    with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be treated as 
    the spouse of the original tenant." </UL>
  <P>It is on this extension of the scope of the provision relating to spouses 
  that the appellant bases the first branch of his argument. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=62><A name=62>I am not persuaded that the appellant qualifies under 
  this provision. The language here plainly indicates a biological distinction 
  between the sex of the original tenant and that of the successor. The careful 
  use of the words "his" and "her" and the phrase "wife or husband" point to a 
  heterosexual relationship. I see no difference between the language used and 
  the phrase "his wife or her husband" and I cannot read the language as if it 
  had said "his or her partner." Taking the words in their ordinary sense, the 
  sub-paragraph does not in my view include a homosexual relationship. That was 
  the view taken by the Court of Appeal in <I>Harrogate Borough Council v. 
  Simpson</I> (1984) 17 H.L.R. 205 and I consider that that decision was 
  correct. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=63><A name=63>The alternative view which was adopted by Ward L.J. in 
  the present case involves a construction of the word "as" which fastens too 
  narrowly on a consideration of the manner of the cohabitation and ignores 
  considerations of form, appearance and capacity. Even if the word "as" does 
  not require a complete equation, nevertheless the approximation must be a 
  closer one than can exist in the case of a homosexual couple. The essential 
  characteristic of the relationship of husband and wife is the bond of 
  marriage. The paragraph in my view is simply seeking to cover situations where 
  the couple are husband and wife in every respect except that they are not 
  married. Thus merely living in the same household will not be sufficient; the 
  manner of their living together and the reason for their so doing may also 
  have to be explored (<I>Crake v. Supplementary Benefits Commission</I> [1982] 
  1 All E.R. 498). I would only add that the view which I take of this head of 
  the argument appears to accord with <I>El-Al Israeli Airlines Ltd. v. 
  Danilowitz</I> [1994] Case 712/94, where the respondent before the Supreme 
  Court of Israel did not attempt to challenge the view taken by the State 
  Tribunal that a homosexual partner did not qualify as a "spouse (husband or 
  wife)" nor as "a cohabitant publicly known as his/her wife/husband." That 
  case, like that of <I>Egan v. Canada</I> (1995) 124 D.L.R. (4th) 609, where 
  the relevant statute defined "spouse" as including a person of the opposite 
  sex, was concerned primarily with a question of discrimination; but that 
  question is not directly raised in the present appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=64><A name=64>The appellant then turns to paragraph 3 of the 
  Schedule. The relevant part of that paragraph in its amended version reads: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"(3) Where paragraph 2 above does not apply, but a person who was 
    a member of the original tenant's family was residing with him in the 
    dwelling-house at the time of and for a period of two years immediately 
    before his death then, after his death, that person . . . shall be entitled 
    to an assured tenancy of the dwelling-house by succession." </UL>
  <P>The appellant meets the requirement of residence at the time of the death 
  and for the two years immediately prior thereto. So the question comes to be, 
  was the appellant a "member of the original tenant's family?" </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=65><A name=65>The word "family" connotes essentially some grouping, 
  usually of persons, who are connected with each other by some particular kind 
  of bond. But the precise content of the group depends upon the context in 
  which the term is used. In some contexts it may require to be restricted to 
  members who are linked by ties of consanguinity or affinity or both 
  consanguinity and affinity. A family so linked may be said to exist even 
  although they do not live together or even meet each other. On a narrower view 
  the context may in some cases even require the group to consist only of 
  children. On the other hand the tie may in particular circumstances consist of 
  a close and intimate degree of companionship between people who are living 
  together in one dwelling even if no relationship of blood or marriage exists 
  between them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=66><A name=66>The word "family" in the context of the rent 
  legislation can be traced to section 12(1)(<I>g</I>) of the Increase of Rent 
  and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920. The meaning of the word 
  "family" in the context of the Rent Acts was explored long ago by Wright J. in 
  <I>Price v. Gould</I> (1930) 46 T.L.R. 411 where it was recognised that the 
  word was a "popular, loose and flexible expression, and not a technical term." 
  In <I>Stewart v. Mackay</I>, 1947 S.C. 287</REF> in relation to the phrase 
  "the needs of the tenant and his family" it was considered that domestic 
  servants and even lodgers might fall within the description if they had a 
  sufficient degree of permanence and the general relationship. In <I>Brock v. 
  Wollams</I> [1949] 2 K.B. 388 the narrow meaning of relations by blood or 
  marriage was rejected, so also was the idea that "family" could be equated 
  with "household." A bond which goes no further than the fact that the group 
  are living under the same roof is not enough. The preferred meaning was that 
  formulated by the "Cohen question" which was repeated by its author as a fair 
  test in <I>Standingford v. Probert</I> [1950] 1 K.B. 377, 383. The test 
  involves the artificiality of an imaginary recourse to a hypothetical 
  representative of the general public; in substance it requires the application 
  of the ordinary popular sense of the word. Once the test is established, the 
  problem seems to me to be one of the application of the word rather than its 
  construction. But, as was pointed out in <I>Sefton Holdings Ltd. v. Cairns</I> 
  (1987) 20 H.L.R. 124, the question is whether the person was a member of the 
  family, not whether he was living as a member of the family. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=67><A name=67>Some of the most close family relationships may be 
  created by choice, between persons who may otherwise have been strangers to 
  each other. Marriage is the obvious example. Adoption of children is another. 
  The element of a free mutual choice of a close intimate relationship and the 
  voluntary determination to spend one's life with another is one form of a 
  family bond. The kind of relationship with which the present case is concerned 
  is one where the parties of their own choice live together in a situation of 
  actual or potential sexual intimacy. Beyond that kind of case and the case of 
  a relationship akin to that of parent and child the element of choice does not 
  seem to operate to achieve a family bond. One cannot choose to become a 
  brother or a sister, an aunt or an uncle. Some may choose to be a family 
  member. Others have it thrust upon them. </TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR> 
  <TR><TD></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=68><A name=68>It can be seen from the decided cases that the concept 
  of "family" developed over time so as to extend to unmarried heterosexual 
  couples. In <I>Gammans v. Ekins</I> [1950] 2 K.B. 328 the Court of Appeal 
  firmly rejected the proposition that a man who had lived for twenty years with 
  a female tenant, "masquerading" as Asquith L.J. put it, as husband and wife, 
  was a member of the tenant's family. On the other hand where the couple had 
  had children and they all lived in the house together it was held that the 
  mother was a member of the father's family (<I>Hawes v. Evenden</I> [1953] 1 
  W.L.R. 1169). A quarter of a century after the <I>Gammans</I> case, in 
  <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd. v. Fox</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html">[1976] QB 503</a></a>, it was held that in the 
  changed social conditions then prevailing the unmarried female partner of a 
  male tenant who had lived with him for twenty-one years was a member of the 
  tenant's family, even although there were no children of their association. 
  Indeed the same result was reached in <I>Watson v. Lucas</I> [1980] 1 W.L.R. 
  1493 where the parties could not have been legally married to each other 
  because the male partner was already married. On the other hand in <I>Helby v. 
  Rafferty</I> [1979] 1 W.L.R. 13 the relationship between a heterosexual couple 
  who had lived together was held to lack the permanence and stability necessary 
  to constitute a family relationship. Usually a long period of cohabitation is 
  required. But even that is not always an essential. In <I>Chios Property 
  Investment Co. Ltd v. Lopez</I> (1987) 20 H.L.R. 120 cohabitation for two 
  years still enabled the woman to qualify as a member of the tenant's family. 
  Neither in that case nor in <I>Dyson </I>did the absence of any children 
  prevent the person from ranking as a member of the other's family. The 
  recognition by the courts that heterosexual partnerships should rank as 
  families for the purpose of the succession to statutory tenancies was taken up 
  by Parliament and made a matter of express enactment in paragraph 2 of 
  Schedule 4 to the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A>, 
  inserting paragraph 2(2) into Schedule 1 to the Rent Act 1977. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=69>The judges in <I>Helby v. Rafferty</I> had difficulty 
  in accepting that a word which had been repeated throughout the successive 
  Rent Acts could change its meaning from time to time. But as matter of 
  construction I see no grounds for treating the provisions with which are 
  concerned as being in the relatively rare category of cases where Parliament 
  intended the language to be fixed at the time when the original Act was

  to very old statutes (<I>Governors of the Campbell College Belfast v. 
  Commissioner of Valuation for Northern Ireland</I> [1964] 2 All E.R. 705). The 
  general presumption is that an updating construction is to be applied

  But in any event in relation to the problem in the present case the meaning of 
  the word "family" in its sense of a group united by some tie or bond such as 
  blood, marriage or personal affection may not have as matter of language 
  altered. What has changed are the precise personal associations to which the 
  concept may now be applied. The essential meaning of the word has not changed 
  over the intervening years, but changes in social habits and opinions may 
  affect the propriety of its application to new circumstances. Thus the test 
  for its application comes to be the ordinary popular understanding of the word 
  at the date when its falls to be applied. That in the present case is the date 
  of the death of the original tenant. </A>

  <LI value=70><A name=70>In <I>Ross v. Collins</I> [1964] 1 W.L.R. 425, where 
  an unpaid housekeeper was held not to be a member of the tenant's family, 
  there being no evidence to establish a relationship of father and daughter, 
  Russell L.J. observed (p. 432): 
  <UL>&nbsp;"But two strangers cannot, it seems to me, ever establish 
    artificially for the purposes of this section a familial nexus by acting as 
    brothers or as sisters, even if they call each other such and consider their 
    relationship to be tantamount to that. Nor, in my view, can an adult man and 
    woman who establish a platonic relationship establish a familial nexus by 
    acting as a devoted brother and sister or father and daughter would act, 
    even if they address each other as such and even if they refer to each other 
    as such and regard their association as tantamount to such. Nor, in my view, 
    would they indeed be recognised as familial links by the ordinary man." </UL>
  <P>In that case Russell L.J, recognised that "family" was not limited to cases 
  of a strict legal familial nexus, but that it still required "a broadly 
  recognisable de facto familial nexus." He considered that that could be found: 

  <UL>&nbsp;"where the link would be strictly familial had there been a 
    marriage, or where the link is through adoption of a minor, de jure or de 
    facto, or where the link is 'step-', or where the link is 'in-law' or by 
    marriage." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=71><A name=71>Certainly it has proved difficult to establish a 
  family relationship where the connection is usually by blood, other than in 
  cases where there is a relationship like that of parent and child. We are not 
  concerned in the present case with the problems of the extent to which persons 
  not in a relationship of sexual intimacy may qualify as members of a family. 
  But it may be observed that in relation to these other kinds of case, blood 
  and adoption have not been prescribed as limits. In <I>Brock v. Wollams</I> 
  [1949] 2 K.B. 388 the defendant had resided with the tenant since her 
  childhood and had continued to reside with him until his death apart from a 
  period of some three years. She had not been legally adopted by him but was 
  nevertheless held to be a member of his family. In <I>Jones v. Whitehill</I> 
  [1950] 2 K.B. 204 a niece of the tenant's wife went to live with her aunt and 
  her aunt's husband, the tenant, to look after them in their declining years. 
  It was held that in accordance with the ordinary use of language she was a 
  member of the tenant's family, essentially, as it would seem, on account of 
  her dedication to caring for them, although, as was pointed out in <I>Ross v. 
  Collins </I>(p. 431), there was the pre-existing relationship of being a niece 
  of the tenant's wife. In <I>Carega Properties S.A. v. Sharratt</I> [1979] 1 
  W.L.R. 928 a young man of 24 formed a friendship with a widow of 75 and lived 
  with her on terms which were described as platonic and filial. His mother was 
  alive and would not accept that the widow should speak of him as her son, and 
  he referred to the widow as his aunt. Lord Diplock expressly refrained from 
  any general consideration of the scope of the statutory phrase or the extent 
  to which changed social attitudes might have enlarged the meaning of the word 
  "family." The decision must accordingly be regarded purely as one turning on 
  its own facts. It may be noted that, as appears from the report of the 
  decision in the Appeal Court [1978] 2 All ER 948, 953, no suggestion was made 
  in argument of any change in the meaning of the phrase "member of the tenant's 
  family" in relation to the facts in that particular case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=72><A name=72>In so far as some more general guidance is sought to 
  be found from the observations by Russell L.J. in <I>Ross v. Collins</I> I do 
  not find it altogether helpful in seeking the substance of the bond which 
  constitutes a group as a family to use the expression "familial nexus" which 
  still leaves the word "familial" to be explained. Nor do I regard his list of 
  examples where the nexus may be found as intended to be comprehensive or 
  exhaustive. It is however to be noted that he does not exclude the possibility 
  of two strangers establishing a "familial nexus" as a cohabiting couple, 
  whether heterosexual or homosexual, although a relationship which was merely 
  artificial would not suffice, and a platonic relationship might have 
  difficulty in qualifying. Problems may yet arise with regard to relationships 
  other than the kind of relationship which is before us in the present case. I 
  do not find it necessary to explore the further application of family 
  membership beyond such cases and I find little guidance in the cases, such as 
  <I>Carega</I>, which have been concerned with other kinds of relationship. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=73><A name=73>The problem in the present case is to determine what, 
  short of blood or marriage, may evidence the common bond in a partnership of 
  two adult persons which may entitle the one to be in the common judgment of 
  society a member of the other's family. It seems to me that essentially the 
  bond must be one of love and affection, not of a casual or transitory nature, 
  but in a relationship which is permanent or at least intended to be so. As a 
  result of that personal attachment to each other other characteristics will 
  follow, such as a readiness to support each other emotionally and financially, 
  to care for and look after the other in times of need, and to provide a 
  companionship in which mutual interests and activities can be shared and 
  enjoyed together. It would be difficult to establish such a bond unless the 
  couple were living together in the same house. It would also be difficult to 
  establish it without an active sexual relationship between them or at least 
  the potentiality of such a relationship. If they have or are caring for 
  children whom they regard as their own they would make the family designation 
  more immediately obvious, but the existence of children is not a necessary 
  element. Each case will require to depend eventually upon its own facts. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=74><A name=74>The concept of the family has undergone significant 
  development during recent years, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. 
  Whether that is a matter for concern or congratulation is of no relevance to 
  the present case, but it is properly part of the judicial function to 
  endeavour to reflect an understanding of such changes in the reality of social 
  life. Social groupings have come to take a number of different forms. The form 
  of the single parent family has been long recognised. A more open acceptance 
  of differences in sexuality allows a greater recognition of the possibility of 
  domestic groupings of partners of the same sex. The formal bond of marriage is 
  now far from being a significant criterion for the existence of a family unit. 
  While it remains as a particular formalisation of the relationship between 
  heterosexual couples, family units may now be recognised to exist both where 
  the principal members are in a heterosexual relationship and where they are in 
  a homosexual or lesbian relationship. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=75><A name=75>In <I>T, Petitioner</I>, 1997 S.L.T. 724 an adoption 
  order was made where the petitioner was proposing to bring up the child 
  jointly with another person with whom he was cohabiting in a homosexual 
  relationship. Such a group can readily be described as constituting a family. 
  But just as in regard to heterosexual couples the existence of children was 
  not a necessary factor for entitling the couple to qualify as a family, so 
  also, as it seems to me, the couple should qualify by themselves, just as they 
  would continue to do after the adopted child had grown up and started an 
  independent life. In this connection it is interesting to note the use of the 
  word "family" in the judgment of Singer J. in <I>In re W. (A Minor) (Adoption: 
  Homosexual Adopter)</I> [1998] Fam. 58 where (at p. 59) he said in relation to 
  the placement of the child whose adoption was in dispute, "The family in 
  question comprises two women living together in lesbian relationship." He 
  there recognises the couple as constituting a family. That language seems to 
  me to reflect what is now an ordinary usage. In my view a homosexual couple 
  can qualify as a family for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the 
  Act of 1977 and if that is possible I have no doubt at all that in the 
  circumstances of the present case the appellant does qualify as a member of 
  the former tenant's family. On the facts before us such a conclusion is 
  irresistible. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=76><A name=76>The conclusion which I have reached seems to me to 
  accord with the purpose of the legislation. The main objects of the Rent Acts 
  are the giving to tenants of fair rents and a security of tenure 
  (<I>Megarry</I>: <I>Rent Acts</I> 11th ed. (1988), Vol.1, p. 18). The purpose 
  of the statutory provisions on succession, in their various formulations, may 
  be taken to be to ensure that the security of tenure is not weakened by the 
  inability of those closely bound to him to remain in residence by right after 
  his death. The view which I have taken in the present case seems at least 
  consistent with the evident purpose of the legislation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=77><A name=77>The view which I have taken finds some support in the 
  decision of the Court of Appeals in New York in <I>Braschi v. Stahl Associates 
  Co.</I> (1989) 544 N.Y.S. 2d 784. That case concerned landlord and tenant 
  legislation forbidding the eviction of a "member of the deceased tenant's 
  family who has been living with the tenant." The Court looked to the general 
  social purpose of the statute, the protection of tenants, the prevention of 
  dislocation and the preservation of family units. The Court stated, at p. 789: 

  <UL>&nbsp;"In the context of eviction, a more realistic, and certainly 
    equally valid, view of a family includes two adult lifetime partners whose 
    relationship is long term and characterised by an emotional and financial 
    commitment and interdependence. This view comports both with our society's 
    traditional concept of 'family' and with the expectations of individuals who 
    live in such nuclear units." </UL>
  <P>This approach is in conformity with that which commends itself to me, that 
  the concept of "family" is now to be regarded as extending to a homosexual 
  partnership. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=78><A name=78>I should stress that the present case is to be 
  distinguished from that of spouses or unmarried couples living in a 
  relationship where marriage may be possible. I am not holding that a 
  homosexual partnership is like or is akin to such a relationship. Indeed, as I 
  have already held, I do not consider that paragraph 2(2), as presently worded, 
  can be extended to cover such a case. So the cases to which we were referred 
  where a matter of discrimination was raised between the position of 
  heterosexual and homosexual couples is not in my view of direct assistance. 
  Nor does not seem to me useful to employ such expressions as a relationship 
  "akin to marriage." Indeed the appellant has in his written case expressly 
  declared that the present case does not give rise to questions about any right 
  on the part of persons of the same sex to marry or to acquire a particular 
  legal status. It would be wrong to regard the present case as one about the 
  rights of homosexuals. It is simply a matter of the application of ordinary 
  language to this particular statutory provision in the light of current social 
  conditions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=79><A name=79>Furthermore the present case is to be distinguished 
  from cases concerned with the idea of family status, such as the Canadian case 
  of <I>Attorney-General of Canada v. Mossop</I> (1993) 100 D.L.R. (4th) 658. In 
  that case the Supreme Court held, on the narrow base on which the case was 
  argued, that the expression "family status" did not include a homosexual 
  relationship. But the definition of "family status" may be narrower than the 
  word "family." In the Court of Appeal Marceau J.A. observed (quoted at p. 667 
  of the report): 
  <UL>&nbsp;"Even if we were to accept that two homosexual lovers can 
    constitute 'sociologically speaking' a sort of family, it is certainly not 
    one which is now recognised by law as giving its members special rights and 
    obligations." </UL>
  <P>Lamer C.J.C. observed of the Supreme Court's decision (p. 674) that it 
  "should not be interpreted as meaning that homosexual couples cannot 
  constitute a "family" for the purposes of legislation other than the C.H.R.A. 
  In this regard, each statute must be interpreted in its own context." </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=80><A name=80>Nor does the decision which I have reached conflict 
  with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice or the European Court 
  of Human Rights. As was recognised by the European Court of Justice in 
  <I>Grant v. South West Trains Ltd.</I> [1998] 3 B.H.R.C. 578 at 594 para. 35: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"in the present state of the law within the Community, stable 
    relationships between two persons of the same sex are not regarded as 
    equivalent to marriages or stable relationships outside marriage between 
    persons of the opposite sex." </UL>
  <P>Thus the European Court of Human Rights has in <I>Rees v. U.K.</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/11.html">(1987) 9 EHRR 56</a> and <I>Cossey v. U.K.</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1990/21.html">(1991) 13 EHRR 622</a> confined the 
  application of Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights to the 
  traditional marriage between persons of opposite biological sex. Article 12 
  refers to the right "to marry and to found a family" and in that context it is 
  easy to understand that the word "family" may be restricted in its scope. 
  Article 8 provides the right "to respect for his private and family life." In 
  this context the Commission has held that a stable homosexual relationship 
  between two men does not fall within the scope of the right to respect for 
  family life, but that such a relationship may be a matter affecting private 
  life (<I>S. v. U.K. App.</I>11716/85 47 D.R. 274). Some protection for such a 
  relationship is thus recognised in the Human Rights jurisprudence. Moreover in 
  the developing jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights it is 
  recognised that family life is not confined to families based on marriage but 
  may encompass other de facto relationships such as that in <I>X, Y and Z v. 
  U.K.</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../eu/cases/ECHR/1997/20.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1997/20.html">(1997) 24 EHRR 143</a></a> where X had by gender reassignment surgery 
  come to live as a man with Y, who was a woman, and her child, Z, who had been 
  born through AID treatment. In <I>Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal</I> 
  (no. 33290/96 1.12.98) a homosexual claimed that an award of custody of his 
  daughter to her mother was an unjustified interference with his right to 
  respect for family life, and also with his right to respect for his private 
  life since he was required in respect of his right of access to his daughter 
  to conceal from her his homosexuality. His claim was held admissible. That the 
  relationship in the present case may not as the law currently stands 
  constitute "family life" for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention, does 
  not require a restrictive meaning to be given to the reference to a tenant's 
  family in the legislation before us. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=81><A name=81>It was suggested that if the present appeal was 
  allowed there would be great uncertainty in the ascertainment of successors to 
  statutory tenancies. I am not persuaded that such fears are justified. There 
  may at present be need on occasion to explore the facts of particular cases to 
  discover whether a person was living with the original tenant "as his or her 
  wife or husband." In relation to the word "family", it is difficult to devise 
  a construction which will obviate inquiry unless a very restrictive view of 
  the scope of a family is taken. Once it is accepted, as it has been in the 
  cases, that the application extends beyond the scope of strictly legal 
  relationships, some inquiry may well be involved into the facts which are 
  alleged to be sufficient to constitute the necessary nexus. It does not seem 
  to me that the recognition that a person living together with another in a 
  homosexual relationship may qualify as a member of the other's family is 
  likely to lead to any significant uncertainties in the application of the 
  statutory provision. </TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR><TD></A>

  <LI value=82><A name=82>Ward L.J. expressed an anxiety that he might be 
  exceeding the limits of the judicial function in reaching his decision. 
  Judicial activism certainly has to be tempered by due restraint, and the 
  drawing of the boundary of the judicial task is often delicate and sometimes 
  controversial. I do not consider that the boundary is being passed in the 
  present case. What we are concerned with is the application of a word 
  recognised as being loose and flexible. Parliament has in other contexts 
  provided definitions of the kind of relationships which it intends should be 
  affected by particular provisions. For example under section 113 of the 
  Housing Act 1985 a person was a "member of another's family" if he was the 
  spouse of that person, or if he and that person lived together as husband and 
  wife, or if he was that person's parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, 
  brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece. In marked distinction to that 
  kind of approach Parliament has in relation to protected tenancies under the 
  Rent Act 1977 left the word "family" to be applied by the Courts without the 
  guidance of statutory definition. The court in <I>Dyson</I> accordingly 
  applied the word as was appropriate to the social circumstances prevailing at 
  that period, innovating on its earlier application. If, as I believe, the word 
  is now appropriate to cover a homosexual partnership of the kind which existed 
  in the present case, it seems to me consistent with the intention of 
  Parliament that it should be so applied. </A>

  <LI value=88><A name=88>Two issues arise in relation to Mr. Fitzpatrick's

  original tenant as his or her wife or husband" within the meaning of those

  the negative, the second issue is whether Mr. Fitzpatrick "was a member of the

  time of and for the period of two years immediately before his death" within 
  the meaning of paragraph 3(1) of the Schedule. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=89><A name=89>The central thrust of the argument advanced by Mr. 
  Blake Q.C. on behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick was that the intention of Parliament 
  was to give protection to a person living with the deceased tenant in a close 
  personal relationship and that a broad and purposive approach should be given 
  to paragraphs 2(2) or 3(1) of the Schedule. It was submitted that there is now 
  widespread public acceptance of homosexuality and public recognition that 
  homosexuals live together in stable, loving and permanent unions in the same 
  way as men and women live together. A permanent and loving union between 
  homosexuals is akin to marriage and therefore should come within the 
  protection which Parliament gives to a person who has lived with a tenant as 
  his or her wife or husband or to a person who was a member of the tenant's 
  family residing with him. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=90><A name=90>These arguments were rejected by the majority of the 
  Court of Appeal. All three judgments in the Court of Appeal subjected the 
  issues arising in this difficult case to detailed analysis and made a careful 
  survey of the history of the relevant legislation and of the numerous 
  authorities. At the conclusion of his judgment Waite L.J., whilst recognising 
  the devoted and faithful life shared by Mr. Thompson and Mr. Fitzpatrick, 
  stated, at page 318: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The survey which I have undertaken in this judgment shows, 
    however, that the law in England regarding succession to statutory tenancies 
    is firmly rooted in the concept of the family as an entity bound together by 
    ties of kinship (including adoptive status) or marriage. The only 
    relaxation, first by court decision and then by statute, has been a 
    willingness to treat heterosexual cohabitants as if they were husband and 
    wife." </UL>
  <P>Roch L.J. concluded his judgment at page 324 as follows: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with both Waite and Ward L.JJ. that the terms of 
    Schedule 1 should be reconsidered with a view to bringing cases such as the 
    present within the protection of the Schedule. No doubt Parliament will 
    consider whether the protection should be that afforded by paragraph 2 or 
    that afforded by paragraph 3 of the Schedule. Nevertheless, I am convinced 
    that it is for Parliament to make the necessary changes after debate when 
    considerations which may not have been raised in this appeal and which may 
    not be apparent to this court can be taken into account." </UL>
  <P>Applying a functionalist approach to the construction of paragraphs 2(2) 
  and 3(1) the conclusion of Ward L.J. at page 338 on the first issue was: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would say there is no essential difference between a 
    homosexual and a heterosexual couple and, accordingly, I would find that the 
    plaintiff had lived with the deceased tenant as his husband or wife." </UL>
  <P>On the second issue he stated at page 339: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The test has to be whether the relationship of the 
    plaintiff to the deceased was one where there is at least a broadly 
    recognisable de facto familial nexus. I would not define that familial nexus 
    in terms of its structures or components: I would rather focus on familial 
    functions. The question is more what a family does rather than what a family 
    is. A family unit is a social organisation which functions through its 
    linking its members closely together. The functions may be procreative, 
    sexual, sociable, economic, emotional. The list is not exhaustive. Not all 
    families function in the same way. Save for the ability to procreate, these 
    functions were present in the relationship between the deceased and the 
    plaintiff." </UL>
  <P><I>The First Issue: Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 1</I> </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=91><A name=91>The primary submission advanced on behalf of Mr. 
  Fitzpatrick to this House was that Parliament intended the words "living with 
  the original tenant as his or her husband or wife" to be a broad term to be 
  interpreted by the courts on an incremental basis to include any relationship 
  akin to marriage and not just a relationship between partners of opposite 
  sexes. I share the opinion of all your Lordships that Mr. Fitzpatrick is not 
  entitled to claim that he was living with Mr. Thompson as his wife or husband 
  within the meaning of paragraph 2(2). A person can only live with a man as his 
  wife when that person is a woman, and accordingly Mr. Fitzpatrick cannot claim 
  to have been living with Mr. Thompson as his wife. Similarly a person can only 
  live with another person as a husband when that other person is a woman, and 
  accordingly Mr. Fitzpatrick cannot claim to have been living with Mr. Thompson 
  as his husband. In <I>Harrogate Borough Council v. Simpson</I> (1984) 17 
  H.L.R. 205 the Court of Appeal held that the expression "living together as 
  husband and wife" in section 50 of the Housing Act 1980 is not apt to include 
  a lesbian relationship and I am in agreement with the opinion of Ewbank J. at 
  page 210 that: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The essential characteristic of living together as husband and 
    wife, in my judgment, is that there should be a man and a woman and that 
    they should be living together in the same household." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=92><A name=92>Accordingly I am unable to agree with the conclusion 
  of Ward L.J. because I consider that it fails to take account of the essential 
  requirement of paragraph 2(2) which is that the claimant must have been living 
  with a male original tenant as his wife or with a female original tenant as 
  her husband. 
  <P><I>The Second Issue: Paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1</I> </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=93><A name=93>The secondary submission advanced on behalf of Mr. 
  Fitzpatrick was that if the wording of paragraph 2(2) excludes the 
  relationship of a couple of the same sex, the consideration that that 
  relationship is akin to marriage nevertheless qualifies it as being familial 
  in character so that within the meaning of paragraph 3(1) Mr. Fitzpatrick was 
  a member of Mr. Thompson's family. In considering this submission it is 
  relevant at the outset to have regard to the scheme of Schedule 1 to the Rent 
  Act 1977. Whilst in earlier provisions in the Rent Acts legislation a 
  distinction was not drawn between a widower of the tenant and a member of the 
  tenant's family so that under the 1920 Act it was held that a widower was a 
  member of the tenant's family (see <I>Salter v. Lask </I>[1925] 1 K.B. 584), 
  it is apparent that Schedule 1 to the 1977 Act deals separately with the 
  surviving spouse of the tenant and a person living with the tenant as his or 
  her wife or husband on the one hand and with a member of the tenant's family 
  on the other hand. If Mr. Fitzpatrick were entitled to claim the protection 
  given by Schedule 1 it would appear appropriate that he should obtain 
  protection under paragraph 2 and not under paragraph 3, because the essence of 
  his claim is that the relationship which he shared with Mr. Thompson was the 
  same relationship as that shared between a husband and wife or a couple living 
  together as husband and wife, save that the relationship was homosexual and 
  not heterosexual. Therefore if (as I would hold) Parliament did not intend 
  that a homosexual partner should obtain protection under paragraph 2, it would 
  appear to be a somewhat strained and artificial construction to hold that Mr 
  Fitzpatrick is entitled to obtain protection under paragraph 3. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=94><A name=94>In <I>Harrogate Borough Council v. Simpson</I> (1984) 
  17 H.L.R. 205, 210 Watkins L.J. stated: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Davies, who appears for the plaintiffs, contends that, 
    if Parliament had wished homosexual relationships to be brought into the 
    realm of the lawfully recognised state of a living together of man and wife 
    for the purpose of the relevant legislation, it would plainly have so stated 
    in that legislation, and it has not done so. I am bound to say that I 
    entirely agree with that." </UL>
  <P>If it was the intention of Parliament that a homosexual partner should have 
  the same protection under the Rent Acts as a heterosexual partner I think that 
  in 1988 Parliament would have used express words in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 
  1 to place a homosexual partner in the same position as an unmarried 
  heterosexual partner rather than leave it to the courts to extend the meaning 
  of the phrase "a member of the original tenant's family" in paragraph 3(1) to 
  include a homosexual relationship. Instead in paragraph 2(2) Parliament used 
  terminology similar to that recently held by the Court of Appeal in the 
  <I>Simpson</I> case to be confined to a heterosexual relationship. 
  <P>It is also necessary to recognise that the construction of paragraph 3(1) 
  is, in part, a question of law. The meaning given to the word "family" may 
  vary depending upon the context in which it is used and the popular meaning 
  given to the word may change to some extent with the passage of the years, but 
  the decision of this House in <I>Carega Properties S.A. v. Sharratt</I> [1979] 
  1 W.L.R. 928 makes it clear that in the context of paragraph 3(1) the meaning 
  given to the word "family" cannot be extended beyond the limits permitted by 
  the law. In <I>Carega</I>, referring to the judgment of Megaw L.J. in that 
  case in the Court of Appeal, Lord Diplock said at 931C: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"Megaw L.J. after quoting the 'Cohen question' went on to say, in 
    my view quite correctly [1979] 1 W.L.R. 3, 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . it is for 
    this court to decide, where such an issue arises, whether, assuming all the 
    facts found by the judge to be correct, the question may, as a matter of 
    law, within the permissible limits of the meaning of the phrase 'a member of 
    the tenant's family,' be answered 'Yes.'" </UL>
  <P>And Viscount Dilhorne said at page 932B 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lords, the meaning to be given to the words 'a member of 
    the original tenant's family' in Schedule 1, paragraph 3 to the Rent Act 
    1968 is in my view a question of law. 'Family' is a word the content of 
    which varies with the context in which it is used. When used in a statute, 
    it has not in my opinion the same meaning as the word 'household.' While a 
    household may consist only of members of a family, it can include persons 
    not capable of being so regarded. I accordingly cannot accept the argument 
    that 'family' in the Act can be read as meaning 'household.' While the 
    question which Cohen L.J. said in <I>Brock v. Wollams</I> [1949] 2 K.B. 388, 
    395 the county court judge should have asked himself, namely: 'Would an 
    ordinary man, addressing his mind to the question whether Mrs. Wollams was a 
    member of the family or not, have answered 'yes' or 'no,' has not 
    infrequently been posed, the answer to the question is not likely to extract 
    any more than the judge's personal view. It is to the highest degree 
    unlikely that a judge would ever say: 'I think the answer is 'Yes' but I 
    think an ordinary man would say 'No,' and if a judge did that he would in my 
    opinion be wrong. </UL>
  <P>
  <UL>&nbsp;It is for the judge to construe the statute and it is for him to 
    state his conclusion as to the meaning to be given to the word 'family' in 
    the context in which it appears, giving it, unless the context otherwise 
    requires, its ordinary natural meaning." 
  </UL></TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR><TD>
  <P>As Viscount Dilhorne then stated that he would have been content to agree 
  with the judgment of Megaw L.J. and the speech of Lord Diplock it is clear 
  that when he said that it was for the judge to give the word "family" its 
  ordinary natural meaning he accepted that it was within the limits permitted 
  by the law, as is also clear from his first sentence. 
  <P>Therefore I turn to the speech of Lord Diplock in the <I>Carega</I> case 
  (with which Lord Elwyn-Jones, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton and Lord Russell of 
  Killowen agreed) to determine whether the law as there stated permits the 
  answer that Mr. Fitzpatrick was a member of Mr. Thompson's family. In that 
  case there was a close platonic relationship between the elderly tenant and a 
  young man and they treated themselves as aunt and nephew and were so regarded 
  by others. In his judgment the county court judge said: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"He stuck by her to the end. Nobody else in her family did so. Had 
    it not been for the presence of the defendant, in the last five years she 
    would have been obliged to enter a nursing home or else her family would 
    have had to arrange to receive her into their midst. She was able to remain 
    in her home, to be looked after by a much younger person. . . . Their 
    relationship was sensitive, loving, intellectual and platonic." </UL>
  <P>and his conclusion was that: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"Lady Salter and this defendant achieved through their 
    relationship what must surely be regarded in a popular sense, and in common 
    sense, as a familial nexus. That is to say, a nexus such as one would find 
    only within a family. I am sure Shakespeare's man would say: 'Yes, it is 
    stranger than fiction, but they established a familial tie. Everyone linked 
    to her through the blood was remote by comparison with the defendant.'" </UL>
  <P>The Court of Appeal reversed this decision and the decision of the Court of 
  Appeal was upheld by this House. The reason for upholding the decision of the 
  Court of Appeal was stated as follows by Lord Diplock at page 931E: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>Gammans v. Ekins</I> was a case of co-habitation by an 
    unmarried couple, a relationship which raises questions upon which I find it 
    unnecessary and inappropriate to enter for the purpose of disposing of the 
    instant appeal. <I>Ross v. Collins</I>, on the other hand, was much like the 
    instant case, save that the sexes of the older party, who was devotedly 
    cared for, and the younger party who did the caring, were reversed. As my 
    reason for dismissing the instant appeal, I would not seek to improve upon 
    what was said there by my noble and learned friend (then Russell L.J.), at 
    p. 432: </UL>
  <P>
  <UL>&nbsp;"Granted that 'family' is not limited to cases of a strict legal 
    familial nexus, I cannot agree that it extends to a case such as this. It 
    still requires, it seems to me, at least a broadly recognisable de facto 
    familial nexus. This may be capable of being found and recognised as such by 
    the ordinary man--where the link would be strictly familial had there been a 
    marriage, or where the link is through adoption of a minor, de jure or de 
    facto, or where the link is 'step-,' or where the link is 'in-law' or by 
    marriage. But two strangers cannot, it seems to me, ever establish 
    artificially for the purposes of this section a familial nexus by acting as 
    brothers or as sisters, even if they call each other such and consider their 
    relationship to be tantamount to that. Nor, in my view, can an adult man and 
    woman who establish a platonic relationship establish a familial nexus by 
    acting as a devoted brother and sister or father and daughter would act, 
    even if they address each other as such and even if they refer to each other 
    as such and regard their association as tantamount to such. Nor, in my view, 
    would they indeed be recognised as familial links by the ordinary man." 
  </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=95><A name=95>Accordingly for a claimant to be a member of the 
  tenant's family there must be a relationship to the tenant by marriage or 
  blood or adoption, or a link which resembles such a relationship and which can 
  be broadly recognised as such, and in that case it was not sufficient that 
  there was a loving, caring and supportive relationship between the young man 
  and the tenant, Lady Salter. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=96><A name=96>It can be argued with some force that the adoption by 
  Lord Diplock of the passage from the judgment of Russell L.J. in <I>Ross v. 
  Collins</I> does not constitute a ratio decidendi binding upon your Lordships 
  in the present appeal. This is because at the commencement of his speech Lord 
  Diplock stated that the appeal concerned a relationship where there had been 
  no connection by way of regular sexual intercourse (past or present) between 
  the claimant and the tenant and he then stated at page 930A: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The facts of the instant case, if they are not unique, are 
    certainly most unusual, and for that reason they do not, in my opinion, 
    provide a suitable occasion for this House to undertake a general 
    consideration of what persons may be included in the expression 'a member of 
    the original tenant's family' where at the time of the tenant's death there 
    did exist between him and the claimant to a statutory tenancy by succession 
    a relationship of one or other of the various kinds to which I have referred 
    above. In particular, the difficult question posed by <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd. 
    v. Fox</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html">[1976] QB 503</a></a> as to the extent, if any, to which changed social 
    attitudes towards cohabitation between unmarried couples and the offspring 
    of such liaisons may have enlarged the meaning of the expression 'family' in 
    the Rent Act 1968 does not arise in the instant case and is best left for 
    consideration in the light of the actual facts of a case in which it does 
    arise." </UL>
  <P>I consider that the reference to "cohabitation between unmarried couples 
  and the offspring of such liaisons" shows that Lord Diplock's earlier 
  reference to connection by way of regular sexual intercourse referred to a 
  heterosexual couple and not to a homosexual couple. However, if it is not a 
  binding decision, in my opinion the passage from the judgment of Russell L.J. 
  adopted by Lord Diplock gives clear guidance as to the approach which should 
  be taken by your Lordships in determining the limits of the term "family" in 
  paragraph 3(1), and I consider that Mr. Fitzpatrick does not qualify as a 
  member of Mr. Thompson's family because he had no relationship with Mr. 
  Thompson by marriage or blood or adoption and no link with him which was 
  broadly recognisable as creating de facto such a relationship. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=97><A name=97>Mr. Blake relied on the decision of the Court of 
  Appeal in <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd. v. Fox</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html">[1976] QB 503</a></a> in support of the 
  submission that the term "family" is a word of flexible meaning which can 
  change with the passage of the years, and that in the light of the changed 
  public attitude to homosexuality the term should now include a stable and 
  lasting homosexual relationship. In that case a woman had lived with the 
  tenant of a house as if she were his wife for 21 years until his death, but 
  they had never married and had no children. The Court of Appeal held that the 
  woman was a member of the tenant's "family" within the meaning of the Rent 
  Acts. In the judgments reference was made to the earlier decision of the Court 
  of Appeal in <I>Gammans v. Ekins</I> [1950] 2 K.B. 328 where it was held that 
  a man who had lived for 20 years with a female tenant did not acquire the 
  status of membership of the tenant's family. Referring to <I>Gammans v. 
  Ekins</I> James L.J. said at page 511C: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The strongly expressed view was that as at 1949, the relevant 
    date, the popular meaning of 'family' did not include the male consort of a 
    female tenant whose relationship had all the incidence of a marriage short 
    of the birth of a child and all the outward appearances of marriage. Between 
    1950 and 1975 there have been many changes in the law effected by statute 
    and decisions of the courts. Many changes have their foundation in the 
    changed needs and views of society. Such changes have occurred in the field 
    of family law and equitable interests in property. The popular meaning given 
    to the word 'family' is not fixed once and for all time. I have no doubt 
    that with the passage of years it has changed. The cases reveal that it is 
    not restricted to blood relationships and those created by the marriage 
    ceremony. It can include de facto as well as de jure relationships. The 
    popular meaning of 'family'in 1975 would, according to the answer of the 
    ordinary man, include the defendant as a member of Mr. Wright's family." 
  </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=98><A name=98>In my opinion the decision in <I>Dyson</I> does not 
  assist Mr. Fitzpatrick's case and does not support an argument that because 
  the Court of Appeal brought a stable and lasting heterosexual relationship 
  outside marriage within the ambit of the term "family", a court should now, in 
  the light of society's changed attitudes, bring a stable and lasting 
  homosexual relationship within the ambit of that term. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=99><A name=99>Parliament has recognised the decision in <I>Dyson</I> 
  but did so in 1988 in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 1 to the 1977 Act by words 
  which expressly confine the relationship outside marriage to a heterosexual 
  relationship. Moreover in his judgment in <I>Dyson</I> at page 511D James L.J. 
  said: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The cases reveal that [the word 'family'] is not restricted to 
    blood relationships and those created by the marriage ceremony. It can 
    include de facto as well as de jure relationships." </UL>
  <P>Therefore, notwithstanding that in <I>Carega</I> Lord Diplock reserved 
  comment on <I>Dyson</I>, the decision can be regarded as coming within the 
  principle stated by Russell L.J. that "'family' . . . requires . . . at least 
  a broadly recognisable de facto familial nexus." In <I>Dyson</I> the 
  relationship was recognisable as a de facto marriage and therefore could be 
  regarded as a family relationship. Stephenson L.J. stated the point, correctly 
  in my opinion, in the following way in <I>Watson v. Lucas</I> [1980] 1 W.L.R. 
  1493, 1501F: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ordinary man has to consider whether a man or a woman 
    is a member of a family in the light of the facts, and whatever may have 
    been held before <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd v. Fox</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html">[1976] QB 503</a></a> I do not 
    think a judge, putting himself in the place of the ordinary man, can 
    consider an association which has every outward appearance of marriage, 
    except the false pretence of being married, as not constituting a family. If 
    it looks like a marriage in the old and perhaps obsolete sense of a lifelong 
    union, with nothing casual or temporary about it, it is a family until the 
    House of Lords declares (as Mr. Semken reserves his right to ask them to 
    declare) that <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd v. Fox</I> was wrongly decided because 
    the reasoning of the majority was wrong. The time has gone by when the 
    courts can hold such a union not to be 'familial' simply because the parties 
    to it do not pretend to be married in due form of law." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=100><A name=100>In <I>Gammans v. Ekins</I> Jenkins L.J. had 
  considered the relationship of an unmarried heterosexual couple who had 
  children and at page 332 had stated the matter in the same way as Stephenson 
  L.J.: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The situation assumed would present de facto what might be 
    described as the equivalent of a marriage, with the natural consequences of 
    a marriage." </UL>
  <P>Therefore I consider that for there to be a de facto family relationship 
  there must be the outward appearance of a de jure family relationship to which 
  it is equivalent, but because the essence of marriage is a relationship 
  between a man and a woman there is no de jure family relationship to which a 
  homosexual relationship is equivalent and, moreover, paragraph 2(2) makes it 
  clear that a homosexual relationship is not to be regarded as a de facto 
  equivalent of marriage. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=101><A name=101>The approach advocated on behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick 
  was adopted by the Court of Appeals of New York in <I>Braschi v. Stahl 
  Associates</I> (1989) 544 N.Y.S. 2nd 784 which held that the term "family" in 
  legislation protecting from eviction a person who had been living with a 
  deceased tenant, included an adult lifetime partner of the same sex as the 
  tenant whose relationship was long term and characterised by emotional and 
  financial committal and inter-dependence. In the majority judgment Titone J. 
  stated at pages 788-789: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The intended protection against sudden eviction should not rest 
    on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find 
    its foundation in the reality of family life. In the context of eviction, a 
    more realistic, and certainly equally valid, view of a family includes two 
    adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long term and characterized by 
    an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence. This view 
    comports both with our society's traditional concept of 'family' and with 
    the expectations of individuals who live in such nuclear units." </UL>
  <P>He then cited definitions of "family" from Webster's Dictionary--"a group 
  of people united by certain convictions or common affiliation" and from 
  Black's Law Dictionary--"primarily, the collective body of persons who live in 
  one house and under one head or management," and stated: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that, in using the term 
    'family', the Legislature intended to extend protection to those who reside 
    in households having all of the normal familial characteristics." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=102><A name=102>The definitions cited by Titone J. accord with the 
  second meaning of family given by the Oxford English Dictionary (the first 
  meaning being "the servants of a house; the household"): 
  <UL>&nbsp;"The body of persons who live in one house or under one head, 
    including parents, children, servants, etc." </UL>
  <P>but not with the third and narrower meaning: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"the group consisting of parents and their children whether living 
    together or not; in wider sense all those who are nearly connected by blood 
    or affinity." </UL>
  <P>In my opinion in this jurisdiction it would be contrary to Lord Diplock's 
  judgment in <I>Carega</I> to give the wider meaning to the term "family" and 
  accordingly I would not follow the approach of the New York Court. 
  <P>It was implicit in Mr. Blake's argument that when protection was given in 
  1920 to a member of the tenant's family by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage 
  Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920 the courts would not have held that a 
  homosexual partner was a member of the tenant's family. Mr. Blake's submission 
  was that the term "family" is always speaking and having regard to the greatly 
  changed public attitude towards homosexuality it can now be given a meaning 
  which includes a homosexual couple. In support of this submission Mr. Blake 
  relied on the speech of Lord Wilberforce in <I>Royal College of Nursing v. 
  D.H.S.S.</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html">[1981] AC 800</a></a>, 822: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"In interpreting an Act of Parliament it is proper, and 
    indeed necessary, to have regard to the state of affairs existing, and known 
    by Parliament to be existing, at the time. It is a fair presumption that 
    Parliament's policy or intention is directed to that state of affairs. 
    Leaving aside cases of omission by inadvertence, this being not such a case, 
    when a new state of affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on policy, 
    comes into existence, the courts have to consider whether they fall within 
    the Parliamentary intention. They may be held to do so, if they fall within 
    the same genus of facts as those to which the expressed policy has been 
    formulated. They may also be held to do so if there can be detected a clear 
    purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled if the extension is 
    made. How liberally these principles may be applied must depend upon the 
    nature of the enactment, and the strictness or otherwise of the words in 
    which it has been expressed." </UL></TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR><TD>
  <P>In my opinion this passage does not assist Mr. Blake. In 1920 the fact of 
  homosexuals living together in permanent relationships was known to 
  Parliament, and if a homosexual couple was not intended by Parliament to come 
  within the term "family" at that date I do not consider that changed public 
  attitudes towards homosexuality mean that a new state of affairs has come into 
  existence which extends the meaning of that term. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=103><A name=103>A further difficulty which confronts the argument on 
  behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick is that if it is correct and if the underlying 
  purpose of the legislation is to provide a secure home for a person who shares 
  his or her life with the tenant in a relationship of mutual affection, 
  commitment and support, it is difficult to see why two elderly spinsters who 
  live together for mutual support and companionship in old age without any 
  sexual element in their relationship and who give each other devoted care 
  should not qualify as members of the same family. I do not consider that the 
  absence of a sexual relationship distinguishes such a case from the present 
  one. The sexual relationship between a couple is a very important and 
  enriching part of their life together, but I am unable to accept that there is 
  such a distinction between an elderly homosexual couple who once had an active 
  sexual relationship and two elderly spinsters who never had a sexual 
  relationship that the homosexual couple should be regarded as members of each 
  other's family and the spinsters should not. If the courts depart from the 
  requirement of the link described by Russell L.J. and adopted by Lord Diplock 
  it is difficult to discern what criterion would include one person residing

  stated: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commission recalls that in a previous case it held that 
    the relationship of a woman with the child of her long-term lesbian partner 
    did not fall within the scope of family life, despite her sharing of a 
    parental role. The Commission found that despite the evolution of attitudes 
    towards homosexuality, a lesbian relationship did not fall within the scope 
    of the term 'family life'. Accordingly, Article 8 did not import a positive 
    obligation on a State to grant parental rights to a woman who was living 
    with the mother of a child. While homosexual relationships could raise 
    issues under the concept of 'private life', the Commission found that the 
    restriction complained of did not reveal any curtailment of the enjoyment of 
    their private life." </UL>

  <LI value=105><A name=105>It was submitted on behalf of Mr. Fitzpatrick that 
  the decision in the present case would be confined to the construction to be 
  given to the term "family" in the Rent Acts and that a decision allowing the 
  appeal would not have wider implications. I am unable to accept that 
  submission. I am of the opinion that a decision in the context of the Rent 
  Acts by your Lordship's House that because of changing ways of life and social 
  attitudes the homosexual partner of a deceased tenant was a member of the 
  latter's family could have considerable implications for the social life of 
  this country and in other spheres of the law. In <I>D.P.P. v. Lynch</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1975/5.html">[1975] AC 653</a> the issue was whether the defence of duress was open to a person 
  charged with murder as a principal in the second degree. In dissenting

  <UL>&nbsp;"I am all for recognising frankly that judges do make law. And I 
    am all for judges exercising this responsibility boldly at the proper time 
    and place--that is, where they can feel confident of having in mind, and 
    correctly weighed, all the implications of their decision, and where matters 
    of social policy are not involved which the collective wisdom of Parliament 
    is better suited to resolve (see <I>Launchbury v.

  <P>and Lord Kilbrandon said at page 700G: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"It will not do to claim that judges have the duty--call it the 
    privilege--of seeing to it that the common law expands and contracts to meet 
    what the judges conceive to be the requirements of modern society. Modern 
    society rightly prefers to exercise that function for itself, and this it 
    conveniently does through those who represent it in Parliament." </UL>
  <P>I consider that those observations apply with equal force to the issue in 
  the present case and that the decision whether for the purposes of the Rent 
  Act a homosexual is now to be regarded as a member of his partner's family or 
  whether the law should be changed in some other way to protect a homosexual 
  partner on the death of the tenant is a matter for Parliament to decide. </A>

  <LI value=106><A name=106>I fully recognise the strength of the argument,

  with and gave devoted care to deceased tenants. But in my opinion such changes 
  can only be made by Parliament and accordingly I would dismiss the appeal.

  <P>My Lords, </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=107><A name=107>In this action Mr Fitzpatrick claims a declaration 
  that he has succeeded to the tenancy of the late Mr Thompson of the ground 
  floor and basement flat at 75A Ravenscourt Road London W6. He submits that he 
  has this entitlement by virtue of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the First Schedule to 
  the Rent Act 1977 as amended by the Housing Acts 1980 and 1988: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"STATUTORY TENANTS BY SUCCESSION. </UL>
  <P>1.&nbsp;Paragraph 2 . . . below shall have effect, subject to section 2(3) 
  of this Act, for the purpose of determining who is the statutory tenant of a 
  dwelling-house by succession after the death of the person (in this Part of 
  this Schedule referred to as 'the original tenant') who, immediately before 
  his death, was a protected tenant of the dwelling-house or the statutory 
  tenant of it by virtue of his previous protected tenancy. 
  <P>2.&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;The surviving spouse (if any) of the original tenant, if 
  residing in the dwelling-house immediately before the death of the original 
  tenant, shall after the death be the statutory tenant if and so long as he or 
  she occupies the dwelling-house as his or her residence. 
  <P>&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;For the purposes of this paragraph, a person who was living 
  with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be treated as the 
  spouse of the original tenant. 
  <P>&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;If, immediately after the death of the original tenant, 
  there is, by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) above, more than one person who 
  fulfils the conditions in sub-paragraph (1) above, such one of them as may be 
  decided by agreement or, in default of agreement, by the county court shall be 
  treated as the surviving spouse for the purposes of this paragraph. 
  <P>3.&nbsp;Where paragraph 2 above does not apply, but a person who was a 
  member of the original tenant's family was residing with him in the 
  dwelling-house at the time of and for the period of two years immediately 
  before his death then, after his death, that person or if there is more than 
  one such person such one of them as may be decided by agreement, or in default 
  of agreement by the county court, shall be entitled to an assured tenancy of 
  the dwelling-house by succession." 
  <P>He primarily submits that he is the "surviving spouse" of Mr Thompson 
  because he was living with him "as his or her wife or husband" (paragraph 
  2(2)). Alternatively, he submits that he was residing with Mr Thompson "as a 
  member of [his] family" (paragraph 3). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=108><A name=108>The relevant facts are not in dispute. Mr 
  Fitzpatrick and Mr Thompson were wholly unrelated. They had first met in June 
  1969 when Mr Fitzpatrick did some gardening jobs for Mr Thompson. In 1972 Mr 
  Thompson became the tenant of the flat, entitled to the statutory protection 
  of the Rent Acts. In late 1976, by which time they had become close friends 
  and lovers, Mr Fitzpatrick moved in to live with Mr Thompson. Mr Thompson 
  worked as a silversmith; Mr Fitzpatrick had a job as a security guard. In 1982 
  Mr Thompson (now in his late 50s) was made redundant and could not get another 
  job. Mr Fitzpatrick changed his job to running a mobile snack bar, with which 
  Mr Thompson helped. In January 1986, Mr Thompson had a bad fall injuring his 
  head. He never recovered. He suffered a severe stroke. He was in a coma for a 
  long time and after that never spoke again. He required constant care. Mr 
  Fitzgerald was dissatisfied with the care which Mr Thompson was getting in 
  hospital and in April 1986, having given up his job, took Mr Thompson back to 
  the flat. Save for a short interruption, he continued to care for Mr Thompson 
  himself until he died in November 1994. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=109><A name=109>Their relationship was that of close friends and (at 
  least up to January 1982) homosexual lovers. The depth of the relationship was 
  demonstrated by the sacrifices which Mr Fitzpatrick made during the later 
  years and the loving care he gave Mr Thompson up to his death. It appears that 
  Mr Thompson had no relations or other friends to help care for him. No case of 
  financial dependency in either direction has been alleged. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=110><A name=110>The statutory provisions upon which Mr Fitzpatrick 
  relies form part of a scheme for the transfer of protected tenancies following 
  the death of the original tenant which Parliament has substantially revised 
  from time to time. Since legislation of this type was first introduced in 
  1915, the provisions have gone through a number of versions and most of the 
  decided cases have inevitably dealt with those earlier versions. In my 
  judgment, the current wording must be construed having regard to the revised 
  scheme of which it now forms part. Parliament has from time to time considered 
  and decided to what extent the rights of succession should be increased or 
  varied, most recently in 1988, and has amended the Act. The Act is social 
  legislation. There are competing social policies and choices that are relevant 
  to the decision what statutory rights of succession should be granted. The 
  situation is complex. There are conflicting interests; indeed the subject 
  matter of these provisions is private law property rights. Inevitably, 
  boundaries have to be drawn which may on occasions give rise to hard cases. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=111><A name=111>I mention this aspect not only because it is 
  important but also because it is possible to have sympathy for those in the 
  position of Mr Fitzpatrick. A social argument can be made on their behalf for 
  sympathetic treatment. They are at least as meritorious as some of those who 
  clearly come within the scheme. But likewise they are no less meritorious than 
  some of those who clearly fall outside the scheme--devoted and caring friends 
  who have lived for a long time with the tenant in the premises but have never 
  engaged in sexual relations with the tenant. Similarly, some may argue that, 
  in view of changing social attitudes to homosexual relationships, the time has 
  come as a matter of policy to equate such relationships with heterosexual 
  ones. But such matters are for Parliament, not the courts. It is an improper 
  usurpation of the legislative function, for a court to adopt social policies 
  which have not yet been incorporated in the relevant legislation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=112><A name=112>In the present case, the courts have been urged to 
  extend by a process of liberal interpretation the concept of family to cover 
  homosexual relationships and relationships of close long lasting friendship. 
  It is submitted that the usage of the word "family" may vary from time to time 
  and that it has no constant meaning: that accordingly it should now in 1999 be 
  given an up-to-date meaning: that spouse includes a homosexual relationship 
  "akin" to marriage: that immigration law has recently been revised to take 
  account of such relationships. This type of argument and its proper limits 
  were considered in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in <I>Royal College of 
  Nursing v. D.H.S.S.</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html">[1981] AC 800</a></a> at 822, to which we were referred by 
  Mr Blake QC who appeared for Mr Fitzpatrick on this appeal. Lord Wilberforce 
  said: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"In interpreting an Act of Parliament it is proper, and 
    indeed necessary, to have regard to the state of affairs existing, and known 
    by Parliament to be existing, at the time. It is a fair assumption that 
    Parliament's policy or intention is directed to that state of affairs. . . . 
    When a new state of affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on policy, 
    comes into existence, the courts have to consider whether they fall within 
    the Parliamentary intention. They may be held to do so, if they fall within 
    the same genus of facts as those to which the expressed policy has been 
    formulated. They may also be held to do so if there can be detected a clear 
    purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled if the extension is 
    made. . . . In any event there is one course which the courts cannot take, 
    under the law of this country; they cannot fill gaps; they cannot by asking 
    the question "What would Parliament have done in this current case--not 
    being one in contemplation--if the facts had been before it?" attempt 
    themselves to supply the answer, if the answer is not to be found in the 
    terms of the Act itself." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=113><A name=113>Applying this to the present case, the relevant Act 
  was passed in 1977 and has been amended since. On any view it is difficult to 
  see what fresh set of facts has since come into existence. Homosexual 
  relationships have been known about and existed throughout any relevant period 
  of time and homosexual couples have shared accommodation. Not much has 
  changed; the highest that it can be put is that the public attitude to such 
  relationships has changed. This has nothing to do with any social policy 
  concerning statutory tenancies by succession. If, contrary to what I have just 
  said, it does have relevance, it is a matter for Parliament to consider not 
  for the courts to ask themselves: 'What would Parliament do now?' But even 
  then one has to take into account that this legislative scheme was amended as 
  recently as 1988. What Parliament then chose to do was to amend paragraph 2 of 
  the Schedule in terms which, as I will explain, are directly contrary to the 
  main submission of the Appellant and affirm the necessarily heterosexual 
  nature of the relevant relationship. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=114><A name=114>In the Court of Appeal, Waite and Roch LJJ declined 
  the invitation to adopt an extended interpretation of the statute: [1998] Ch. 
  304 at pp.318-319 and 324. I would happily quote what Waite LJ said in full 
  but as it is already set out in the published reports will refrain from doing 
  so. Waite LJ expressly accepted the criticisms of the Act but then went on to 
  refer to some of the difficult policy decisions which would have to be made if 
  the Act was to be revised to give effect to these criticisms. He asked: "If 
  succession rights are to be extended to couples of the same sex in a sexually 
  based relationship, would it be right to continue to exclude friends?" He 
  concluded that: </TD></TR></A><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR><TD>
  <UL>&nbsp;"Few would support the potential for unfairness involved in a law 
    which gives automatic succession rights to wives, however faithless, and 
    children, however feckless, and at the same time denies any hope of 
    succession to friends, however devoted their loyalty to the joint household. 
    The judge was nevertheless right, in my view, to resist the temptation to 
    change a bad law by giving it a new linguistic twist. He correctly 
    acknowledged that such changes could only be made by Parliament." </UL>
  <P>I consider that Waite and Roch LJJ were, like the Judge, right to resist 
  the temptation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=115><A name=115>But Ward LJ. was unable to do so. He, by contrast, 
  felt at liberty to give effect to his own views and to make his own value 
  judgments as to the appropriate treatment of homosexual relationships having 
  regard to the changes in social attitudes. He also felt that he was entitled 
  to refer to and take into account parliamentary debates and other material 
  subsequent to 1980 notwithstanding that no warrant for such an approach was 
  given by <I>Pepper v. Hart</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/3.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/3.html">[1993] AC 593</a></a> nor by any accepted canon of 
  construction of statutes. His judgment serves to reinforce the correctness, 
  and wisdom, of what was said by the majority. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=116><A name=116>No argument has been advanced in the present case 
  based upon any submission that the legislation is improperly discriminatory. 
  Such questions may arise hereafter but the arguments in the present case are 
  based solely upon submissions as to the correct construction of the statute as 
  amended. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=117><A name=117>As regards the first way in which Mr Fitzpatrick 
  puts his case--that he was Mr Thompson's "spouse" or was living with Mr 
  Thompson "as his or her wife or husband"--I agree with what has already been 
  said by your Lordships. They were living together as a homosexual couple. 
  <I>Harrogate B.C. v. Simpson</I> (1984) 17 H.L.R. 205, where the Court of 
  Appeal had to consider the parallel provisions in Part IV of the Housing Act 
  1980, was rightly decided and remains good law. To accept the submission of Mr 
  Fitzpatrick would be an exercise of legislation, not interpretation. I 
  therefore need not say more about the argument which Mr Fitzpatrick put in the 
  forefront of his case on this appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=118><A name=118>I must however say something more about paragraph 2 
  since, as already observed, it has been preceded by different provisions. The 
  1977 Rent Act and its predecessors used the word "widow". The Housing Act 1980 
  amended the right to succession to cover surviving spouses; ie it was extended 
  to widows and widowers. The gender distinction was removed. Then in 1988, it 
  was amended again to cover a person living with the tenant as his or her wife 
  or husband. This extension brought in <I>de facto</I> relationships and 
  removed the requirement that the parties should have been legally married. It 
  thus subsumed the decision of the Court of Appeal in <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd. v. 
  Fox</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/8.html">[1976] QB 503</a></a>. But it still required a heterosexual relationship 
  equivalent to marriage. Parliament did not go so far as to extend the 
  provision to homosexual relationships akin to marriage nor to friendships, 
  however close or long lasting, not accompanied by the additional factor of 
  living together as husband and wife. The criterion of as "husband and wife" 
  was retained and confirmed. (See also <I>In re the Estate of John Watson 
  (Deceased),</I> The Times, 31 December 1998, cited by Mr Blake, where 
  Neuberger J used reasoning wholly inconsistent with extending the category 
  beyond heterosexual relationships.) </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=119><A name=119>The policy disclosed by the 1988 revision is thus to 
  recognise factual as well as legal relationships but to continue to require 
  that they correspond to the heterosexual concept of legal marriage. This 
  policy appears to adopt and conform to the decision and statements of 
  principle in the speech some years earlier of Lord Diplock (agreed to by the 
  other members of the House) in <I>Carega Properties v. Sharratt</I> [1979] 1 
  W.L.R. 928, to which I will come shortly. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=120><A name=120>As will already be apparent from my reference to 
  Part IV of the Housing Act 1980 and the <I>Harrogate B.C</I> case, there were 
  precedents for the type of language used for the 1988 amendment. Another was 
  the first Schedule to the Supplementary Benefits Act 1976. In the case 
  <I>Crake v. Supplementary Benefits Commission</I> [1982] 1 All E.R. 498, Woolf 
  J had to consider that Schedule and whether the relevant person was living 
  with the applicant as husband and wife. The facts were that the man was a 
  longstanding friend of the applicant who, after she had been seriously injured 
  in a road accident and her daughter was no longer able to look after her, 
  moved in to her home and lived there, looking after her and the house, indeed 
  doing all the things that a husband would do for a sick wife. It was not a 
  commercial arrangement. But they had no sexual relationship; they were not 
  living as husband and wife. Therefore the claim to the supplementary allowance 
  failed. The functional argument was rejected. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=121><A name=121>Turning now to paragraph 3, it covers (and gives 
  certain limited rights to) a person who does not come within paragraph 2 but 
  is a member of the tenant's family. Following through the policy of the 
  legislation, this extension covers those who are in a legal or <I>de facto</I> 
  relationship to the tenant of blood or affinity. The legal relationships are 
  thus the parents and grandparents, the issue, natural and adopted, of the 
  tenant or of his or her spouse, their respective siblings, nephews and nieces 
  and the spouses of such persons. The factual relationships are the 
  same--informally adopted children and (usually) children for whom the tenant 
  has parental responsibility--and persons with whom the tenant would have had a 
  relationship of affinity if the tenant was legally married to the person with 
  whom he or she is living as his or her husband or wife. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=122><A name=122>But, for the purposes of paragraph 3, the 
  relationship, whether of blood or affinity, must be an actual one. The person 
  must actually be a member of the tenant's family; it is not enough that he or 
  she be living with the tenant <I>as if</I> he or she was a member of the 
  tenant's family. (<I>Sefton Holdings Ltd. v. Cairns</I> (1987) 20 H.L.R. 124) 
  This is not in dispute. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=123><A name=123>In <I>Carega</I>, the defendant whom the landlord 
  was seeking to dispossess was in no blood relationship to the deceased tenant, 
  an elderly widow with whom he had gone to live 18 years earlier. Their 
  relationship was one of close friendship, platonic and filial. He had been 24 
  when he first came to know her. She would have liked to speak of him as her 
  son but this was not acceptable to him because his mother was still alive. He 
  therefore called her Aunt Nora. He was financially independent of her; his 
  motive during the 18 years he lived with her in her flat was simply kindness 
  and affection. The County Court judge had decided in favour of the defendant 
  on the ground that he was a member of her family. The Court of Appeal reversed 
  that decision. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=124><A name=124>In the House of Lords, Lord Diplock opened his 
  speech by saying: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lords, the only question in this appeal is one of 
    construction of the Rent Act 1968. It is whether a person between whom and 
    the deceased statutory tenant of a dwelling house there is no connection by 
    way of consanguinity, of affinity, of adoption (de jure or de facto) during 
    minority or of regular sexual intercourse (past or present) can be a member 
    of the tenant's family within the meaning of Schedule 1, paragraph 3 to the 
    Act, so as to entitle him to become the statutory tenant of the dwelling 
    house by succession to the deceased." </UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=125><A name=125>Lord Diplock is thus listing the established 
  parameters of the concept of family and saying that the House has to decide 
  whether they should be extended. He refers to two <I>de facto</I> categories: 
  that which arises from adopting a child during its minority and that which 
  arises from regular sexual intercourse past or present. This last category has 
  now been subsumed into living "as his or her wife or husband". A sexual 
  relationship not amounting to living together as husband and wife will not 
  suffice but living together as husband and wife will suffice even if the 
  parties choose not to have sexual intercourse (as may also be the case in a 
  legal marriage). Lord Diplock declined to enter upon a discussion of the 
  correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <I>Dyson Holdings Ltd.

  Mackay</I>, 1947 S.C. 287) But these opinions were clearly wrong and cannot be 
  sustained; they would amount to substituting a judicial policy for that 
  contained in the legislation. They cannot now be supported nor did the 
  Appellant seek to do so. They are clearly inconsistent with later and superior 
  authority. See, for example, <I>Ross v. Collins</I> [1964] 1 W.L.R. 425, where 
  a devoted housekeeper of many years standing was held to be not entitled to 
  succeed to the tenancy: "there was no family relationship of any kind". 
  (p.430, per Pearson LJ) </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=128><A name=128>The word "family" is as has often been said not a 
  term of art but describes a unit which has the familial characteristics. One 
  such characteristic is the existence of blood relationships. Thus, in <I>Hawes 
  v. Evenden</I> [1953] 1 W.L.R. 1169, a group which consisted of the tenant, 
  his mistress of some 12 years and their two children was easily recognised as 
  being a family. (<I>cf Gammans v. Ekins</I> [1950] 2 K.B. 328.) In <I>Brock v. 
  Wollams</I> [1949] 2 K.B. 388, a woman, who had at the age of 5 in 1912 been 
  informally adopted by the tenant and brought up as his daughter and who 
  returned later in her life (after her husband had died) to live with the 
  tenant, was held to be a member of his family, even though not a blood 
  relation. It was his <I>de facto</I> adoption of her whilst a child that made 
  her a part of his family. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=129><A name=129>The limits upon the ambit of the word family were 
  most forcefully expressed in the case of <I>Gammans</I> (<I>sup</I>). A 
  childless couple were living together as man and wife but they had not 
  married. The woman was not part of the man's family. Asquith LJ using language 
  which would scarcely be acceptable today unequivocally rejected the idea that 
  mere friendship or a sexual relationship between two people of the same or a 
  different sex could amount a family. He and the other members of the Court of 
  Appeal affirmed that the concept of family must involve blood or affinity. The 
  only exception was relationships whereby one person becomes <I>in loco 
  parentis</I> to another, <I>eg</I> <I>Brock v. Wollams</I> (<I>sup</I>). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=130><A name=130>Returning to the speech of Lord Diplock in 
  <I>Carega</I>, he left open the questions raised by the case of <I>Dyson v. 
  Fox</I> (p.930). As I have already observed, the legislature has, by the 
  amendments which it has chosen to make to the 1977 Act, already addressed the 
  implications of that decision. Lord Diplock's <I>ratio decidendi</I> follows 
  on a reference to the cases <I>Gammans v. Ekins</I> and <I>Ross v. 
  Collins</I>. Lord Diplock chose to adopt as his own what was said by Russell 
  LJ in the second of those cases: 
  <UL>&nbsp;"Granted that 'family' is not limited to cases of a strict legal 
    familial nexus, I cannot agree that it extends to a case such as this. It 
    still requires, it seems to me, at least a broadly recognisable <I>de 
    facto</I> familial nexus. This may be capable of being found and recognised 
    as such by the ordinary man-where the link would be strictly familial had 
    there been a marriage, or where the link is through adoption of a minor, de 
    jure or de facto, or where the link is 'step-,' or where the link is 
    'in-law' or by marriage. But two strangers cannot, it seems to me, ever 
    establish artificially for the purposes of this section a familial nexus by 
    acting as brothers or as sisters, even if they call each other such and 
    consider their relationship to be tantamount to that. Nor, in my view, can 
    an adult man and woman who establish a platonic relationship establish a 
    familial nexus by acting as a devoted brother and sister or father and 
    daughter would act, even if they address each other as such and even if they 
    refer to each other as such and regard their association as tantamount to 
    such. Nor, in my view, would they indeed be recognised as familial links by 
    the ordinary man." </UL>
  <P>This <I>ratio decidendi</I> is binding upon your Lordships. It is 
  inconsistent with the arguments of Mr Fitzpatrick. Living together as 
  homosexual lovers is not a familial relationship. It is a different 
  relationship: for present purposes, as counsel said, no better and no 
  worse--no less or more meritorious, just different. At one stage of his 
  submissions Mr Blake expressly disavowed any reliance upon the existence of 
  sexual relations between Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Thompson. But Mr Blake would 
  have been wrong to abandon, if this was what he was doing, this plank of his 
  case. Absent a sexual relationship, the relationship would have been no more 
  than one of caring friendship which on any view does not suffice. He has to be 
  able to say that the existence of a (formerly active) homosexual relationship 
  makes all the difference. Stripped of that feature he cannot, on the English 
  authorities, succeed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=131><A name=131>It is understandable why Mr Blake shrank from 
  putting his client's case in that way. It would expose the degree of the 
  extension of the previous authorities for which he has to contend and points 
  up the lack of support for his argument in the drafting of paragraphs 2 and 3 
  of the Schedule. If Parliament had wished to take this further radical step, 
  extending the rights of succession to protected tenancies, it would have given 
  some hint of its intention in the amendments which it made after 1977. It has 
  manifested no such intention. The <I>Dyson</I> decision has been recognised by 
  the Legislature in its amendment of paragraph 2. The argument of Mr Blake 
  would seem to treat as family two persons of the opposite sex living together 
  in the same flat or house who have or have had a long term stable sexual 
  relationship but do not choose to be known as man and wife. Regardless of the 
  reason for their choice, paragraph 2(2) makes it essential that each should be 
  living as the wife or husband of the other. If your Lordships are being asked 
  to say that nevertheless the survivor should still qualify as family under 
  paragraph 3 on the strength of the decision in <I>Dyson</I>, the invitation 
  should in my judgment be rejected. The amendment to paragraph 2 has laid down 
  the relevant criterion which the relationship must satisfy. By a parity of 
  reasoning, the <I>Dyson</I> case does not now provide Mr Fitzpatrick with a 
  route down which he can pass asserting an equivalence between homosexual and 
  heterosexual relationships. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=132><A name=132>The word "family", as I have previously observed, is 
  not a term of art. It is a word which is used to refer to a scheme of 
  relationships having certain characteristics. All those characteristics may 
  not be present in every case; this is the nature of descriptive words. But in 
  any case there must be sufficient of the relevant characteristics to justify 
  the application of the descriptive term. In deciding a legal question it is 
  necessary to decide on which side of the line the individual case falls. This 
  exercise is not one of choosing what social policy to support. It involves 
  looking at the language of the statute construed in its legislative context 
  and having regard to the previous decisions of the courts. The decided 
  authorities have told us what the relevant characteristics are. The 
  legislative context has been made clear by the history of the amendments made. 
  The fundamental difficulty for Mr Fitzpatrick is that he is seeking to 
  establish a legal right against the owners of the property, the Plaintiffs in 
  the action, based upon the advocacy of a social policy which may one day be 
  adopted by the Legislature but which has not yet been incorporated in 
  legislation and which anticipates the essential policy and drafting decisions 
  which would have to be taken by the Legislature. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=133><A name=133>Finally, I should shortly refer to certain legal 
  decisions from other jurisdictions upon which Mr Blake sought to rely. These 
  citations did not assist Mr Fitzpatrick's case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=134><A name=134>Mr Blake strongly relied upon the approach of the 
  Court of Appeals of New York in <I>Braschi v. Stahl Associates</I> (1989) 544 
  N.Y.S. 2d 784. In a similar context, occupancy rights to a rent controlled 
  apartment, the court adopted a broad approach to the application of the word 
  family as being a relationship characterised by emotional and financial 
  commitment and interdependence and not limited to persons connected by blood 
  or law. However, the reasoning of the judgment of Judge Titone shows, 
  unsurprisingly, that the law of New York is inconsistent with decided English 
  cases. At p. 789 of the report, he adopts definitions of "family" from 
  Webster's Dictionary--"a group of people united by certain convictions or 
  common affiliation"--and from Black's Law Dictionary--"the collective body of 
  persons who live in one house and under one head or management". By such 
  criteria households of close friends are to be treated as families; this is 
  not the law of England nor is it suggested that it is. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=135><A name=135>The other class of citation made by Mr Blake was 
  from decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of 
  Justice. In <I>X, Y &amp; Z v. The United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../../../../eu/cases/ECHR/1997/20.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1997/20.html">(1997) 24 EHRR 143</a></a>, 
  it was alleged that the refusal to register a female to male transsexual ('X') 
  as the father of a child ('Z') born to the woman ('Y') with whom the 
  transsexual was living was a breach of Article 8 of the Convention 
  guaranteeing the right to family life. The child had been conceived by AID 
  from an anonymous donor. The Court recognised that the previous decisions of 
  the Court had not gone so far as to hold that a homosexual relationship was a 
  family relationship: see paragraphs 52 and 53 of the Commission's opinion and 
  paragraph 34 of the judgment and <I>Kerkhoven v. Netherlands</I> (19.5.92). 
  The Court held that there was a family unit in the case before it because of 
  the fact that the couple were living as husband and wife and the presence of 
  the child Z with whom X was living as her father. The Court therefore accepted 
  the applicability of Article 8 but went on to hold that there had been no 
  breach. The reasoning of the judgment is in line with the English law and is 
  inconsistent with Mr Blake's submissions. A homosexual couple living together 
  does not constitute a family. As regards the right to marry (Article 12), the 
  Court has affirmed the heterosexual character of marriage and has refused both 
  under Article 12 and Article 8 to treat same sex couples, even where one is a 
  transsexual, as the same as heterosexual couples. (<I>Sheffield and Horsham v. 
  United Kingdom </I>(1998) 27 E.H.R.R. 163. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=136><A name=136>In <I>Grant v. South West Trains</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1998/C24996.html">3 BHRC 578</a>, 
  the European Court of Justice was concerned with an allegation that 
  concessionary fares granted to heterosexual couples, married or unmarried, was 
  unlawfully discriminatory against homosexual couples. The allegation was 
  rejected because the relationships were not equivalent. The Strasbourg 
  jurisprudence was referred to as well as previous decisions of the ECJ. The 
  Court held: 
  <UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It follows that, in the present state of the law within the 
    Community, stable relationships between two persons of the same sex are not 
    regarded as equivalent to marriages or stable relationships outside marriage 
    between persons of opposite sex." </UL>
  <P>Here again the citation does not assist Mr Fitzpatrick. Indeed it 
  underlines that the developments for which he contends involve developments of 
  policy and fall far outside the proper ambit of statutory construction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=137><A name=137>I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgments 
  of the majority in the Court of Appeal. </LI></OL>
