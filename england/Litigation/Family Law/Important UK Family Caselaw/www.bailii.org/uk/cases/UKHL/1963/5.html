<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In 1961
the Shropshire justices made an order that the Respondent be<BR>no
longer bound to cohabit with the Appellant, her husband. This order
was<BR>made because the justices found that he had been guilty of
persistent cruelty<BR>to her. On appeal a Divisional Court (Sir
Jocelyn Simon, P. and Cairns, J.)<BR>made an extensive and valuable
analysis of the authorities and held, chiefly<BR>on the authority of
<I>Kaslefsky </I>v. <I>Kaslefsky </I>[1951] P. 38 and <I>Eastland
</I>v.<BR><I>Eastland </I>[1954] P. 403, that the facts proved did
not amount to cruelty. Their<BR>decision was reversed by the Court of
Appeal (Willmer and Davies, LJJ.,<BR>Harman, L.J. dissenting).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">We have
before us notes of evidence given before the Ludlow justices<BR>and a
note of their reasons. Both are admirably prepared, but they
cannot<BR>be a full equivalent of a transcript of evidence and a
judgment in the High<BR>Court. So it is even more necessary for us to
be cautious in attempting<BR>to substitute a different view of the
facts from that taken by the justices. In<BR>this case I think I
might have taken a different view of some of the facts<BR>but I do
not find any sufficient grounds for rejecting the view of the
justices:<BR>it may well be that if I had seen the witnesses and
heard the whole<BR>of the evidence I would have agreed with them. So
I shall state briefly<BR>the facts as they appear to have presented
themselves to the justices.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
parties were married in 1946. They were then aged 43 and 38.
There<BR>are two daughters born in 1947 and 1949. The husband owned a
farm<BR>but he was unsuccessful and ran into debt. He sold the farm
in 1957 and<BR>bought a house at Church Stretton. His wife had given
or lent to him<BR>considerable sums and he transferred the house to
her. The wife has carried<BR>on the house as a guest house for
elderly people. The husband did little<BR>or nothing to help her in
running the house: if he had chosen to do so<BR>he could have
obtained paid employment but he did not do so. He spent<BR>a good
deal of time and money in trying to invent agricultural
machinery,<BR>but the justices appear to have regarded this as a mere
excuse or as a<BR>selfish indulgence. He was incorrigibly and
inexcusably lazy, and that has<BR>been at the root of the whole
trouble. She was an active and capable<BR>woman and with little
assistance she earned some &pound;25 per week from the<BR>guest
house, but this was little more than enough to meet expenses. I
accept<BR>the view of Harman, L.J. that &quot; all that he had done
is to hang up his hat<BR>&quot; in the hall&quot;. He was being
constantly dunned by creditors. She was<BR>alleged to be liable for
some of his debts&mdash;it is not clear why. But certainly<BR>creditors
were trying to make her pay and she did pay some of the debts.</FONT></FONT></P>

never any suggestion that he was deliberately trying to hurt<BR>her

her<BR>husband was arrogant and bigoted and not a mild man and did
not think<BR>of anyone else but himself.    But the evidence shows
that what worried<BR>her and made her ill was his refusal to try to
help her or to earn money<BR>and clear off his debts.   She says: &quot;
Many times people have come to the<BR>&quot; door seeking my husband
because of long standing debts and also the<BR>&quot; County Court
bailiff has been to the door many years.   This has worried<BR>&quot;
me to death and I cannot stand any more of it&quot;.   It would seem
that<BR>she would have been quite content if she could have put him
out of the<BR>house and continued to maintain herself and her
children without being<BR>troubled by him and his creditors.   She
did refuse to cook for him or do<BR>anything for him and he left for
a time but came back again.   First she<BR>tried to get a

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">So we have
a normal, active and capable woman against whom nothing<BR>is said
brought to a state of health when she can no longer earn her
living<BR>or maintain her children solely by the shiftless and
selfish conduct of her<BR>husband. We must take it that the justices
found that he was well aware<BR>that his conduct was reducing her to
a physical and mental state where<BR>she would no longer be able to
maintain herself or their children, that if<BR>he had chosen to
behave as any decent minded man would this could easily<BR>have been
avoided, but that in spite of his awareness of the consequences<BR>he
chose to continue to sponge on her in selfish idleness. The question
is<BR>whether the law of England requires that these two shall
continue to live<BR>together and would regard her as guilty of the
matrimonial offence of deser-<BR>tion if she left him. If that is the
law, then she must be told that it is her<BR>legal duty as a wife to
sink into poverty and ill health and become with her<BR>children a
charge on the State. But does the law not permit us to say that<BR>such
conduct in such circumstances amounts to persistent cruelty?</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">No one has
ever attempted to give a comprehensive definition of cruelty,<BR>and
I do not intend to try to do so. Much must depend on the
knowledge<BR>and intention of the respondent, on the nature of his
(or her) conduct, and<BR>on the character and physical or mental
weaknesses of the spouses, and<BR>probably no general statement is
equally applicable in all cases except the<BR>requirement that the
party seeking relief must show actual or probable<BR>injury to life,
limb or health. So I shall first exclude the kinds of case<BR>with
which I am not dealing, with the caveat that much of what I am
going<BR>to say may not apply to them. First I exclude cases where
the respondent<BR>acted with a desire or intention to hurt. That kind
of case was dealt with<BR>in <I>Jamieson </I>v. <I>Jamieson </I>[1952]
A.C. 525, and I need say no more than that<BR>if one spouse sets out
to hurt the other and causes injury to health the<BR>means whereby
that happens can hardly matter. Then there are difficult<BR>cases
where the conduct complained of would have caused no damage<BR>to a
spouse normal in health and temperament, but that does not arise<BR>here
because this wife was a normal, healthy woman. And there are
other<BR>cases where the offending spouse suffers from some mental
abnormality.<BR>The next case which we have to decide, <I>Williams </I>v.
<I>Williams, </I>is such<BR>a case, and I shall not anticipate what I
have to say there. With such cases<BR>I associate cases where the
offending spouse is too stupid or obtuse to realise<BR>the effect
which his conduct is having on his wife or her husband. In
the<BR>present case there is nothing in the husband's condition to
palliate his<BR>conduct and he must be regarded as fully responsible
for it. And no question<BR>arises here of the guilty spouse having
been provoked in any way.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This
appears to me to be a plain, uncomplicated case of a husband
fully<BR>responsible for his conduct, knowing that it was injuring
his wife's health<BR>and yet persisting in it, not because he wished
or intended to injure her but<BR>because he was so selfish and lazy
in his habits that he closed his mind to<BR>the consequences. The
facts of this case appear to me to go well beyond<BR>the ordinary
wear and tear of married life&mdash;adopting Lord Asquith's phrase<BR>in
<I>Buchler </I>v. <I>Buchler </I>[1947] P. 25. So the question must
be whether the<BR>husband's conduct was of a kind which can in law be
called cruel and<BR>whether the law requires an intention to injure
before there can be cruelty.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.08cm; text-indent: 0.43cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I shall
not make any extensive examination of the authorities now. I<BR>intend
to look at a good many in <I>Williams's </I>case and I understand
that others<BR>of your Lordships will do so in this case. Sometimes a
distinction is drawn<BR>between conduct which is and conduct which is
not cruel in itself. That<BR>distinction has some validity. Where,
for example, there is physical violence<BR>of a grave and weighty
kind there is no need to look further, as I shall try to<BR>show in
dealing with <I>Williams's </I>case. But more often the conduct must
take<BR>its colour from the state of mind which lay behind it.
Sometimes it is said<BR>that the matter can be left at large: that
although you cannot define cruelty<BR>you can recognise it when you
see it: and that therefore the trial judge<BR>should not be hampered
by legal niceties and refinements. But that appears<BR>to me to be
placing too great a burden on the trial judge and to be likely<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Nevertheless,
I would try to reduce tests, rules and presumptions to a<BR>minimum.
A judge does and must try to read the minds of the parties in<BR>order
to evaluate their conduct. In matrimonial cases we are not
concerned<BR>with the reasonable man as we are in cases of
negligence. We are dealing<BR>with this man and this woman and the
fewer <I>a priori </I>assumptions we make<BR>about them the better.
In cruelty cases one can hardly ever even start<BR>with a presumption
that the parties are reasonable people because it is hard<BR>to
imagine any cruelty case ever arising if both the spouses think and
behave<BR>as reasonable people.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In the
present case I think that the Divisional Court went wrong
because<BR>they proceeded on the authority of <I>Kaslefsky's </I>case.
They are in no way to<BR>blame for that because they were bound to
follow it. But I do not regard<BR><I>Kaslefsky's </I>case as a good
guide, so I must now examine it and its implica-<BR>tions. As was
inevitable in the existing state of the law, that case was<BR>argued
and decided in an atmosphere of phrases and presumptions
more<BR>picturesque than of easy practical application. The trouble
began in a way<BR>which was not uncommon. The husband after the birth
of his son went<BR>abroad for two and a half years on war service.
While he was away the<BR>wife told him she wanted her freedom. She
and the child were living with<BR>her mother and he returned to her
there in April, 1946. She was lazy and<BR>sluttish and left much of
the care of the child to her mother and then to her<BR>husband. She
refused sexual intercourse and there were some quarrels<BR>about the
child ; and after a couple of years he met another woman and went<BR>off
with her. Then he tried to get a divorce for cruelty. There was
some<BR>evidence of injury to his health, but it was not clear that
that was really<BR>caused by his wife's conduct. There was nothing to
shew that she knew<BR>or must have known that her conduct was
injuring his health, or that the<BR>real cause of his leaving her was
that he could not stand her conduct any<BR>longer. There was some
evidence of failure to treat the child properly but<BR>nothing that I
would regard as cruelty. On any view of the law I would<BR>think that
cruelty had not been proved.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The case
was decided by the learned Commissioner on the ground that<BR>there
was &quot; no evidence before me that those acts were what are called
inten-<BR>&quot; tional acts or aimed specifically at the husband &quot;.
In the Court of Appeal<BR>the eminent Counsel engaged could not do
other than take the familiar line:<BR>&quot; The husband's health was
not injured merely by the natural development of<BR>&quot; the wife's
character but by her wilful and unjustifiable conduct towards<BR>&quot;
him ... a spouse must be presumed to intend the natural and
probable<BR>&quot; consequences of his or her own acts ... it is not
necessary ... to prove that<BR>&quot; the respondent intended to be
cruel, provided that her intentional acts<BR>&quot; amounted in fact
to cruelty &quot;; and then they argued that the test of &quot; in<BR>&quot;

L.J., with whom Somervell L.J. agreed, said (at p. 44): &quot; I
venture<BR>&quot; to think that that is one of the tests which has to
be applied: is the conduct<BR>&quot; of the wife, unless done for the
express purpose of injuring the health of the<BR>&quot; husband,
innocent in the sense that it is justified or justifiable under the<BR>&quot;
circumstances? In cases such as refusal of sexual intercourse, or
sheer<BR>&quot; laziness, or neglect of a child, I think that is
conduct which is innocent, so<BR>&quot; far as any charge of cruelty
is concerned, unless it is done for the express<BR>&quot; purpose of
causing injury to the health of the complaining spouse &quot;.
That<BR>appears to me to go much too far, but I need not develop the
point because<BR>in the next paragraph he appears to me to have
watered it down by agreeing<BR>with what Denning L.J. had said in
<I>Westall: </I>&quot;... intention is an element in<BR>&quot; this

may readily be inferred from the fact that it is the natural<BR>&quot;

been<BR>&quot; brought to his notice what the consequences will be,
and nevertheless he<BR>&quot; does it, careless and indifferent

temptation if I had<BR>&quot; really tried. But my conduct is
innocent because I had not the slightest<BR>&quot; desire or
intention to harm my wife. I have acted throughout from pure<BR>&quot;
selfishness &quot;. And the evidence may make it quite clear that he
had no<BR>intention at all of causing pain to his wife. If he knew,

intention matter? As I have said, I am not dealing<BR>with cases
where the wife from illness or temperament cannot stand what<BR>an
ordinary woman could be expected to tolerate, or where for any
reason<BR>the husband's responsibility is diminished. I am dealing

a state of mind. You<BR>cannot see into other people's minds but
ordinary people have little difficulty<BR>in inferring intention from
what a man does and says viewed in light of the<BR>circumstances.

literally,<BR>must mean that it would be irrelevant to prove that in
fact he did not intend<BR>that result: it would introduce a purely
objective standard not depending<BR>at all on the state of his mind.
In fact people often intend something<BR>quite different from what
they know to be the natural and probable result<BR>of what they are
doing. To take a trivial example, if I say I intend to<BR>reach the
green people will believe me although we all know that the<BR>odds

law of tort in facilitating the<BR>change from a subjective to an
objective standard. For a long time it<BR>was thought that, at least
in theory, intention or mental state of some kind<BR>was a necessary
ingredient in negligence. But life would be impossible<BR>in modern
conditions unless on the highway and in the market place we<BR>were

we now apply a purely objective standard. The other man may have<BR>been

most often said is that there is a presumption in cruelty cases<BR>that
the respondent intended the natural and probable results of his
conduct,<BR>but that that presumption can be rebutted. That is
equivalent to saying<BR>that proof of the natural and probable
consequences transfers the onus<BR>of proof so that now the
respondent must prove that he did not intend that<BR>result. I
suppose that on this theory the respondent would have to
produce<BR>evidence, including his own, sufficient to shew that on a
balance of probability<BR>he did not intend harm to the petitioner,
and of course it might be more<BR>difficult to prove that he did not
intend a likely result than to prove that<BR>he did not intend an
unlikely result, but quite often he could prove it. A<BR>person
accused does not have to prove his defence beyond reasonable doubt.<BR>I
think that Lord Denning must have had something of this kind in
mind<BR>when he said that such an intention &quot; may readily be
inferred &quot;. But in<BR>many authorities the objective test seems
to persist. In the present case<BR>Willmer, L.J. stated the
propositions of law which he deduced from the<BR>decided cases. He
said &quot; there must always be some element of intention<BR>&quot;
in relation to the impact of the conduct complained of in the other<BR>&quot;
spouse . . . such an intention may in a proper case be inferred
where,<BR>'' for instance, the conduct complained of is persisted in
... in circumstances<BR>&quot; in which any reasonable person would
appreciate that it was likely to<BR>&quot; injure the other spouse.
For any spouse may be presumed to intend the<BR>&quot; natural
consequences of his own behaviour &quot;. That seems to me to be<BR>very
vague. I do not blame Willmer, L.J. because he was trying to sum
up<BR>the authorities and it is impossible to reconcile a good deal
of what has been<BR>said in the various decisions. But what is &quot;
a proper case &quot; and when<BR>&quot; may &quot; the presumption be
applied? This is as vague as &quot; in some way<BR>&quot; aimed at &quot;

attribute to him an intention which he did not have, we base
ourselves<BR>on a fiction and that is bound to lead to trouble.
However useful fictions<BR>may have been in the past in other

confusing in this realm of cruelty. I must pay this tribute<BR>to
learned judges in recent years: in spite of the difficulties created
by all<BR>these artificial tests, there are very few reported cases
where they have not<BR>been circumvented when justice required that.
Indeed, the only decision<BR>cited to us which on a more direct

<I>Eastland </I>[1954] P. 403, where the test in <I>Kaslefsky<BR></I>was

agreed single judgment and such judgments<BR>are not infrequently
obscure. The husband was undoubtedly cruel. But<BR>cruelty was not a
ground of divorce in Victoria and it was necessary to<BR>establish
constructive desertion. The Act required that &quot; the respondent
has<BR>&quot; without just cause or excuse wilfully deserted the
petitioner &quot;. So the ques-<BR>tion was whether the constructive
desertion was &quot; wilful &quot;&mdash;whether there was<BR><I>animus
deserendi. </I>A great deal was said about intention and
presumption,<BR>but as I read the judgment the facts were quite
simple. The man deliberately<BR>ill-treated his wife. He knew that
this was likely to cause her to leave him<BR>but he desired or hoped
that she would not leave. He did not act with the<BR>intention of
driving her out, but he acted with the knowledge that that was<BR>what
would probably happen. There are references to what a reasonable<BR>man
would have known ; but it is said that this man must have
known,<BR>which I take to mean that it was proper to hold on the
evidence that he did<BR>know. So in the result his desire to keep his
wife or lack of intention to<BR>drive her out was irrelevant. The Act
said nothing about intention: it used<BR>the word &quot; wilful&quot;.
So the decision was that if without just cause or<BR>excuse you
persist in doing things which you know your wife will probably<BR>not
tolerate, and which no ordinary woman would tolerate, and then
she<BR>leaves, you have wilfully deserted her, whatever your desire
or intention<BR>may have been. That seems to me to be in line with
what I am now submit-<BR>ting to your Lordships is the law in cases

and intelligence. She was before her marriage a trained<BR>nurse and,
having regard to her age (namely 39 and 41) at the time when<BR>she

stamina<BR>must have been certainly no less than average. She was
also fortunately<BR>possessed of some private means, though it is
clear that her resources have<BR>now been wholly involved or expended
in relief of her husband's indebted-<BR>ness or its consequences. She
discovered shortly after her marriage that her<BR>husband, then a
farmer, was in fact in grave financial difficulties. His farm<BR>was
sold and the Respondent has since maintained the home not only
for<BR>her husband but for herself and her two children of the
marriage by<BR>carrying on, without any help whatever, financial or
otherwise, from her<BR>husband a guest house for elderly people. In
so doing she has been from<BR>time to time gravely embarrassed by the
claims of the creditors of her<BR>husband, who has never made the
smallest contribution to her home, or to<BR>the maintenance and
up-bringing of the two children ; and it is now indeed<BR>apparent
that, if she is denied the relief which she has claimed, she will
be<BR>incapable of further maintenance of the home for herself and
her children<BR>and, as my noble friend has stated, will &quot; sink

these conclusions of fact are justified) in the words of<BR>Sir
William Scott in the old case of <I>Evans v. Evans </I>(1 Hag. Con.

can be discharged &quot; ; or at least in Lord<BR>Normand's language

like my noble friend, Lord Reid, I must not be taken to be<BR>casting
doubt upon the correctness in fact of the decision of the Court
of<BR>Appeal in the <I>Kaslefsky </I>case, but (also like my noble
friend) I am, with all<BR>respect to those who take or have expressed
the opposite opinion, unable<BR>to accept the view that in order to
satisfy a charge of cruelty in a matri-<BR>monial cause it must be
shown that the conduct of the spouse charged was<BR>in some real
sense &quot;aimed at&quot; the other party to the marriage. Such
a<BR>view has, as I understand, emerged from the premise that &quot;
cruelty &quot; in<BR>matrimonial contests involves essentially a
quality of malignity in some sense<BR>on the part of the spouse
charged. Upon this premise appears to have<BR>depended, naturally
enough, that there must have been some intention to<BR>injure the
other party, in other words that the conduct of the party
charged<BR>(whether positive or active on the one hand or, upon the
other, indifferent,<BR>selfish or negative) must in some sense have
been &quot; aimed at&quot; the other<BR>spouse. My Lords, for reasons
which I more fully give in my Opinion in<BR>the case of <I>Williams
</I>v. <I>Williams, </I>I am unable to accept the premise that<BR>&quot;
cruelty &quot; in matrimonial proceedings requires or involves of
necessity the<BR>element of malignity&mdash;though I do not, of
course, doubt that if malignity<BR>be in fact established it would be
highly relevant to a charge of cruelty. In<BR>my opinion, however,
the question whether one party to a marriage has<BR>been guilty of
cruelty to the other or has treated the other with cruelty<BR>does
not, according to the ordinary sense of the language used by
Parliament,<BR>involve the presence of malignity (or its equivalent);
and if this view be<BR>right it follows, as I venture to think, that
the presence of intention to<BR>injure on the part of the spouse
charged or (which is, as I think, the same<BR>thing) proof that the
conduct of the party charged was &quot; aimed at&quot; the
other<BR>spouse is not an essential requisite for cruelty. The

cruel&quot; according to the ordinary sense of that word, rather than
whether<BR>the party charged was himself or herself a cruel man or
woman. Indeed,<BR>for reasons which I shall more fully state in my
Opinion in the <I>Williams<BR></I>case, the introduction of the
notion of &quot; intention &quot; into the jurisdiction with<BR>which
your Lordships are now concerned has led to no little confusion
and<BR>difficulty which, as I hope, may now be laid to rest. The case
where one<BR>party to a marriage sets out by deliberate means to
injure the other is no<BR>doubt simple; but equally it is, I should
think, relatively rare. More<BR>frequent (and in its effects more
often hurtful and insidious) is such a case<BR>as the present where
the &quot; intention &quot; of the party charged, if it exists
at<BR>all, is no more and no less than an &quot; intention &quot; to
gratify his or her purely<BR>selfish inclinations. So it is that, as
it seems to me, the Courts in adopting<BR>the necessity of &quot;
intention &quot; have, inevitably in the cause of justice, had<BR>to
introduce the notion of presumed intention and thereby to have
intro-<BR>duced into Divorce Law quasi-philosophical difficulties
which have clouded<BR>the law and given to the word &quot; cruelty &quot;
a sense which is not justified by<BR>its ordinary significance.</FONT></FONT></P>

words, that if the reasons<BR>formulated by the magistrates were

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Though a
question as to whether one person has been guilty of
persistent<BR>cruelty to another must ultimately be determined as an
issue of fact, it is<BR>eminently desirable that the approach to the
determination should be guided<BR>by principles of general
application. This is not to say that some precise<BR>definition of
cruelty should, for the purposes of judicial determinations,
be<BR>attempted to be given. It has long been recognised that it
would be unwise<BR>to make any such attempt (see <I>Jamieson v.
Jamieson </I>[1952] A.C.<B> </B>525, 550).<BR>There are, however,
certain conceptions which are basic. Most people have<BR>the same
general ideas in mind when they speak of cruelty or of kindness.<BR>If
someone is giving thought to a question as to whether a person
has<BR>been cruel he will probably first consider what it is that the
person has<BR>done or has omitted to do, and will then decide,
perhaps largely as a<BR>matter of opinion, whether the act or
omission does or does not fall within<BR>his conception of cruelty.
In the administration of the law the matter<BR>cannot be left to be
dealt with on quite such broad lines. Cruelty is a<BR>matrimonial
offence and an allegation of cruelty is a serious one. To be<BR>found
guilty of cruelty involves not only a slur which would be
deeply<BR>wounding to any self-respecting person but also involves
certain specific con-<BR>sequences. The matters complained of as
amounting to cruelty must, there-<BR>fore, extend much beyond the
trivial or the casual. They must be serious<BR>matters. If they were
not they surely could not be the foundation for an<BR>order affecting
the matrimonial relationship. When in 1790 Sir William<BR>Scott (in

of the reported decisions in cruelty cases, so carefully and<BR>usefully
reviewed, if I may respectfully say so, in the judgment of
the<BR>learned President, reveals that difficulties often arise in
those cases where no<BR>positive wish to hurt is apparent and in
those cases where conduct causes<BR>hurt indirectly. In the difficult
spheres covered by such cases there has<BR>naturally been a desire to
seek a principle and in this search dependence<BR>has often been
placed upon particular phrases employed by learned judges<BR>in
expressing their conclusions in particular cases. In the result it
has<BR>sometimes happened that a phrase or an aphorism coined in one
case has<BR>become doctrine in the next. My Lords, I would favour as
much simplicity<BR>as is reasonably possible and as much freedom as
is reasonably possible<BR>from any limiting words or phrases. As
Harman, L.J., pointed out in his<BR>judgment, the only question which
in the end arises for decision is&mdash;Did<BR>the conduct of this
husband amount to cruelty to this wife?</FONT></FONT></P>

or which is in relation to or which is in respect of the other

meaning. Other<BR>and different words would do. If such conduct is
wilful and intentional,<BR>then I would consider it fair that it
should be judged by relation to those<BR>standards to which a
reasonable spouse in all the particular circumstances<BR>of the
particular marriage ought to have conformed. If such conduct
is<BR>wilful and intentional, then there either would be or there
should have<BR>been knowledge of any injurious effects resulting from
it. Some cases<BR>would be covered by the oft-quoted words used in
1919 by Shearman, J.,<BR>in <I>Madden </I>v. <I>Madden:</I>&mdash;&quot;
I do not question . . . that he had no intention<BR>&quot; of being
cruel . . . but ... his intentional acts amounted to cruelty &quot;.
I<BR>agree, therefore, with Willmer, L.J., when he said: &mdash;&quot;
Thus, any course of<BR>&quot; conduct intentionally pursued, provided
it has some impact on the other<BR>&quot; spouse, may in appropriate
circumstances justify a finding of cruelty &quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">There may,
however, be conduct which does not appear to have been<BR>directed to
or towards or to have been conduct in relation to or in respect<BR>of
the other spouse. In such cases it is sometimes said that the &quot;
impact &quot;<BR>of the conduct is not direct. If such conduct was
wilful and intentional<BR>(and satisfied the conditions to which I
earlier referred) cruelty could be<BR>established if there had been
an intention to injure the other spouse or if<BR>with knowledge of
its effect it was persisted in or continued. A continuance<BR>of some
particular conduct after receiving a warning that it was
adversely<BR>affecting the other spouse could amount to cruelty.
Further, the facts and<BR>circumstances might be such that any
reasonable person must have known<BR>that injury to the other spouse
would be the result of the conduct: if so,<BR>the wilful pursuit of
the conduct would by inference involve an intention<BR>to cause the
injury. The process of drawing an inference does not involve<BR>imputing
an intention that did not in fact exist but involves deducing<BR>from
proper material that an intention did exist. If the conduct itself
is<BR>wilful and intentional and if either there is knowledge that it
will probably<BR>harm the petitioner or if, applying the standards of
a reasonable person<BR>in the circumstances of the particular case,
there must have been such<BR>knowledge, then, a charge of cruelty
could be maintained. I say &quot; could &quot;<BR>because in the end
it must be shown as a question of fact that the conduct<BR>is such
that it can properly and rationally be stigmatised by the word<BR>&quot;
cruelty &quot; using that word in its ordinary acceptation.</FONT></FONT></P>

the divergences of view which are revealed in the judgments<BR>in the
Divisional Court and in the Court of Appeal seem to me to
arise<BR>mainly in the application of the law to the facts. The facts
are very clearly<BR>set out in the judgment of the learned President,
and I need not refer to<BR>them in complete detail. My study of them
leads me to the same conclusion<BR>as was reached by the learned
President and Cairns, J., in the Divisional<BR>Court and by Harman,
L.J., in the Court of Appeal. From the time of their<BR>marriage in
1946 until the year 1957 the parties lived at the farm. Though<BR>the
husband farmed unsuccessfully and was considerably in debt and
though<BR>the wife was caused much distress by her discovery in 1947
of the grave<BR>financial situation then existing, there is no
suggestion that the husband<BR>at any time offered any sort of
physical harm to her or that he was in any<BR>way aggressively unkind
to her or that he was in any way intemperate.<BR>Nor does the
evidence show that at any time he had any wish to harm her.<BR>That
has not been suggested. Furthermore the wife was not, in fact, at<BR>any
time short of money. The farm was sold in 1957. The property wa*<BR>then
purchased which thereafter the wife ran as a guest house. The
house<BR>was purchased in his name and there was a mortgage on it.
The mortgage<BR>had been partly redeemed by January, 1961, and in
1960 the house was<BR>handed over to the wife. Undoubtedly she had a
hard and strenuous<BR>and worrying time. She had been involved by her
husband in his debts<BR>and she had continuously to work to support
herself and the children and<BR>to pay mortgage sums. He made no
financial contribution. His help in<BR>regard to the running of the
guest house does not appear to have been at<BR>all adequate. His
activities in seeking to make inventions of agricultural<BR>machinery
did not produce any money for the home. In the enterprise<BR>which
kept the home going he may have been little more than a passenger.<BR>It
was the wife who carried the burdens.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It is easy
to understand that a hard pressed and worried wife would<BR>become
exasperated. In September, 1960, a brother of the husband had a<BR>fire
at his farm in Buckinghamshire and as a result the husband went
there<BR>for a time in order to help. It was while he was there that
the wife wrote<BR>to him and told him that she could not stand the
strain of his debts any<BR>longer and she said: &mdash;&quot; I told
him it grieved me to have to take this step,<BR>&quot; but if he did
not get work and clear himself of debt, after the end of the<BR>&quot;
year I should take the steps I have. I asked him to stay away and
get<BR>&quot; work because I could not stand the strain &quot;. The
husband did not do as<BR>she wished and towards the end of the year
he returned home. The wife's<BR>first summons then followed. That was
in December, 1960. She alleged<BR>wilful neglect by him to provide
reasonable maintenance. Cruelty was<BR>not alleged. In her evidence
at the hearing on the 5th January, 1961, the<BR>wife made no
complaint at all save in regard to money matters. There was<BR>no
suggestion or hint at that time that her health was in any way
affected.<BR>She said: &quot; The only time I have any bother is over
finance &quot;. She did<BR>complain of the fact that although her
husband in the period after September,<BR>1960, had worked as a farm
labourer (earning from &pound;6 to &pound;8 per week)<BR>at his
brother's farm in Buckinghamshire he had not sent any money to her.</FONT></FONT></P>

been incurred and that he<BR>had improved the value of the property.
He further said that during the<BR>previous four years he had applied
for jobs but had only succeeded in<BR>obtaining casual employment for
very short periods. The magistrates told<BR>the husband that he ought

per week) to pay off his previously incurred debts. In April, 1961,
the<BR>wife consulted her doctor. In June, 1961, she ceased to
perform regular<BR>household duties for him or to have any
association with him. In August,<BR>1961, she took out a summons for
the variation of the January order. She<BR>asked for the insertion of
a non-cohabitation clause on the ground that<BR>her husband had
treated her with persistent cruelty. It seems remarkable<BR>that she
should have complained of cruelty at that stage. In the
earlier<BR>period she had her husband's presence and no money from
him: at this<BR>period she was having nothing to do with him and he
was making a payment<BR>(though a very small one) to her. It is true
that he was not fully complying<BR>with the January order and was not
paying the stated amounts, but his<BR>case was that because of his
financial position he could not do so and could<BR>not pay more than
he was doing. In September, 1961, he took out a<BR>cross-summons to
revoke the order of 5th January, 1961, on the ground<BR>that his wife
was in desertion or alternatively on the ground that he was no<BR>longer
guilty of wilful neglect to maintain for the reason that he was
not<BR>(and never had been) in a position to pay the amount ordered.
The<BR>husband in his evidence in October said that he had no reason
to think<BR>that his wife was ill. He did not see the doctor come to
the house. His<BR>wife had given him the impression that she did not
want him. It was<BR>the view of the learned President that the object
of the wife in taking out<BR>her summons in August, 1961, for
variation of the previous order was to<BR>get her husband out of the
house. When the summons and cross-summons<BR>came before the justices
in October, 1961, they inserted a non-cohabitation<BR>clause. They
held that since 1957 he had persistently and wilfully refused<BR>to
undertake paid employment, that worry over this and the debts
had<BR>seriously affected the wife's health, that in September, 1960,
she had told<BR>him that she could no longer stand the strain, that
he should have known<BR>that his conduct was having a serious adverse
effect on her health and that<BR>he must have known that a
continuance in his course of conduct would<BR>have an injurious
effect on his wife's mental health. Though the order of<BR>the
justices in October contains no express finding of cruelty it must,
I<BR>think, be taken that their reason for acceding to the
application for a non-<BR>cohabitation order was that they considered
that the complaint of persistent<BR>cruelty made in August, 1961, was
made out. At the same time they decided<BR>in favour of the husband
to the extent that they reduced the wife's main-<BR>tenance from &pound;3
a week to &pound;1 a week and they deleted the requirement to<BR>pay
&pound;1 a week for each child, and furthermore they remitted the
arrears.</FONT></FONT></P>

been guilty of<BR>persistent cruelty was made out, yet they must have
formed the opinion<BR>that cruelty was proved for otherwise it is not
to be supposed that they<BR>would have made an order the effect of
which was to bar the husband<BR>from his wife's society. Although the

the finding of wilful neglect to maintain,<BR>it is not the practice
so to do for the reasons set out in the judgment of<BR>the Court of

my judgment the history of this provision, the language of the<BR>&quot;
context, the very nature of the protection which the provision gives,
and<BR>&quot; the enactment in <I>(a) </I>that it shall have the
effect of a decree of judicial<BR>&quot; separation on the ground of
cruelty unite in shewing that the discretion<BR>&quot; given by
Parliament to the Court of summary jurisdiction as to the<BR>&quot;
framing of orders under ss. 4 and 5 is not rightly exercised, if
this<BR>&quot; non-cohabitation provision is inserted in the order
made for the wife's<BR>&quot; relief, except where the Court has been
satisfied by evidence, in the<BR>&quot; words of the Act of 1878,
'that the future safety of the wife is in<BR>&quot; ' peril'&quot;.  
 He goes on:  &quot;I do not mean, in saying this, that the<BR>&quot;
non-cohabitation provision ought to be inserted in the order only<BR>&quot;
where the wife has proved the convictions for assault or the
persistent<BR>&quot; cruelty expressly specified in s. 4 of the Act
of 1895.   It is possible that<BR>&quot; a wilful neglect to maintain
may be proved to have been accompanied<BR>&quot; by occasional acts
of dangerous violence, and so justify the inclusion<BR>&quot; in the
order of the non-cohabitation provision.    But I am clearly of<BR>&quot;
opinion that it is neither in accordance with the intention of the<BR>&quot;
Legislature, as appearing in this statute, nor in the interest of
the<BR>&quot; wife or of public morals, that the provision should be
included in an&quot;<BR>&quot; order which is sought for and obtained
solely on the ground of the<BR>&quot;  husband's desertion.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

matrimonial disputes, whether in the Magistrates' Courts or in
the<BR>Divorce Court, the word &quot;cruelty&quot; has the same
connotations. It has a<BR>long history behind it. In 1857 by the
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act<BR>the Divorce Court took over the
jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts with<BR>the added statutory
power to grant decrees of dissolution of marriage. By<BR>section 22
it was bound in all suits other than those for dissolution to act
and<BR>give relief &quot; on principles and rules which in the
opinion of the said Court<BR>&quot; shall be as nearly as may be
conformable to the principles and rules<BR>&quot; on which the
Ecclesiastical Courts have heretofore . . . given relief &quot;
(see<BR>now Judicature Consolidation Act, 1925, sections 32 and 103).
The former<BR>relief by decree <I>a mensa et thoro, </I>of which
cruelty had been a ground, became<BR>relief by a decree for judicial
separation (section 7). And a decree for<BR>judicial separation might
be obtained either by the husband or the wife<BR>&quot; on the ground
of adultery or cruelty or desertion without cause for two<BR>&quot;
years and upwards &quot; (section 16). The Matrimonial Causes Act,
1937, first<BR>empowered the Court to grant a decree of dissolution
on the ground that the<BR>Respondent &quot; has since the celebration
of the marriage treated the petitioner<BR>&quot; with cruelty &quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

discussion of hypothetical cases and because I am of opinion that
actual<BR>&quot; intention to hurt may have in a doubtful case a
decisive importance, and<BR>&quot; that such an intention has been
averred here. Actual intention to hurt is<BR>&quot; a circumstance of
peculiar importance because conduct which is intended<BR>&quot; to
hurt strikes with a sharper edge than conduct which is the
consequence<BR>&quot; of mere obtuseness or indifference.&quot; Those
words are inconsistent with the<BR>view that intention was an
essential element. So, too, Lord Merriman's<BR>opinion. He quoted
with approval (at p. 540) the words of Lord Penzance in<BR><I>Kelly
</I>v. <I>Kelly </I>set out above, and those of Shearman, J. in
<I>Hodden </I>v. <I>Hodden<BR>(supra). </I>My noble and learned
friend, Lord Reid, said (at p. 549). &quot; I do<BR>&quot; not doubt
that there are many cases where cruelty can be established with-<BR>&quot;
out it being necessary to be satisfied by evidence that the defender
had<BR>&quot; such an intention, but I do not intend to decide
anything about such<BR>&quot; cases.&quot; Lord Tucker said (at p.
550): &quot; Every such act must be judged in<BR>&quot; relation to
its attendant circumstances, and the physical or mental con-<BR>&quot;
dition or susceptibilities of the innocent spouse, the intention of
the offend-<BR>&quot; ing spouse and the offender's knowledge of the
actual or probable effect<BR>&quot; of his conduct on the other's
health . . . are all matters which may be<BR>&quot; decisive in
determining on which side of the line a particular act or course<BR>&quot;
of conduct lies.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

excuse for her be-<BR>haviour. Two of their Lordships thought
otherwise. Thus it was a border-<BR>line case which turned on the
extent to which the husband's conduct provided<BR>an excuse to the
wife in the particular facts of the case. It would be wrong<BR>to
read words intended to refer to the particular problem before the
House<BR>as intended to be of universal application, particularly
when the authors of<BR>them disclaimed such an intention. My noble
and learned friend, Lord Reid,<BR>(who was one of the majority)
having described the case as &quot; a narrow and<BR>&quot; difficult

cases where there<BR>&quot; has been physical violence and to cases
of nagging or to cases where there<BR>&quot; has been a deliberate
intention to hurt and to cases where temperament and<BR>&quot;
unfortunate circumstances have caused much of the trouble. But in
cases<BR>&quot; like the present, the wife's conduct must at least be
inexcusable after<BR>&quot;  taking everything into consideration.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

develops to a point at which its acts are cruel, whether

that development of character<BR>is within its own sphere if its
emanations affect and cause injury to the<BR>other spouse. Marriage
by its nature causes one party to be affected by<BR>most of the
reprehensible conduct on the part of the other, and usually it<BR>is

spouses was cruel. It is impossible to give a comprehensive
definition<BR>of cruelty, but when reprehensible conduct or departure
from the normal<BR>standards of conjugal kindness causes injury to
health or an apprehension<BR>of it, it is, I think, cruelty if a
reasonable person, after taking due account<BR>of the temperament and
all the other particular circumstances, would con-<BR>sider that the
conduct complained of is such that this spouse should not be<BR>called
on to endure it The judgments of the Court of Appeal in <I>Hall v.
Hall<BR></I>[1962] All E.R. 518 propounded a similar test in a case
of constructive<BR>desertion, save that in such a case there need be
no injury to health. A<BR>relevant question is whether the conduct is
excusable (per Lord Reid in<BR><I>King </I>v. <I>King </I>[1953] A.C.
at page 145 and Willmer, L.J. in <I>Usmar v. Usmar<BR></I>[1949] P. 1
at page 9, &quot; forgivable in the circumstances &quot;). For there
are two<BR>sides to be considered in a case of cruelty&mdash;from the
Petitioner's side ought<BR>this Petitioner to be called on to endure
the conduct, from the Respondent's<BR>side was this conduct
excusable?</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I agree
with Lord Merriman, whose practice in cases of mental cruelty<BR>was
always to make up his mind first whether there was injury or
appre-<BR>hended injury to health. In the light of that vital fact
the Court has then<BR>to decide whether the sum total of the
reprehensible conduct was cruel.<BR>That depends on whether the
cumulative conduct was sufficiently weighty to<BR>say that from a
reasonable person's point of view after a consideration of<BR>any
excuse which this Respondent might have in the circumstances,
the<BR>conduct is such that this Petitioner ought not to be called on
to endure it.</FONT></FONT></P>

What on paper may seem little more than a series of pinpricks &quot;,
said Lord<BR>Normand in <I>Jamieson </I>v. <I>Jamieson </I>[1952]
A.C. at page 536, &quot; may present a<BR>&quot; very different
aspect when it has been developed in evidence.&quot; The<BR>quality
of every piece of conduct is affected by its context and by
that<BR>which precedes and follows it. And it is to be remembered
that, as my<BR>noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, pointed out in
<I>King </I>v. <I>King </I>[1953] A.C.<BR>124 at page 140, &quot;It
is not right first to ask whether the respondent's<BR>&quot; conduct
was cruel in fact and then to ask whether it can in any way be<BR>&quot;
justified. The question whether the respondent treated her husband
with<BR>&quot; cruelty is a single question only to be answered after
all the facts have<BR>&quot; been taken into account.&quot; And (at
page 138). &quot; In a case of this character<BR>&quot; the wife's
conduct must be judged in the light of the whole history of the<BR>&quot;
marriage &quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It was
suggested by Mr. Latey that we should evolve a formula which<BR>would
exclude such conduct as that of the Appellant from cruelty
unless<BR>there was an intention to hurt, and that then having found
no such intention<BR>we should acquit him of cruelty. But cruelty is
a question of fact and<BR>degree, and no legal formula can resolve
its peculiar problems. It would no<BR>doubt simplify decisions in
accident cases if the law evolved a legal principle<BR>that all
driving over 40 miles per hour is negligent and that no driving
under<BR>that speed could be negligence; but such a principle would
be an evasion of<BR>the Court's duty to decide the question of fact.
So, too, with cruelty cases<BR>which depend on an even wider variety
of matters than negligence cases.<BR>The particular circumstances of
the home, the temperaments and emotions<BR>of both the parties and
their status and their way of life, their past relation-<BR>ship and
almost every circumstance that attends the act or conduct
complained<BR>of may all be relevant. I agree with the words of Lord
Tucker when he<BR>said in <I>Jamieson </I>v. <I>Jamieson </I>[1952]
A.C. at 550: &quot; It is in my view equally<BR>&quot; undesirable&mdash;if
not impossible&mdash;by judicial pronouncement to create<BR>&quot;
certain categories of acts or conduct as having or lacking the nature
or<BR>&quot; quality which render them capable ... of amounting to
cruelty in cases where<BR>&quot; no physical violence is averred.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

seeks to put before us the image of a man who was a good<BR>husband
in all save his incapacity to work or to provide money for the<BR>home.
It is more probable that the justices formed the view that he<BR>was
not merely lazy but callous and selfish. Early in the marriage
he<BR>borrowed her savings and he &quot; involved her in his
financial affairs to her<BR>&quot; detriment&quot;. She was a
competent, stable person and she managed by<BR>hard work in the guest
house to keep the family from want. &quot; Since 1957 the<BR>&quot;
husband, in spite of his wife's pleas for him to do so, has
persistently<BR>&quot; and wilfully refused to undertake paid
employment.&quot; He has subjected<BR>her to constant worry and
anxiety over his debts. Creditors and bailiffs<BR>have come to her
guest house and embarrassed her courageous efforts to<BR>make a
living for the family. He has insisted on remaining on the
premises,<BR>when under the circumstances the wife naturally wanted
him to depart.<BR>'Under the pressure of such a situation the wife
has paid sums to his creditors.<BR>Apparently he has actually gone to
the length of signing her name to a<BR>promissory note in order to
obtain money for his own purposes&mdash;a course<BR>which was
obviously likely to cause her great anxiety. In September, I960,<BR>he
was warned that his wife could no longer stand the strain imposed
by<BR>his behaviour. Moreover, any reasonable man, as the Justices
found, would<BR>have appreciated that his conduct was having a
serious adverse effect on<BR>his wife's health.</FONT></FONT></P>
