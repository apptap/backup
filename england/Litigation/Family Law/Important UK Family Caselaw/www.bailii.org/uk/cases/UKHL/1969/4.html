<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The story
began in the autumn of 1957 when the infant's parents came to<BR>Britain
from Madrid for the purpose of bettering their financial position
by<BR>entering domestic service.   The father was at that time a very
lowly paid<BR>worker living in poor housing conditions in Madrid.  
They are both of the<BR>Roman Catholic faith.   They left behind a
daughter then aged four who lived<BR>with the maternal grandmother.  
The mother became pregnant shortly after<BR>their arrival in Britain
and the infant was born in hospital on 8th May, 1958.<BR>As the
mother was found to be suffering from tuberculosis and had to
remain<BR>in hospital for some considerable time a home was found for
the infant through<BR>the kind offices of a married couple who  have 
been called the  &quot; foster<BR>parents &quot;.   The infant was
taken care of, from the age of four days, by them in<BR>their house
in Northamptonshire  while the mother remained in  hospital.<BR>The
foster parents had been both previously married and between them
have<BR>four children by their previous marriages and now have two by
their own<BR>marriage.    The infant continued to remain with the
foster parents until the<BR>mother was discharged from hospital in
April   1959.    The infant's father<BR>remained in employment near
the foster parents' house and visited the infant<BR>from time to
time.    The infant thereafter rejoined his parents  who had<BR>obtained
employment in Surrey.   The foster parents had also moved to
Surrey.<BR>The infant remained with his parents at Caterham for about
ten months: the<BR>foster mother assisted the mother in looking after
the infant and the parents<BR>kept in touch with the foster parents'
family.  In February, 1960, the mother<BR>again became pregnant.   
As she was afraid of having another baby in this<BR>country she and
her husband went back to Madrid taking the infant with<BR>them.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">During the
infant's stay in Madrid in the summer of 1960 his parents lived<BR>in
what has been described as little better than a &quot; hovel&quot;.
The father was<BR>still a lowly paid worker and the family lived in
what were virtually slum<BR>conditions. In the summer heat of Madrid
the infant's health rapidly<BR>deteriorated due to malnutrition and
the local conditions which did not suit<BR>him. He only remained in
Madrid with his parents for 17 months. In<BR>July, 1961, he returned
to Britain to stay with the foster parents. This move<BR>was made at
the specific request of the parents who, through the intermediary<BR>of
a Spanish maid of the foster parents, Maria, conveyed their request
to the<BR>foster parents. This request was made on the ground of the
infant's health.<BR>On his return to this country the infant's health
rapidly improved and he has<BR>continued thereafter to enjoy good
health. He has not lived with his parents<BR>since July, 1961, and
has continued to live with his foster parents ever since.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
parents were content at this time to leave the infant with the
foster<BR>parents. There was some suggestion that the parents should
return to<BR>England to take up domestic service, so that the infant
could be with them,<BR>and the foster parents in fact made some
arrangements to this end. But<BR>these arrangements came to nothing.
In the winter of 1961 the parents went<BR>to Hamburg with the idea of
further bettering their financial position in<BR>order to be able to
obtain a house of their own in Madrid in more
salubrious<BR>surroundings. They had left their elder daughter with
the maternal grand-<BR>mother in Madrid and they remained in Hamburg
until the early part of<BR>1963. In February, 1963, the grandmother
died and this necessitated the<BR>parents' return to Madrid, first
the mother and latterly the father.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Up to this
point of time the parents had evinced no wish to the foster<BR>parents
to have the infant back with them in Madrid, apart from a
suggestion<BR>for a holiday. But in July, 1963, the foster mother
wrote to the mother<BR>what has been described as a tactless and most
unfortunate letter. In this<BR>letter she described how the infant
had become integrated with their family;<BR>he had gone to an English
school and he had grown up an English boy with<BR>English habits, and
that it would be most disturbing for him to have to return<BR>to live
with his parents in Madrid. She also made critical remarks about
the<BR>infant's father. This letter produced the not unexpected
reaction from the<BR>mother who, after some previous correspondence,
wrote on 25th September,<BR>1963, to the Surrey County Council, in
whose official care the infant was,<BR>asking for the infant's
return. The Local Authority did not act with con-<BR>spicuous
consistency or good sense. After appearing to agree to the
mother's<BR>request they subsequently, after receipt of a letter from
the foster parents<BR>expressing their point of view, resolved, upon
the advice of counsel, to apply<BR>to the Chancery Division to have
the infant made a ward of court, which was<BR>done on 16th December,
1963.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
proceedings took some considerable time to reach the judge and
the<BR>parents were unfortunately led to believe by a letter from the
Surrey County<BR>Council that they would be represented by counsel at
the hearing who would<BR>state their case for them. For this reason
the parents only lodged written<BR>representations, which had been
prepared for them by a Spanish lawyer.<BR>These, however, did express
their wish for the infant's return. Affidavits<BR>were lodged by
various other parties. After a hearing on 22nd July,
1965,<BR>Ungoed-Thomas J. ordered that the infant remain a ward of
court, that<BR>the care and control be committed to the foster
parents, that the infant be<BR>brought up in the Roman Catholic faith
and in the knowledge and recogni-<BR>tion of his parents and in
knowledge of the Spanish language.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Two years
were to elapse before the final stage of the proceedings took<BR>place
before the same judge. This stage had been initiated by the
parents'<BR>summons&mdash;asking that they should have the care and
control of the infant.<BR>This was made on 10th May, 1967. An
application was also made by the<BR>foster parents that the infant be
brought up in the Protestant faith. This<BR>request for a change in
the boy's religious upbringing was prompted by a<BR>desire on the
foster parents' part that he should enter a choir school so<BR>as to
avoid expense. The most convenient school was a Protestant
school.<BR>The Official Solicitor also entered the proceedings,
having been appointed<BR>next friend. On this occasion the judge
heard evidence from all the parties<BR>and his judgment was given on
31st July, 1967. No order was made on<BR>either application and his
order was dated 20th September, 1967. Owing<BR>to various delays, for
which none of the parties is responsible, the Court<BR>of Appeal
hearing did not take place until 5th July, 1968, and the order<BR>of
the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal was made on 30th July,
1968.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
retrospect it is unfortunate that at the first hearing in 1963 before
the<BR>judge the full facts were not before him. It is apparent that
at that stage<BR>he was uncertain of the ability of the mother, on
the ground of her health,<BR>to look after the child and he was not
sure in his own mind that the parents<BR>genuinely desired the
infant's return. It may be that if more expedition had<BR>been
exercised by the parties in bringing the case to trial and the full
facts<BR>had been known at the time, the judge's decision might well
have been<BR>different in 1963. In 1963 when the parents first asked

was only five years old and he had only been parted from his<BR>parents
for a matter of two years. Even in 1965 he was only seven years<BR>old,
but by the time of the second hearing he was nine and a half and<BR>he
is now ten and a half years old. He has been at school in England
since<BR>January, 1963. He has not seen his parents since 1961, when
he was three,<BR>and apart from a matter of twenty seven months he
has been living con-<BR>tinually in the home of the foster parents
with their family. There is no<BR>doubt, as the learned judge found,
that the infant lives in happy surroundings<BR>in a united and well
integrated family. The mixed families have made it<BR>particularly
easy for him to become integrated. He speaks English and<BR>only
pidgin Spanish. He is especially friendly with Piers the child of
the<BR>marriage of the foster parents who is only a little younger
than him.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It is
right at this stage to say that the house in which the parents
now<BR>live in Madrid is entirely suitable for the reception of the
infant. It contains<BR>three bedrooms and is in a modern block of
flats in quite different<BR>surroundings from the previous home. The
father is in good steady employ-<BR>ment at a weekly wage of about
&pound;18 and the mother's health has been<BR>completely restored.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The reason
which has impelled the judge to take the unusual step of<BR>taking
the care and control from the parents and giving it to strangers<BR>is
that, in his view, the risk of plunging this boy of ten and a half
years<BR>into a Spanish family, where he has not seen his parents
since he was aged<BR>three and into a foreign country, would be too
great to take and that the<BR>adjustment necessary might well
permanently injure the infant's health<BR>at the impressionable age
at which he has arrived. The judge has regarded<BR>the infant's
welfare as the paramount consideration and he has decided<BR>that
this demands that he should remain with his foster parents.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Counsel
for the Appellants accepted that he could not ask the House<BR>to
overrule 'the discretion which has been exercised by the trial
judge<BR>unless he could show that it had been exercised upon some
wrong principle.<BR>This concession could not have been withheld. It
is not for this House<BR>to retry the case on the facts. The
Appellants argued that there were three<BR>grounds upon which it
could be said that the judge's decision had been<BR>exercised upon a
wrong principle.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Although
this is not the order in which counsel presented his arguments<BR>for
the Appellants, I will first deal with the proposition that as the
effect of<BR>the judge's order was a <I>de facto </I>adoption order
he ought not to have<BR>made it. Under sections 4 and 5 of the
Adoption Act, 1958, no order<BR>for the adoption of a child can be
made without the consent of the<BR>parents. The result of the order
giving the care and control of this infant<BR>to the foster parents
has, it is said, the effect of adoption because it is<BR>accepted
that it is unlikely that, although the order is until further
orders,<BR>the child will return to his parents in Madrid at any rate
until he leaves<BR>school. There are, however, substantial
differences between an adoption<BR>order and the order giving care
and control to the foster parents. The<BR>most important difference
is that an adoption order is permanent, while<BR>this order can be
varied at any time. In any case if the infant's welfare<BR>demands
the order, the Judge is entitled to make the order, albeit its<BR>effect
bears certain similarities to an adoption order. I do not think<BR>there
is any substance in this argument.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I turn
next to what is the most important submission. It is argued<BR>that
united parents are <I>prima facie </I>entitled to the custody of
their infant<BR>children and that the Court of Chancery as
representing the Queen as<BR><I>parens patriae </I>will only deprive
them of the care and control of their infant<BR>children if they are
unfitted by character, conduct or position in life to<BR>have this
control and that in the case of what has been described as

it<BR>&quot; may be with a view to the performance by him of duties
towards the<BR>&quot; children, and, in a sense, on condition of
performing those duties ;<BR>&quot; but there is great difficulty in
closely defining them. It is substantially<BR>&quot; impossible to
ascertain or watch over their full performance ; nor<BR>&quot; could
a Court of justice usefully attempt it. A man may be in<BR>&quot;
narrow circumstances ; he may be negligent; injudicious and faulty<BR>&quot;
as the father of minors ; he may be a person from whom the
discreet,<BR>&quot; the intelligent and the well-disposed, exercising
a private judgment,<BR>&quot; would wish his children to be, for
their sakes and his own. removed ;<BR>&quot; he may be all this
without rendering himself liable to judicial<BR>&quot; interference,
and in the main it is for obvious reasons well that it<BR>&quot;
should be so. Before this jurisdiction can be called into action<BR>&quot;
between them il must be satisfied, not only that it has the means
of<BR>&quot; acting safely and efficiently, but also that the father
has so conducted<BR>&quot; himself, or has shewn himself to be a
person of such a description,<BR>&quot; or is placed in such a
position, as to render it not merely better for<BR>&quot; the
children, but essential to their safety or to their welfare, in<BR>&quot;
some very serious and important respect, that his rights should be<BR>&quot;
treated as lost or suspended&mdash;should be superseded or
interfered<BR>&quot; with. If the word ' essential' is too strong an

consideration. However, in 1886 the Guardian-<BR>ship of Infants Act
was passed which, by section 1, provided that on the<BR>death of the

5 entitled the mother to apply to the Court who might make such<BR>order

the main consideration was the welfare of the<BR>&quot; child, and

the<BR>&quot; true interests of the child, would or ought to do, even
though the<BR>&quot; natural parent desired and had the Common Law
right to do other-<BR>&quot; wise, and had not been guilty of
misconduct; 3, The Judicature Act<BR>&quot; has made it the duty of
every Division of the High Court to exercise<BR>&quot; the Chancery
jurisdiction ; 4, In exercising the jurisdiction to control<BR>&quot;
or to ignore the parental right the Court must act cautiously, not
as<BR>&quot; if it were a private person acting with regard to his
own child, and<BR>&quot; acting in opposition to the parent only when

law in these cases is well settled, and, indeed, is not contested<BR>&quot;
by the learned counsel who argued the case before this House. On
the<BR>&quot; question of the religion in which a young child is to
be brought up,<BR>&quot; the wishes of the father of the child are to
be considered ; and, if there<BR>&quot; is no other matter to be
taken into account, then, according to the<BR>&quot; practice of our
Courts, the wishes of the father prevail. But that rule<BR>&quot; is
subject to this condition, that the wishes of the father only
prevail<BR>&quot; if they are not displaced by considerations
relating to the welfare of<BR>&quot; the children themselves. It is
the welfare of the children, which,<BR>&quot; according to rules
which are now well accepted, forms the paramount<BR>&quot;
considerations in these cases. Some of the earlier judgments
contain<BR>&quot; sentences in which perhaps greater stress is laid
upon the father's<BR>&quot; wishes than would be placed upon them now
; but in the more recent<BR>&quot; decisions, and especially since
the passing of the Guardianship of<BR>&quot; Infants Act, 1886,
section 5 of which Act shows the modern feeling<BR>&quot; in these
matters, the greater stress is laid upon the welfare and happiness<BR>&quot;
of the children. It is, of course, still true, as the learned counsel
who<BR>&quot; argued the case quite properly said, that a sufficient
case must be made<BR>&quot; for going contrary to the father's
wishes; but, if such a case is made,<BR>&quot; then the Courts have
no hesitation in deciding upon the whole facts<BR>&quot; of the
case.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The other
noble Lords concurred in this opinion. It is clear to me that<BR>even
prior to the 1925 Act the paramount consideration in regard to
the<BR>custody of infants was the infant's welfare. The father's
wishes were to be<BR>considered but only as one of the factors as
bearing on the child's welfare.<BR>The father had no &quot; right&quot;
as such to the care and control of his infant<BR>children. The
absence of authority in the intervening years between 1900<BR>and
1925 may have been due to the fact that the change in the climate
of<BR>social conditions was taking place gradually and its influence
on the Courts<BR>was almost imperceptible and was taking place in the
chambers of the<BR>Chancery Courts. But whatever may have been the
state of the law prior<BR>to the 1925 Act section 1 of that Act set
any doubts at rest and made it<BR>perfectly clear that the first and
paramount consideration was the welfare<BR>of the infant. I do not
agree with the Appellants' construction of section 1.<BR>It is, in my
view, of universal application and is not limited in its
application<BR>to questions as between parents. The preamble of an

The<BR>basis of the doctrine of comity is that there has been an
order by a foreign<BR>court and that the English Court will be
constrained on the ground of<BR>comity to do nothing to conflict with
that court's order. But there is no<BR>case reported where &quot;
comity &quot; has operated in the case of a foreign national<BR>where
there has been no order of a foreign court. Even then, a custody
order<BR>by a foreign court will not prevent an English Court from
making a custody<BR>order having regard to the welfare of the infant

merely one of the factors which the judge in exercis-<BR>ing his

slight and if it were not achieved<BR>there would be the greatest

Alexander for the appellants conceded that if the Courts below
had<BR>applied the right principles of law in reaching the decision
appealed from<BR>he could not succeed in asking your Lordships to
disturb that decision. The<BR>substance of his main argument may be
stated shortly. All parties were agreed<BR>that the Courts had
jurisdiction and a duty to interfere with the natural right<BR>of
parents to have the care control and custody of their child if the
welfare<BR>of the child required and the law permitted that course to
be taken. But<BR>there agreement ended. For the Appellants it was
submitted that the Court<BR>were in law bound to presume that the
welfare of the child was best served by<BR>allowing him to live with
his parents unless it was shown that it was not<BR>for his welfare to
do so because of their conduct, character or station in life.<BR>Mr.
Waite for the boy and Mrs. Puxon for the foster parents submitted<BR>on
the other hand, that there was no such presumption of law, that
the<BR>paramount and governing consideration was the welfare of the
child and<BR>that the claim of natural parents, although often of
great weight and cogency<BR>and often conclusive, had to be regarded
in conjunction with all other relevant<BR>factors, and had to yield
if, in the end, the welfare of the child so required.</FONT></FONT></P>

such<BR>a preumption as that contended for by the Appellants, or
whether the correct<BR>process of adjudication is, instead, to
consider all material aspects of the case,<BR>including the claims of
the parents, and then to decide in the exercise of a<BR>judicial
discretion what is best for the welfare of the child. I have
already<BR>mentioned Mr. Alexander's concession as to the position if
his argument does<BR>not prevail. I may add here that if it does
prevail the appeal, in my opinion,<BR>is bound to succeed since <I>(a)
</I>the evidence shows no defects of character<BR>or conduct on the
part of the parents sufficient to disentitle them to custody,<BR>and

There the<BR>question was whether a widowed mother should have the
custody of her<BR>daughter, a girl of fifteen, who was in the charge
of a lady who kept a home<BR>at Weymouth. The proceedings had been
instituted by the mother's appli-<BR>cation for a habeas corpus and
they exemplify the assumption by the Queen's<BR>Bench Division, under
section 25(10) of the Judicature Act, 1873, of the<BR>former Chancery
jurisdiction in relation to the custody of infants. But it<BR>is on
the present issue that the judgements of the Court of Appeal are
of<BR>outstanding importance. They agreed, affirming the Courts
below, that the<BR>mother should not be given custody, and they
undoubtedly enlarge the views<BR>as to jurisdiction expressed in <I>In
re Fynn </I>by Knight Bruce V.C. The mother's<BR>conduct was not
impugned and the submission advanced on her behalf was<BR>based on
her parental rights as fortified by sections 2 and 4 of the
Guardian-<BR>ship of Infants Act, 1886. Except in cases of misconduct
or desertion or<BR>abandonment of the parental right, the argument
continued, the Court could<BR>not &quot; interfere with the rights of
the parent or consider either what the wishes<BR>&quot; of the child
may be, or what they may think to be most for its benefit&quot;.<BR>Lord
Esher M.R. approached the judgement of Knight Bruce V.C. in <I>In

doubt that he<BR>and the other members of the Court were not content

This statement of the jurisdiction shews that, arising as it does
from<BR>&quot; the power of the Crown delegated to the Court of
Chancery, it is<BR>&quot; essentially a parental jurisdiction, and
that description of it involves<BR>&quot; that the main consideration
to be acted upon in its exercise is the<BR>&quot; benefit or welfare
of the child. Again, the term ' welfare ' in this<BR>&quot;
connection must be read in its largest possible sense, that is to
say,<BR>&quot; as meaning that every circumstance must be taken into
consideration,<BR>&quot; and the Court must do what under the

Now, my Lords, upon those facts the question is what ought to be<BR>&quot;
done as regards these children? The law in these cases is well<BR>&quot;
settled, and, indeed, is not contested by the learned counsel who<BR>&quot;
argued the case before this House. On the question of the religion<BR>&quot;
in which a young child is to be brought up, the wishes of the
father<BR>&quot; of the child are to be considered ; and, if there is
no other matter<BR>&quot; to be taken into account, then, according
to the practice of our Courts,<BR>&quot; the wishes of the father
prevail. But that rule is subject to this<BR>&quot; condition, that
the wishes of the father only prevail if they are not<BR>&quot;
displaced by considerations relating to the welfare of the children<BR>&quot;
themselves. It is the welfare of the children, which, according to
rules<BR>&quot; which are now well accepted, forms the paramount
considerations in<BR>&quot; these cases. Some of the earlier
judgments contain sentences in<BR>&quot; which perhaps greater stress
is laid upon the father's wishes than<BR>&quot; would be placed upon
them now ; but in the more recent decisions, and<BR>&quot; especially
since the passing of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886,<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

changes<BR>which occurred during the period covered by the

the modern feeling in these matters.&quot; By the<BR>Custody of
Infants Act, 1839 (Talfourd's Act), the mother of an infant in<BR>the
sole custody or control of the father was enabled to obtain from
the<BR>Court of Chancery an order for access and, until the child was
of the age<BR>of 7, an order for custody. This measure was replaced
by the Custody of<BR>infants Act, 1873, which <I>(a) </I>in effect
granted the same form of relief but<BR>with the age limit 16 instead
of 7 ; and <I>(b) </I>enacted that an agreement in a<BR>separation
deed providing for a transfer of custody from the father to
the<BR>mother should not be invalid on that ground alone ; but this
later provision<BR>was made subject to the proviso that the Court
should not enforce such an<BR>agreement if of opinion that it would
not be for the benefit of the infant to do<BR>so. The Guardianship of
Infants Act, 1886, carried reform a stage further.<BR>Section 2 made
a mother who survived the father the guardian of her infant<BR>child
either alone or jointly with a guardian appointed by the father or
the<BR>Court; section 3 conferred upon the mother powers of

questions as between the rights of father and mother which I have
already<BR>&quot; outlined&mdash;factors which cannot arise in the
case of an illegitimate child....&quot;<BR>Now, the latter part of
the section is directed to equalising the legal rights or<BR>claims
of the parents, and the preamble speaks only of achieving an
equality<BR>between the sexes in relation to the guardianship of
infants. But these<BR>considerations, do not, in my opinion, suffice
to constrict the natural meaning<BR>of the first part of the section.
The latter part beginning with the words<BR>&quot; shall not take
into consideration ...&quot; does not call for or imply any
such<BR>constriction for it does not necessarily apply to all the
possible disputes which<BR>the earlier part is capable of embracing ;
and as for the preamble, it could<BR>only be used to restrict the
applicability of the earlier part of the section if<BR>that part were
ambiguous. See <I>Attorney-General </I>v. <I>Prince Ernest
Augustus<BR>of Hanover, </I>[1957] A.C. 436, per Viscount Simonds at
463. Having read<BR>the whole statute, I cannot find this important
earlier part to be other than<BR>clear and unambiguous. On the
contrary, its wording seems to be deliberately<BR>wide and general.
It relates to <I>any </I>proceedings before <I>any </I>Court, and as
Eve<BR>J. said in <I>Clarke-Jervoise </I>v. <I>Scutt, </I>[1920] 1
Ch. 382 at 388&mdash;&quot; ' Any ' is a word<BR>&quot; with a very
wide meaning, and prima facie the use of it excludes limitation.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Thus read
the section would apply to cases, such as the present,
between<BR>parents and strangers. This construction finds further
support in the follow-<BR>ing considerations. In the first place,
since (as the statutes and authorities<BR>already mentioned by way of
background show) welfare was being regarded<BR>increasingly as a
general criterion which was not limited to custody disputes<BR>between
parents, it would be more than strange if the earlier part of
section<BR>1 were meant to apply only to that single type of dispute.
Secondly, the<BR>questions for decision which are expressly
mentioned&mdash;custody, upbringing,<BR>administration of property
belonging to or held in trust for the infant, and<BR>the application
of the income thereof&mdash;are of a kind to suggest the
involve-<BR>ment not only of parents but of others such as guardians
or trustees. And<BR>thirdly, there is nothing in the rest of the Act
to require a limited construction<BR>of section 1. Section 6, indeed,
would seem to point the other way for it<BR>provides for the
settlement by the Court of differences between joint
guardians<BR>affecting the welfare of an infant and there is no
apparent reason for con-<BR>fining this relief to differences between
parents or for taking proceedings<BR>therefor out of the ambit of
section 1. For these reasons I would hold that<BR>the present
proceedings are proceedings within that section.</FONT></FONT></P>

me that they must mean more than that<BR>the child's welfare is to be

weighed, the course to be<BR>followed will be that which is most in

of<BR>1925, came into operation, the proper custody of a girl of
seven. The<BR>father's wife had died soon after the child's birth and
the father then<BR>accepted the offer of his wife's sister and her

been refused. Eve J. awarded custody to the father and the Court
of<BR>Appeal held that he had applied the correct principles of law

his discretion. The<BR>head-note is so worded as to suggest that as

first and an order had to be made in his<BR>favour. On its face this,

does not stale that the welfare<BR>&quot; of the infant is to be the

Alexander, for the Appellants, supported his main submission with<BR>two

The first was based<BR>on the requirement, now provided for by
sections 4 and 5 of the Adoption<BR>Act, 1958, which makes the
consent of the parents a condition precedent<BR>to the granting of an
adoption order. The wardship jurisdiction, it was sub-<BR>mitted,
ought not to be exercised so as to create a <I>de facto </I>adoption
against<BR>the wishes of unimpeachable parents when no legal adoption
order could<BR>have been made without their consent. The short and,
as I see it, sufficient<BR>answer to this is that, however alike they
may be in their apparent affect,<BR>wardship orders as to custody and
adoption orders are so different in concept,<BR>nature and legal
consequences that one cannot validly argue from either<BR>of these
jurisdictions to the other. The second of these supporting
points<BR>was, in essence, a plea for comity. As we have here no

autumn of 1957 the parents, who had lived in somewhat uncom-<BR>fortable
conditions in a poor part of Madrid, came over to England to<BR>better
their circumstances, and they entered into domestic service
in<BR>Northamptonshire. They spoke virtually no English and when the
infant<BR>was born in hospital the foster mother (as she was to
become), a fluent<BR>Spanish speaker, then living with her husband
and family in the same<BR>county, where the husband carried on a
practice as a solicitor, was called in<BR>to help. The mother was
found to be suffering from some infectious<BR>ailment so could not
look after the infant. Though having no connection<BR>whatever with
the parents, the foster mother, out of the kindness of her<BR>heart
(and she already had a large young family to look after), took
the<BR>infant and looked after it when it was four days old. She and
her husband<BR>were formally appointed foster parents under section 1
of the Children's<BR>Act, 1948, by the Northamptonshire County
Council. In November, 1958,<BR>the foster parents moved to Oxted in
the County of Surrey with their<BR>family and the infant, and the

the<BR>foster parents were reluctant to accept the responsibility,
the infant was<BR>returned to them in July, 1961. As the learned

mother<BR>to pay a visit to her son, but for some reason,
unexplained, this never took<BR>place. In February, 1963, the
mother's mother, who had been looking after<BR>her other children in

permanent<BR>employment as a bricklayer with a substantial firm where
he has an<BR>exemplary character and should, in due course, receive
promotion. The<BR>family are now living in good accommodation ; as
the learned judge said<BR>in his judgment in 1967 &quot;they now have
a house in a modern housing<BR>&quot; estate with their own
independant piece of garden and five rooms &quot;, and<BR>the local

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In the
summer of 1963 there was some correspondence between the
foster<BR>parents and the parents and between the parents and the
children's officer<BR>of the County Council, which culminated in a
demand in September, 1963,<BR>by the mother for the return of the
infant. This terminated the jurisdiction<BR>of the County Council
(under the Childrens Act, see section 1(3)) who<BR>requested the
foster parents to return the child. They countered by issuing<BR>a
notice under section 3(2) of the Adoption Act, 1958, of an intention
to<BR>apply for an adoption order, and the County Council replied by
issuing<BR>a Summons on 6th December, 1963, asking that the infant
might be a ward<BR>of Court and seeking directions as to his custody,
care and control. The<BR>parents and foster parents were Respondents
to this Summons. So far<BR>as I know, no proceedings were taken to
adopt the infant, perhaps because<BR>of the obviously unsurmountable
difficulty of obtaining parental consent.<BR>There followed
protracted proceedings.</FONT></FONT></P>

there were long delays in filing evidence, but the Summons<BR>ultimately
came before Ungoed Thomas J. in July, 1965. There was a full<BR>hearing
before him on affidavit evidence, but the parents were not
represented<BR>at the hearing. However, the judge had before him a
lengthy written state-<BR>ment on behalf of the parents by a Spanish
lawyer, and counsel for the<BR>County Council, as the judge said, &quot;
put forward all the arguments on behalf<BR>&quot; of the parents &quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">On the
22nd July, 1965, the learned judge delivered judgment and
ordered<BR>that the care and control of the infant be committed to
the foster parents<BR>until further order but that he be brought up
in the Roman Catholic religion,<BR>his parents being of that faith.
He further directed that the infant should<BR>be brought up in the
knowledge and recognition of his parents and they were<BR>to have all
reasonable access to the infant when they or either of them should<BR>be
in England. The parents were informed of that decision by the Master.</FONT></FONT></P>

matter remained (save that in 1966, on the application of the<BR>County
Council, they ceased to be parties and the infant was made
plaintiff<BR>in their place) until January, 1967, when the foster
parents issued a Summons<BR>asking that the infant might henceforth
be brought up in the faith of the<BR>Church of England. My Lords, it
is, as I think, a sad commentary upon<BR>the attitude of some members
of the Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths,<BR>that in so many of
the reported cases over the last hundred years the real<BR>contest
has been as to the religious upbringing of the infant and orders<BR>have
been made with scant regard to the true welfare of the infant; and
I<BR>shall have to mention some of them at a later stage of this
Opinion. But<BR>in this case, as I understand it, the application was
based not on any doctrinal<BR>bias in favour of one faith rather than
the other but upon the difficulty<BR>as a practical matter of
obtaining suitable general education as well as<BR>religious
instruction in the Roman Catholic faith for an infant who comes<BR>from
an otherwise Protestant family (as the foster parents are) and it
was<BR>solely for the benefit of his general education that the
change was proposed<BR>to be made.</FONT></FONT></P>

control if the<BR>welfare of the child demands it, yet there is a
strong presumption that the<BR>welfare of a child is best served by
his living with his parents. So strong<BR>is this presumption that

the<BR>point, for if the Court does exercise its powers over foreign
children it<BR>must go into the facts and hand over the children to
the foreign parents<BR>resident abroad only if in the proper exercise
of its discretion it deems that<BR>to be the proper course. No
question of comity, as that word is ordinarily<BR>understood in

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">But the
preamble to an Act of Parliament does not always enumerate
every<BR>purpose of the Statute. It is by no means uncommon to find
the enacting<BR>part of the Act going beyond the bounds of the
preamble; and reasons more<BR>cogent than this are required to tailor
the enacting part of the Statute so as<BR>to make it fit the
preamble.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This the
Appellant agrees is true. He finds, however, the requisite reason<BR>in
this:&mdash;The Act of 1925 has been declared by some judges to enact
no<BR>new law. The Courts, they said, have always treated the welfare
of the<BR>infant as paramount. If this be so, I find some of the
decisions strange.<BR>Moreover, so the argument continues, the law
which was merely given<BR>declaratory expression by the Act, regarded
it as being a paramount require-<BR>ment for the welfare of the
infant that it should remain with its natural<BR>parents unless,
being capable of caring for it, they had by their character<BR>or
conduct, forfeited their rights to its custody and upbringing.
Accordingly<BR>a provision to this effect should be read into the
1925 Act.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This claim
led to a submission, no less interesting for being long, supported<BR>by
a copious citation of authority. For the reasons given by others of
your<BR>Lordships I find it unconvincing. It is incredible to me that
Parliament<BR>would pass such an enactment as section 1 of the 1925
Act if the position<BR>were that it made no difference at all to the
law as already expounded by<BR>the judges. Or that it would not have
incorporated a proviso preserving<BR>the alleged &quot; rights &quot;
of the natural parent if it had intended to preserve<BR>them. I think
the section means just what it says&mdash;no more and no less:<BR>and
although the claim of natural parents to the custody and
upbringing<BR>of their own children is obviously a most weighty
factor to be taken into<BR>consideration in deciding what is in the
best interests of the infant, yet the<BR>Legislature recognised that
this might not always be the determining factor,<BR>whether the
parents were unimpeachable or not.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This is
one such case. The boy was born here nearly eleven years ago<BR>and
has been with the foster parents ever since, with the exception of
some<BR>eighteen months in 1960 to 1961. He speaks little or no
Spanish. He regards<BR>the foster parents as his mother and father.
He is happily integrated into<BR>their family and is on terms of
close comradeship with their young son. He<BR>is about to commence
his further education. If he is now sent to Madrid<BR>against his
will it is inevitable that he will begin making comparisons
between<BR>what he has come to, and what he has left behind: and a
rankling sense<BR>of injustice and depression may result which will
not only hinder his<BR>resettlement, but could easily prejudice his
whole future. It is obvious that<BR>this result could be avoided, if
at all, only by the most patient and loving<BR>understanding and
sympathy on the part of his parents&mdash;particularly the<BR>father.
Mr. Justice Ungoed-Thomas's assessment of the father, based not<BR>only
on the father's letters to the foster mother, but on his personal
observa-<BR>tion of him and his answers in evidence, is that he lacks
the safeguarding<BR>qualities I have mentioned. The judge therefore
refused to take the risk of<BR>sending him back, and explained his
decision in a judgment to the clarity<BR>and the careful nature of
which I desire to pay a respectful tribute.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I also
would dismiss the appeal. This is not a case where parents are<BR>being
deprived for the time being of the custody and upbringing of
their<BR>son simply to pander to the wishes of foster parents who
have grown to<BR>love it. It is simply a case of the Courts obeying
the command of Parliament<BR>that the son's welfare is to be the
first and paramount consideration.</FONT></FONT></P>
