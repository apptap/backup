the advantage of reading in draft the speech<BR>about to be delivered

therefore, nothing useful that I can add on the<BR>merits of the

attached importance to my doing so I wish to<BR>add that they acted
in perfect good faith throughout, since, at the<BR>material time,

not aware of the essential fact of which<BR>there had been
non-disclosure.</FONT></FONT></P>

also wish to add that though, for the reasons given<BR>by my noble
and learned friend, I do not agree with it, I fully<BR>understand the
position of the respondent. A former wife is<BR>naturally reticent
about any plan she may have to remarry, and I<BR>do not think she was
fully aware (though she should have been) of<BR>the vital nature of
the information she was withholding from the<BR>other side and from
the court.</FONT></FONT></P>

effect a clean break between former spouses are, when<BR>there has
been full relevant disclosure, much to be encouraged,<BR>and,
properly negotiated, greatly reduce the pain and trauma of<BR>divorce.
They are, therefore, not lightly to be overthrown.</FONT></FONT></P>

compromise shall subsequently be given effect to by a<BR>consent
order of the court, is each of the former spouses under a<BR>remaining
duty to disclose to the other, or to the other's<BR>solicitors, the
occurrence of a material change in his or her<BR>situation, which has
taken place after the compromise has been<BR>reached, but before
effect has been given to it by the making of<BR>a consent order by
the court? The second question is this.<BR>Assuming that the
remaining duty referred to above exists, and is<BR>not complied with
by one of the two former spouses, so that a<BR>consent order is made
by the court without such material change<BR>having been taken into

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">As will
appear, a circuit judge and the Court of Appeal<BR>have held, in
effect, in the present case, in favour of a former<BR>wife and
against a former husband, that there is no remaining duty<BR>of
disclosure of the kind mentioned in the first question above;<BR>and
that, since there is no such duty, the second question referred<BR>to
above does not arise. The former husband now brings a further<BR>appeal
with regard to these matters, with the leave of the Court<BR>of
Appeal, to your Lordships' House.</FONT></FONT></P>

appellant is David Henry Jenkins and the respondent is<BR>Beryl
Livesey (formerly Jenkins). In what follows I shall for<BR>convenience
refer to them as &quot;the husband&quot; and &quot;the
wife&quot;<BR>respectively, despite the fact that, by reason of the
divorce which<BR>I shall mention shortly, they are no longer married
to each other.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The
husband and the wife were married on 20 February<BR>1957. There are
two children of the family, both boys: Matthew,<BR>now aged 15, and
Nicholas, now aged 13. Prior to 15 October<BR>1981 the husband and
the wife, with their two children, were<BR>living in a house near
Liskeard in Cornwall. That house, to which<BR>I shall refer from now
on as &quot;the matrimonial home,&quot; was owned<BR>jointly by the
husband and the wife, subject to a mortgage on it.<BR>On 15 October
1981, following marital disagreements apparently<BR>arising from the
husband's association with another woman, the<BR>husband left the
matrimonial home, since when he has never<BR>returned to live in it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Before the
husband left both he and the wife had consulted<BR>different firms of
solicitors about their marital troubles. As a<BR>result an exchange
of letters between these two firms, relating to<BR>the affairs of the
husband and the wife and the two children, had<BR>begun on 9
September 1981 and continued for a long time<BR>afterwards. In the
course of that correspondence the two firms of<BR>solicitors
succeeded in reaching agreement on a number of matters<BR>on behalf
of their respective clients.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The first
agreement was that, since the marriage had broken<BR>down
irretrievably, the wife should divorce the husband on the<BR>basis of
a written confession of adultery to be provided by him.<BR>The second
agreement was that the wife should have custody of<BR>the two
children, with reasonable access for the husband. The<BR>third
agreement was that, following the proposed divorce, there<BR>should
be a consent order of the court in respect of financial<BR>provision
and property adjustment, which would dispose finally of<BR>all claims
by both the husband and the wife in respect of such<BR>matters.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In
accordance with these agreements the wife presented a<BR>petition for
divorce in the Plymouth County Court, and on 1<BR>March 1982 was
granted a decree nisi in an undefended suit. That<BR>decree was made
absolute on 14 April 1982. Meanwhile<BR>negotiations with regard to
the proposed consent order for<BR>financial provision and property
adjustment were continuing, and on<BR>or about 12 August 1982 the
solicitors on either side reached final<BR>agreement about the form
and terms of such order.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The
proposed consent order so agreed contained two<BR>essential
provisions material to this appeal. The first such<BR>provision was
that the husband should transfer to the wife his<BR>half-share in the
matrimonial home, subject to the mortgage on it,<BR>for which the
wife would, after such transfer, have sole<BR>responsibility. The
expressed purpose of this transfer was to<BR>provide the wife with a
home entirely of her own, in which she<BR>could live with the two
children. The second essential provision<BR>was that, with the wife's
consent, all her claims for financial<BR>provision for herself should
be finally dismissed.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">It is
apparent from the correspondence between the<BR>solicitors on either
side that these two essential provisions of the<BR>proposed form of
consent order were interdependent, that is to say<BR>that, in
substance, the consideration for the transfer by the<BR>husband to
the wife of his half-share in the matrimonial home was<BR>the wife's
final abandonment of all claims by her for financial<BR>provision for
herself, and vice versa.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The
proposed consent order contained a number of other<BR>provisions in
addition to the two essential provisions referred to<BR>above. These
are not, however, directly relevant to the appeal,<BR>and it will
therefore be convenient to defer setting them out in<BR>full until a
later stage. The possibility of the wife deciding to re-<BR>marry
another man at any time, and more particularly of her<BR>doing so in
the near future, before the proposed consent order<BR>came to be put
into effect by the court, was never once<BR>mentioned in the
correspondence between the solicitors on either<BR>side, or between
the parties themselves.</FONT></FONT></P>

the suggestion that the wife had made any<BR>misrepresentation to the
husband or his solicitors, which induced<BR>him to agree to the
making of the consent order, cannot be<BR>supported. The true
position was that the wife, having become<BR>engaged to be married to
Thomas Livesey on 19 August 1982,<BR>failed to disclose that fact at
any time before the consent order<BR>was made on 2 September 1982.
The importance of that non-<BR>disclosure lay in this: that, by
section 28 of the Matrimonial<BR>Causes Act 1973, the wife would, on
remarriage, have lost<BR>permanently any right to any financial
provision from the husband.<BR>That being so, if the husband or his
solicitors had been informed<BR>of the intended remarriage at any
time before the consent order<BR>was made, it is clear that the
husband would have withdrawn his<BR>consent to the making of that
order, under which, in substance,<BR>the consideration for the
transfer by him to the wife of his half-<BR>share in the matrimonial
home was, as I indicated earlier, her<BR>agreement to the final
dismissal of ail her claims for financial<BR>provision for herself.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In
considering the questions from the point of view of<BR>principle,
there are four matters which I think that it is necessary<BR>to state
and emphasise from the beginning. The first matter is<BR>that the
powers of a judge of the Family Division of the High<BR>Court, or of
a judge of a divorce county court, to make orders for<BR>financial
provision and property adjustment following a divorce are<BR>conferred
on them, and conferred on them solely, by statute, the<BR>relevant
statute at the time of the proceedings out of which this<BR>appeal
arises being the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The second<BR>matter is
that there is no difference in this respect between a<BR>judge's
powers to make such orders after a disputed hearing<BR>involving
evidence on both sides, and his powers to make such<BR>orders by the
consent of the parties without having heard any<BR>evidence at all.
The third matter is that the powers of registrars<BR>to make such
orders, when delegated to them by rules of court,<BR>are exactly the
same as those of judges, whether the proceedings<BR>concerned are in
the principal registry of the Family Division, or<BR>in the registry
of a divorce county court. The fourth matter is<BR>that, when parties
agree the provisions of a consent order, and the<BR>court
subsequently gives effect to such agreement by approving
the<BR>provisions concerned and embodying them in an order of the
court,<BR>the legal effect of those provisions is derived from the
court order<BR>itself, and does not depend any longer on the
agreement between<BR>the parties: <U>de Lasala v. de Lasala</U>

contested cases relating to the exercise of the court's<BR>powers

prescribed information is met by rules of court with<BR>which both
parties must comply. The relevant rules are the<BR>Matrimonial Causes
Rules 1977 (S.1 1977 No.344). Rules 73 to 76<BR>deal with affidavit
evidence to be filed. Rule 77 deals with the<BR>investigation by a
registrar of applications, in the course of which<BR>one party may be
compelled to give further information to the<BR>other on any material
matter; orders may be made for lists or<BR>affidavits of documents

I do not consider that the manner in which Tudor<BR>Evans J. disposed

which he disposed of the third ground of claim,<BR>however, I am
clearly of opinion that he erred in law. That he<BR>did so is
understandable, because the husband's attack was directed<BR>primarily
at the agreement between the parties, and only<BR>secondarily at the
consent order made pursuant to it, whereas<BR>what really mattered
was that consent order, from which, once it<BR>had been made, the

on the terms of section 25(1) of the Act of 1973,<BR>could not in any
circumstances be rendered inapplicable by the<BR>manner in which the

concerned does not depend in any way on<BR>the concept that the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In
<U>Robinson v. Robinson (Disclosure)</U> (1983) 4 F.L.R. 102
the<BR>requirement of full and frank disclosure in relation to a
consent<BR>order was forcefully upheld by the Court of Appeal. In
that case<BR>the parties had been divorced in 1973, at which time the
husband<BR>was ordered to make periodical payments for the wife
and<BR>children. The amount of those payments was increased by
the<BR>Court of Appeal later in the same year. In 1976, on
an<BR>application by the husband for the periodical payments to the
wife<BR>herself to be suspended or reduced, the judge discharged the
order<BR>for such payments in her favour, and made an order, to which
the<BR>wife consented, under which she accepted a lump sum in full
and<BR>final settlement of all her claims against the husband. In
1983<BR>the wife applied to a judge at first instance for the two
previous<BR>orders of 1973 and 1976 to be set aside on the ground
that the<BR>husband had, on each occasion, misrepresented or
inadequately<BR>represented his financial position. The judge having
dismissed her<BR>claim, the wife brought an appeal to the Court of
Appeal. That<BR>court allowed the appeal and set aside both orders.
Its reasons<BR>for doing so appear from the headnote of the report.
The first<BR>ground was that, in proceedings for ancillary relief,
there was a<BR>duty, both under the rules and by authority, on the
parties to<BR>make full and frank disclosure of their property and
financial<BR>resources; accordingly the power to set aside orders was
not<BR>limited to cases of fraud or mistake, but extended to cases
of<BR>material non-disclosure; where it could be said that, on the
true<BR>facts, the orders should not have been made, then the orders
could<BR>be set aside. The second ground was that, although
intensive<BR>research might have revealed to the wife the husband's
financial<BR>position, it was clear that both in 1973, and in the
proceedings<BR>leading up to his application in 1976, the husband had
not provided<BR>the wife with the full and frank disclosure to which
she was<BR>entitled; accordingly the orders would be set aside, so
that the<BR>parties could either settle their differences, or go to
court for a<BR>settlement based on the position in 1982.</FONT></FONT></P>

challenge, on the ground that it was<BR>obtained by fraud or mistake,
a judgment or order that<BR>finally disposes of the issues raised
between the parties, the<BR>only ways of doing it that are open to
him are by appeal<BR>from the judgment or order to a higher court or
by bringing<BR>a fresh action to set it aside.' There are many
references<BR>in the books to separate actions to set aside a
judgment on<BR>the ground of fraud. In the Family Division, as has
been<BR>said many times, this power to set aside final orders is
not<BR>limited to cases when fraud or mistake can be alleged.
It<BR>extends, and has always extended, to cases of material
non-<BR>disclosure ... A distinction has to be drawn between
the<BR>restrictions imposed by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973
on<BR>varying lump sum orders or property adjustment orders<BR>which
cannot be varied, and the power to set aside an order<BR>which has
been obtained by fraud or mistake, or by material<BR>non-disclosure.
The essence of the distinction is that the<BR>power to vary usually
reflects changes of circumstances<BR>subsequent to the date of the
order, whereas the power to<BR>set aside arises where there has been
fraud, mistake, or<BR>material non-disclosure as to the facts <U>at
the time the<BR>order was made</U> [my emphasis]. From the point of
view of<BR>convenience, there is a lot to be said for proceedings
of<BR>this kind taking place before a judge at first

difficult<BR>issues of fact to be determined before the power to
set<BR>aside can be exercised. These can be determined more<BR>easily,
as a rule, by a judge at first instance. Moreover, he<BR>can go on to
make the appropriate order which we cannot<BR>do in this court. I
think that these proceedings should<BR>normally be started before a
judge at first instance,<BR>although there may be special
circumstances which make it<BR>better to proceed by way of appeal.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

decision of the Court of Appeal in <U>Jenkins v. Livesey<BR>(formerly

is made for a financial provision or property<BR>adjustment order the
court is required to have before it an<BR>agreed statement of the
general nature of the means of<BR>each party signed by the parties or
their solicitors. If<BR>affidavits of means have been filed it will
be sufficient if<BR>the statement is in the form of a certificate
that there has<BR>been no change of substance since the date of the
affidavit<BR>or if there has, what changes there have been. If no
such<BR>evidence has been filed the statement should include

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The third
matter relates to the form of the consent order<BR>made in this case.
I said earlier that its form was open to a<BR>number of criticisms,
and it is right that I should now indicate<BR>what these criticisms
are. When a consent order is drafted it is<BR>essential that all its
terms should come clearly within the court's<BR>powers conferred on
it by sections 23 and 24 of the Act of 1973.<BR>In the present case
there are several terms which are not within<BR>those powers. These
are paragraph 2, which directs that the wife<BR>shall be solely
responsible, after the transfer to her of the<BR>husband's half-share
in the matrimonial home, for the mortgage on<BR>it and all other
outgoings relating to it; and paragraphs 4, 5 and<BR>6, which direct
that the husband and the wife are to be solely<BR>responsible for
certain specified bank overdrafts and loan accounts.<BR>There is
nothing in sections 23 or 24 of the Act of 1973 which<BR>directly
empowers the court to make orders of these kinds. That<BR>being so,
the proper procedure for incorporating the obligations<BR>concerned
into a consent order is by formulating them as<BR>undertakings given
to the court. Such undertakings are, needless<BR>to say, enforceable
as effectively as direct orders.</FONT></FONT></P>

and final matter arises out of certain<BR>observations made by Sir

in an unreported case, <U>Wells v. Wells,<BR></U>decided on 18 June
1980. Sir John Arnold P., on p. 6 of the<BR>transcript, expressed the
view that this case was decided per<BR>incuriam and should not be
followed. Since I gave the only<BR>judgment in the case, with which
Ormrod L.J. agreed, I feel some<BR>diffidence in questioning the
learned President's observations.<BR>Despite such diffidence,
however, I think that I should, in defence<BR>both of Ormrod L.J. and
of myself, express my firm view that<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><U>Wells
v. Wells</U> was in no way decided per incuriam. The history<BR>of
the case is simple. On 2 October 1979 Booth J. had made an<BR>order
in contested proceedings for financial provision and
property<BR>adjustment. In December 1979 the wife began to associate
with<BR>another man whom she had known before; later she began
living<BR>with him; and on 19 April 1980 she married him. Four
days<BR>earlier, on 15 April 1980, the husband applied to a division
of the<BR>Court of Appeal, in which to the best of my recollection I
myself<BR>was not sitting, for leave to appeal out of time from the
order of<BR>Booth J. dated 2 October 1979, on the ground of a radical
change<BR>of circumstances occurring after that order had been made.
Leave<BR>to appeal out of time was given, and later the substantive
appeal<BR>came before a different division of the Court of Appeal,
consisting<BR>of Ormrod L.J. and myself. It was apparent that the
whole basis<BR>on which Booth J. had made her order had been
falsified by events<BR>occurring within about three months of the
date on which it had<BR>been made. Ormrod L.J. and I accordingly took
the view that, in<BR>order that justice should be done, Booth J.'s
order, based on a<BR>state of affairs falsified by later events,
should be set aside, and<BR>that a different order, based on the true
state of affairs by then<BR>existing, should be substituted for it. I
can see that two views<BR>might be taken of the prior decision to
give the husband leave to<BR>appeal out of time at all. That decision
having been made,<BR>however, I cannot see that the court hearing the
substantive<BR>appeal could have done otherwise than allow it and
substitute a<BR>just order for what, in the events which had since
occurred, was<BR>plainly an unjust order.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">My Lords,
I hope that I have not taken up too much time<BR>with these
subsidiary matters, since they do not bear directly on<BR>the
decision of this appeal. As to that, I have indicated earlier<BR>the
order which I have concluded should be made on the appeal,<BR>and my
reasons for reaching that conclusion.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I would
end with an emphatic word of warning. It is not<BR>every failure of
frank and full disclosure which would justify a<BR>court in setting
aside an order of the kind concerned in this<BR>appeal. On the
contrary, it will only be in cases when the<BR>absence of full and
frank disclosure has led to the court making,<BR>either in contested
proceedings or by consent, an order which is<BR>substantially
different from the order which it would have made if<BR>such
disclosure had taken place that a case for setting aside can<BR>possibly
be made good. Parties who apply to set aside orders on<BR>the ground
of failure to disclose some relatively minor matter or<BR>matters,
the disclosure of which would not have made any<BR>substantial
difference to the order which the court would have<BR>made or
approved, are likely to find their applications being<BR>summarily
dismissed, with costs against them, or, if they are<BR>legally aided,
against the legal aid fund.</FONT></FONT></P>
