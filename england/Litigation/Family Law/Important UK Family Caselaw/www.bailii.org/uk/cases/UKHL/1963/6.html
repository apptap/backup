<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This case
requires a decision of the question whether an insane person<BR>can
be held to have treated his wife (or her husband) with cruelty.
The<BR>facts are not in dispute and they are clearly stated in the
judgment of Mr.<BR>Commissioner Gallop, Q.C., so I need only state in
outline those which<BR>are relevant to the issue. The Respondent is a
miner. For the first ten<BR>years of married life his behaviour was
not above reproach, but he was never<BR>guilty of deliberate cruelty.
There is insanity in his family, and in 1954<BR>he began to hear
voices and to think that people were after him. He<BR>was admitted to
hospital as a voluntary patient for three months, and on his<BR>return
home his wife says his condition was worse. One night he thought<BR>he
heard people talking about him. He got up and dressed and went<BR>out
with a knife looking for the people who were tormenting him. His<BR>wife
reported this, and he was certified insane and taken back to
hospital.<BR>It is found as a fact on medical evidence that from then
until the trial<BR>in 1962 he was certifiably insane, and the
evidence suggests that this is<BR>incurable. He frequently returned
home for week-ends, but he was restless,<BR>and the voices began to
say that his wife was a prostitute. Nevertheless<BR>in 1958 he was
regarded as a voluntary patient, and in March, 1959, he<BR>discharged
himself and went home. His wife did not want to have him,<BR>but says
she could not stop him coming.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">For the
next nine months he was at home and his conduct during that<BR>time
caused damage to the wife's health. This was caused by the
voices<BR>which told him of men up in the loft of the house and of
his wife's persistent<BR>adultery. He persisted in accusing her: if
she tried to get away he would<BR>follow her about the house.
Sometimes he would climb up into the loft<BR>to find the men. The
learned Commissioner had no difficulty in holding<BR>that the case
was proved unless the second limb of the M'Naghten Rules<BR>applies.
He held that the Respondent knew what he was doing in making<BR>these
accusations but that he did not know that they were wrong in
any<BR>sense of the word. The medical evidence was that he thought
that his<BR>accusations were based on sound fact and that he was
fully justified in trying<BR>to resolve what was otherwise an
intolerable situation.</FONT></FONT></P>

blameworthiness or culpability of the conduct<BR>&quot; in question.
That is if one treats the word ' wrong ' as meaning what<BR>&quot;
<I>Windle's </I>case [1952] 2 Q.B. 826, said it does not mean. If
one<BR>&quot; treats the word ' wrong' as what the Court of Criminal

cruelty cases has nothing<BR>&quot; to do with criminal law, or tort

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In my
judgment, before we come to the M'Naghten Rules at all, we must<BR>first
decide the general question whether insanity in any sense is a
defence<BR>to a petition for divorce for cruelty. The position as I
see it is this.<BR>Before 1857 divorce <I>a mensa et thoro </I>on the
ground of cruelty was a well-<BR>established remedy given by the
Ecclesiastical Courts. By the Matrimonial<BR>Causes Act, 1857, the
jurisdiction of those Courts was transferred to Her<BR>Majesty's
Courts: divorce <I>a mensa et thoro </I>became judicial separation,
but<BR>the same principles continued to apply. By the Matrimonial
Causes Act,<BR>1937 (now consolidated in the Act of 1950), divorce
for cruelty was intro-<BR>duced for the first time. The Act requires
that the respondent shall have<BR>&quot; treated the petitioner with
cruelty &quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">There has
been much argument about the meaning of the word &quot; treated &quot;.<BR>I
attach no importance whatever to that word. What Parliament did
in<BR>1937 was to provide an additional remedy for cruelty. It did
not touch<BR>the older remedy of judicial separation which is still
available. So for<BR>that remedy cruelty must have the same meaning
today as it had before<BR>1937. It is incredible that cruelty now has
a different meaning according to<BR>which remedy is chosen. But quite
apart from that it seems to me obvious<BR>that Parliament cannot have
intended to alter the former meaning of cruelty.<BR>If it had been
intended to alter the meaning no one in or out of Parliament<BR>would
have been so foolish as to leave that intention, and the extent
of<BR>the intended alteration of meaning, to be inferred from the
mere use of the<BR>word &quot; treated &quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Accordingly
it is necessary to see what the old law was. We have been<BR>referred

The<BR>earliest was <I>Hayward </I>v. <I>Hayward, </I>1 Sw. &amp; Tr.
81, and I get little or no<BR>help from that case. But ungovernable
passion, or a state of mind which<BR>was far from normal, was not
unfamiliar, and I think it very helpful to<BR>see how those great
judges Lord Stowell and Dr. Lushington dealt with<BR>this matter.</FONT></FONT></P>

<I>Kirkman </I>v. <I>Kirkman </I>(1807) 1 Hag. </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Cons.
409 Lord Stowell (then<BR>Sir W. Scott) said : &quot; The evidence
most clearly established that the wife<BR>&quot; is not mistress of
her own passions; and the Court would be wanting in<BR>&quot; due
attention to the safety of the injured party in this case if it did
not<BR>&quot; pronounce for a separation as absolutely necessary for
that purpose.&quot; In<BR><I>Holden </I>v. <I>Holden </I>1810 1 Hag.
Cons. 453 Lord Stowell said: &quot;The Court<BR>&quot; has had
frequent occasions to observe that everything is in legal
construction<BR>&quot; <I>saevitia </I>which tends to bodily harm and
in that manner renders co-<BR>&quot; habitation unsafe; wherever
there is a tendency only to bodily mischief<BR>&quot; it is a peril
from which the wife must be protected: because it is unsafe<BR>&quot;
for her to continue in the discharge of her conjugal duties; and to
enforce<BR>&quot; that obligation upon her might endanger her
security and perhaps her<BR>&quot; life. It is not necessary in
determining this point to inquire from what<BR>&quot; motive such
treatment proceeds&mdash;It may be from turbulent passion or<BR>&quot;
sometimes from causes which are not inconsistent with affection and
are<BR>&quot; indeed often connected with it, as the passion of
jealousy.&quot; Dr. Lushington<BR>was even more emphatic. He said in
<I>Dysart </I>v. <I>Dysart </I>(1844) 1 Robert. 106<BR>at p. 116: &quot;
When I find conduct towards a wife likely to prove dangerous<BR>&quot;
to her safety, but not in other cases, I shall consider it within my
cog-<BR>&quot; nisance, whatever may have been the cause thereof,
whether having arisen<BR>&quot; from natural violence of disposition,
from want of moral control, or<BR>&quot; from eccentricity. It is for
me to consider the conduct itself, and its<BR>&quot; probable
consequences ; the motives and causes cannot hold the hand of<BR>&quot;
the Court, unless the wife be to blame, which is a wholly different
con-<BR>&quot; sideration. In plainer words, even if I were satisfied
that conduct<BR>&quot; dangerous in itself arose from morbid
feelings, out of the control of the<BR>&quot; husband, I must act, if
the danger exist, though it is not my province to<BR>&quot; inquire
into or ascertain such cause.&quot; I find it difficult to believe
that<BR>either of those great judges if confronted with a case of
insanity would<BR>have said that then he was powerless to afford any
protection. And, apart<BR></SPAN></FONT></FONT><BR>

rendering the party liable to fits of un-<BR>&quot; governable

this Court is bound to emancipate her from such peril.&quot; The same

J. P.<BR>Wilde) said: &quot; I have no doubt that cruelty does not
cease to be a cause<BR>&quot; of suit if it proceeded from ' violent
and disorderly affections', as said<BR>&quot; in one case, or from '
violence of disposition, want of moral control, or<BR>&quot; '
eccentricity', as said in another, or ' from a liability to become
excited<BR>&quot; ' in controversy', in the language of a third: but
madness, dementia,<BR>&quot; positive disease of the mind, this is
quite another matter. An insane man<BR>&quot; is likely enough to be
dangerous to his wife's personal safety, but the<BR>&quot; remedy
lies in the restraint of the husband, not the release of the wife.<BR>&quot;
Though the object of this Court's interference is safety for the
future, its<BR>&quot; sentence carries with it some retribution for
the past.&quot; A similar result<BR>was reached in the Scottish case
of <I>Steuart </I>v. <I>Steuart </I>(1870) 8 M. 821. And<BR>stress
has been laid in other cases on certification of insanity being
an<BR>adequate protection. But the facts of the present case show
that, owing to<BR>modern methods of treatment, certification is not
now always an adequate<BR>protection. This Respondent was released
though still certifiable, and then<BR>caused the injury to her health
which the Appellant has proved. If the<BR>several learned judges who
relied on certification as a protection had had<BR>to consider
circumstances in which it was not, I am by no means sure that<BR>they
would have reached the same result. They would have had to weigh<BR>the
fact that separation is &quot; some retribution &quot; and is
permanent even if the<BR>insane man recovers against the present
danger to the wife if no remedy<BR>is given. Looking to the paramount
importance which was attached to<BR>protection they might well have
decreed separation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<I>Yarrow<BR></I>[1892] P. 92 the President (Sir C. Butt) said: &quot;I
am by no means sure&mdash;<BR>&quot; though I express no opinion upon
it now&mdash;that insanity which would<BR>&quot; entitle an accused
to an acquittal on an indictment for a crime would<BR>&quot;

adultery.&quot;<BR><I>Hanbury </I>v. <I>Hanbury </I>[1892] P. 222 was
a petition for divorce on the ground<BR>of adultery coupled with
cruelty. Sir C. Butt considered at some length<BR>the question of
intermittent or recurrent insanity where the husband would<BR>be
entitled to go home from time to time when he recovered. He said<BR>that
though the insanity &quot; may assume the form of a disease, yet if
it is such<BR>&quot; as to imperil the wife's safety she is entitled
to the protection of this<BR>&quot; Court&quot;. The jury found that
the husband was capable of understanding<BR>&quot; the nature and
consequences &quot; of his acts and decree was pronounced.<BR>In the
Court of Appeal (8 T.L.R. 559) Lord Esher took this to mean that<BR>he
knew what he was doing and that he was doing wrong, and said : &quot;
If the<BR>&quot; disease in the mind of the person doing the act was
not so great as to<BR>&quot; make him unable to understand the nature
and consequences of the<BR>&quot; act which he was doing, that was an
act for which he would be civilly or<BR>&quot; criminally responsible
to the law &quot;. He reserved his opinion on the question<BR>whether
the petitioner would be entitled to divorce if the respondent did
not<BR>know the nature of what he was doing or that he was doing
wrong. There<BR>appear to be no reported cases on this matter between

with the later cases more briefly. The first relevant case under<BR>the
1937 Act was <I>Astle </I>v. <I>Astle </I>[1939] P. 415. There the
respondent did<BR>not know the nature and quality of those acts done
while he was insane<BR>and Henn Collins, J., held that those acts
could therefore not be held to be<BR>cruelty. The learned judge took
this view chiefly because &quot; the respondent<BR>&quot; would not
be held answerable outside this Court either civilly or criminally<BR>&quot;
for his assaults &quot;, and he thought that the M'Naghten Rules
should apply<BR>because they are the test applied in all other
courts. In fact, counsel in the<BR>present case were unable to find
any civil case, other than <I>Hanbury (cit. sup.)<BR></I>and more
recent divorce cases, in which the M'Naghten Rules have been<BR>applied.
But the learned judge was able to grant decree on another
ground.<BR>And, indeed, the present case appears to be the first
reported case in which<BR>a petitioner has failed to get relief on
some ground against a spouse who<BR>was insane.</FONT></FONT></P>

</I>case was criticised in <I>Squire </I>v. <I>Squire </I>[1949] P.
51, where the view<BR>that cruelty must be deliberate, malignant or
intended was rejected. Lord<BR>Tucker refused to dispose of the case
on the ground that the wife's conduct<BR>was not actuated by spite
but was due solely to her state of health. My<BR>noble and learned
friend, Lord Evershed, having pointed out that the wife<BR>was not
insane, said : &quot; She remained at all material times responsible
for her<BR>&quot; actions. If, therefore, her conduct to her husband
was in fact cruel, she<BR>&quot; cannot, as it seems to me, escape
its natural consequences.&quot; A good deal<BR>was said about the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><I>White
</I>v. <I>White </I>[1950] P. 39 is an important case. There it was
held, as<BR>the headnote states, that the mere fact that the
respondent was insane is no<BR>defence. The Commissioner had held
that the wife's mind was diseased and<BR>that she was not responsible
for her acts of cruelty. Bucknill, L.J., quoted<BR>and followed the
judgment of Lord Esher in <I>Hanbury </I>which in effect applied<BR>the
M'Naghten Rules. This respondent's type of insanity did not
come<BR>within those rules and was therefore disregarded. Bucknill,
L.J., reserved<BR>his opinion on whether the petitioner would have
been entitled to protection<BR>if the respondent had come within the
M'Naghten Rules, and indicated<BR>that danger might be removed to
some extent because a spouse may be able<BR>to defeat a petition for
restitution of conjugal rights although he fails to<BR>prove legal
cruelty. Asquith, L.J., gave as one of his reasons a ground<BR>which
to my mind is clearly wrong. He thought that if insanity is
immaterial<BR>it must follow logically that no state of mind,
intention or knowledge of the<BR>aggressor can be relevant. To my
mind <I>non sequitur: </I>it is not illogical,<BR>though it might be
wrong in law, to say that some conduct is so bad that<BR>it is cruel
in itself (which seems to have been the view of Dr. Lushington<BR>in
<I>Dysart) </I>while other conduct may be equivocal so that it can be
excused<BR>by illness or insanity but aggravated by deliberate
intention. But he went on<BR>to say &quot; it is plain that the
presence of insanity of some sort or other,<BR>&quot; without more,
will not necessarily afford a defence.&quot; Unfortunately he<BR>did
not say why that was plain. Of course, if the insanity is of a
type<BR>which did not in any way cause the cruel acts that would be
plain. But<BR>he must have meant more than that because in <I>White's
</I>case the insanity<BR>did give rise to the cruel acts, and it was
only because the insanity was of<BR>a type which did not fit the
M'Naghten Rules that he was for granting<BR>decrees of divorce.
Denning, L.J., thought that the M'Naghten Rules do<BR>not apply to
divorce, that this woman, if charged with a crime, would have<BR>been
found insane by a jury, but that insanity is no defence in
divorce<BR>proceedings.</FONT></FONT></P>

also referred to a number of Scottish authorities&mdash;quite
properly<BR>because, as was said in <I>Jamieson </I>v. <I>Jamieson
</I>[1952]<I> </I>A.C. 525, there was no<BR>difference in principle
as to what is cruelty for the purpose of separation<BR>although there
might be differences in the way in which principles were<BR>applied.
The cases show that the picture is broadly the same in
both<BR>countries. With regard to insanity being a defence the law
was not clear.<BR>In <I>Inglis </I>v. <I>Inglis, </I>1931 S.C. 547,
Lord Moncrieff emphasised the importance<BR>of protection, but Lord
Anderson thought that cruelty must be intentional<BR>or with wilful
disregard of consequences. In <I>McLachlan </I>v. <I>McLachlan,<BR></I>1945
S.C. 382, Lord Moncrieff's view prevailed, and this case was
followed<BR>in <I>Dobbie </I>v. <I>Dobbie, </I>1953 S.C. 379, 1955
S.C. 371. In <I>M'Kenzie </I>v.<BR><I>M'Kenzie </I>1960 S.C. 322,
Lord Walker held that insanity was no defence, but<BR>in <I>Breen </I>v.
<I>Breen, </I>1961 S.C. 158, the Second Division held that insanity
was<BR>a defence. This was a case which would not have come within
the<BR>M'Naghten Rules, but the M'Naghten Rules are not part of the
law of<BR>Scotland. But the defender was certifiable and his acts
were committed<BR>under the influence of his insanity. Lord Patrick
said (at p. 185) that the<BR>defender was not responsible for his
conduct &quot; because that conduct was<BR>&quot; influenced by his
insanity, so that he was disabled from forming a rational<BR>&quot;
decision in regard to it.&quot; Lord Mackintosh said (at p. 188) that
&quot; insanity,<BR>&quot; if shown to be related to the acts of
cruelty complained of, is a good<BR>&quot; defence &quot;. Lord
Strachan said (at p. 197): &quot; The defender was not able<BR>&quot;
to exert his reason to control his reactions in the normal way. I
therefore<BR>&quot; hold that he was not responsible for his violent
acts and that he cannot be<BR>&quot; held guilty of cruelty.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

their inherent defects, the M'Naghten Rules cannot be applied<BR>to
civil cases in the same way as they are applied in criminal cases.
There<BR>are many indications that the rules have often been applied
liberally or<BR>even loosely in criminal cases. Much evidence was
taken from distinguished<BR>and experienced witnesses by the Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment,<BR>and in their Report (1953 Cmd.

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I have
come to be clearly of opinion that it would be wrong to take
the<BR>M'Naghten Rules as a test. Not only have these rules been
subject to<BR>persistent and powerful criticism for nearly a hundred
years, but their strict<BR>application would lead to capricious
results. It appears to be the general<BR>opinion of medical men, who
at least have a better understanding of insanity<BR>than lawyers,
that there are types of insanity not within the rules which<BR>deprive
the insane man of choice or responsibility just as much as
those<BR>types which are covered by the rules. So if guilt,
culpability, or blame-<BR>worthiness in some degree is to be held a
necessary element in cruelty, I can<BR>see no rational basis for
holding that if two persons are in fact equally<BR>irresponsible one
is to be divorced because his type of insanity does not come<BR>within
the rules, but the other is to have a defence because his case is
covered<BR>by the rules.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The second
possibility is that insanity should be a defence if it is so bad<BR>that
the insane person does not know what he is doing, but not
otherwise.<BR>This test seems straightforward whereas the test that a
man knows that his<BR>acts are wrong may seem simple but in fact is
not: it is a test which experts<BR>seem to have great difficulty in
applying. Moreover I think that many<BR>people would say that if a
man does not know what he is doing his acts<BR>are not really his
acts at all, but they have at least a lingering suspicion<BR>that
when a man does know what he is doing he cannot be wholly<BR>blameless
whatever the experts may say. I think that this is a possible<BR>halfway
house, but I would not much favour it myself. It is still subject<BR>to
the objection that it discriminates between people who on evidence
are<BR>proved to be equally irresponsible by reason of disease of the
mind. But<BR>I must recognise that, if we are thinking of protection,
a man who does<BR>not know what he is doing will, except in cases of
epilepsy or temporary<BR>lapses into insanity, generally be detained,
whereas a man certifiable for<BR>less serious types of insanity may
be released at least for a time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">So it
remains for me to choose between the two clear cut
alternatives&mdash;<BR>either insanity is a defence or it is not. I
think that ultimately the answer<BR>must depend on the meaning one
gives to the word &quot; cruel&quot;, and on this<BR>there are
obviously two opinions even among judges. Some think there<BR>cannot
be cruelty without some kind of <I>mens rea </I>and some think there
can.<BR>To my mind &quot; cruelty &quot; is a word that can take its
meaning from its<BR>context: often it connotes blameworthiness but
quite often it does not.<BR>Let me give one or two examples. Even in
comparatively recent times<BR>practically everyone, including men of
the highest integrity and intelligence<BR>who were quite as civilised
as any of us, firmly believed that persecution<BR>in one form or
another was not only excusable but was a moral duty.<BR>Few would
deny that their acts were cruel, but I do not see how we
can<BR>reasonably blame them for not having anticipated modern ideas.
And<BR>is it a misuse of language to call a cat cruel? Again, when we
speak of<BR>the cruel sea no doubt we personify the sea but do we
blame it? So the<BR>law cannot just take cruelty in its ordinary or
popular meaning because that<BR>is too vague: we must decide what, if
any, mental state is a necessary<BR>ingredient.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">If some
mental or subjective element is necessary, the first possibility
is<BR>that there must have been malignity or an intention to hurt.
But that has<BR>long been abandoned. Such an intention may be an
aggravation and may<BR>justify holding that acts are cruel where
without that intention they would<BR>not be sufficiently grave and
weighty to amount to cruelty: but it is not<BR>essential. The next
possibility is that there must be some degree of <I>mens<BR>rea, </I>that
at least the respondent must be blameworthy for what he did&mdash;<BR>and
that requires careful consideration. But opinions have been
expressed<BR>that it is enough if his acts were intentional, if he
knew what he was doing,<BR>although he could not be held blameworthy.
That would be a basis for<BR>holding that insanity is a defence if
the insane person did not know what<BR>he was doing, but not
otherwise. I have already dealt with that and I need<BR>not say any
more about it than that that view would lead to this appeal<BR>being
allowed because it is clear that this Respondent knew what he
was<BR>doing but thought by reason of his delusions that he was
justified in what<BR>he did. So to my mind the alternatives are
either that no mental element<BR>is essential or that the Respondent

blameworthy. It would be necessary to consider<BR>the particular

comes before your Lordships' House raising a single
question,<BR>apparently but deceptively limited, namely, whether the
second of the so-<BR>called M'Naghten Rules applies in the case of a
petition for divorce on<BR>the ground of cruelty with the effect in
the present case of defeating the<BR>petitioner's claim. The facts of
the case are sufficiently stated in the Opinion<BR>of my noble and
learned friend, Lord Reid, and I do not repeat them. It is<BR>sufficient
to say that the learned Commissioner found <I>first </I>that the
Respon-<BR>dent husband was aware of the nature and quality of the
acts he was doing<BR>(namely, of his persistent accusation of his
wife that she was committing<BR>promiscuous adultery), but <I>second
</I>that he was, owing to his mental disease,<BR>unable to realise
that his accusations were false and that accordingly his<BR>conduct
was wrong. It should be added that the Commissioner had no<BR>difficulty
in finding that the husband's course of conduct was in fact
injurious<BR>to his wife's health. The learned Commissioner expressed
the view that if<BR>the matter were <I>res integra </I>before him he
would hold that the second<BR>M'Naghten Rule had no application; but
he felt himself bound by authority<BR>to take a different view and he
therefore found that the wife's claim based<BR>on cruelty was
answered by the circumstance that the husband was unaware<BR>that
what he was doing was wrong. The Court of Appeal (by a
majority<BR>Willmer and Davies L.J.J., Donovan L.J. dissenting)
affirmed this conclusion<BR>following recent decisions of that Court.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">For myself
I confess that I can feel no doubt that the answer to the<BR>specific
question raised in the case is that the second M'Naghten Rule has<BR>no
application, with the consequence that the present appeal must
be<BR>allowed. It will be of some assistance in regard to what
follows if I<BR>briefly state the history of what I will call the
intrusion of the so-called<BR>M'Naghten Rules into divorce law. The
history may be said to begin with<BR>the case of <I>Hall </I>v. <I>Hall
</I>(3 Sw. &amp; Tr. 347) decided in the year 1864. In that<BR>case
Lord Penzance, though stating that intemperance and conduct of
that<BR>kind would be no answer to an allegation of cruelty, yet
thought that insanity<BR>might be a different matter. The question
did not arise again in the Reports<BR>until the case of <I>Hanbury </I>v.
<I>Hanbury </I>in the year 1892. In the result the<BR>question did
not call for decision, but in the Court of Appeal (8 T.L.R. 559)<BR>Lord
Esher, M.R., expressed the view that the case might well have
been<BR>different, that is to say, a petitioner might fail if it were
shown that the<BR>Respondent was unaware of the nature and quality of
what he was doing<BR>or alternatively, if he realized such nature and
quality, did not know that he<BR>was doing wrong. Though Lord Esher
made no reference in terms to the<BR>M'Naghten Rules the dictum to
which I have alluded was clearly a para-<BR>phrase of them. Again
there is a considerable interval until the year 1939<BR>(that is, two
years after the passing of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937)<BR>when
in the case of <I>Astle </I>v. <I>Astle </I>[1939] P. 415, the first
two M'Naghten<BR>Rules were for the first time specifically mentioned
and applied by Mr.<BR>Justice Henn Collins in reference to his
proposition that the word &quot; treated &quot;<BR>in the Act of 1937
denoted conscious action on the part of the person<BR>charged with
cruelty. The next date to mention is one of great importance,<BR>namely,
the year 1949 in which the case of <I>White </I>v. <I>White </I>came
before<BR>the Court of Appeal (see [1950] P. 39). Though in this
case, as in the case of<BR><I>Astle, </I>the petition in fact
succeeded, nevertheless Lord Justice Asquith in<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

of his judgment treated it as established that if the spouse<BR>charged
was unaware through insanity of the nature and quality of his acts<BR>it
would be a defence to the petition, and he added that if for such
a<BR>purpose the first of the M'Naghten Rules had been invoked it was
inevitable<BR>and logical that the second rule should also be
available, that is to say,<BR>that even if the spouse charged did
know the nature and quality of his acts<BR>he would have a defence
if, through insanity, he was able to establish that<BR>he was unaware
that what he was doing was wrong. This statement of<BR>Lord Justice
Asquith has since been followed in the Court of Appeal,<BR>particularly
in the two cases of <I>Swan </I>v. <I>Swan </I>[1953]<I> </I>P. 258,
and <I>Palmer </I>v.<BR><I>Palmer </I>[1955] P. 4. As my noble and
learned friend, Lord Reid, has pointed<BR>out, in none of the
reported cases has the application of these M'Naghten<BR>Rules or
either of them in fact so far provided a defence to the claim, but<BR>it
must be taken that during the past decade it has been accepted by
the<BR>Court of Appeal that both M'Naghten Rules are or may be
applicable in<BR>cases of divorce founded on charges of cruelty, and
it was this view which<BR>commended itself to the majority of the
Court in the present case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">As is well
known, the so-called M'Naghten Rules consisted of answers<BR>given by
the Judges to questions put to them by your Lordships' House
in<BR>reference to the proper direction to be given at a criminal
trial, and parti-<BR>cularly at a murder trial. My noble friend, Lord
Reid, has pointed out that<BR>of late the so-called Rules have not
been regarded as entirely satisfactory<BR>even in criminal cases&mdash;as
may indeed be illustrated by the passing of the<BR>Homicide Act,
1957. But, apart from such criticism, it is my opinion that<BR>the
Rules ought, as such, to have no application to divorce cases. It
was<BR>of the essence of the so-called Rules that they should be
invoked where the<BR>test for liability involved the existence of
<I>mens rea </I>(that is, a criminal mind)<BR>which by the common law
and in a great many cases of statutory offences is<BR>an essential
ingredient to a criminal act. Cruelty is not a crime. Therefore,<BR>as
it seems to me, it follows that <I>mens rea </I>as understood in our
law should<BR>not be regarded as being of its essence&mdash;any more
than it is generally<BR>so regarded in our civil law except in rare
cases as, for example, the tort<BR>of malicious destruction of
property. In any case, I should venture to think,<BR>with all respect
to those who take a different view, that the Rules, and
parti-<BR>cularly the second Rule, can have no application to a case
like the present<BR>Here the Respondent, Mr. Williams, was not doing
things which were <I>ex<BR>facie </I>criminal or analogous to
criminal acts. He was deliberately accusing his<BR>wife of adulterous
associations, but he thought such accusations were justified<BR>because
he believed that they were true, having been so induced to think
by<BR>voices which informed him of the fact.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It is,
however, clear that having regard to the arguments presented to
your<BR>Lordships it would not be regarded as a sufficient answer to
the present case<BR>merely to state that the second M'Naghten Rule
has here no application.<BR>The case and the arguments presented to
your Lordships' House have<BR>inevitably raised the general and
important question&mdash;to what extent is<BR>insanity an answer to a
plea of cruelty in a petition for divorce? I should<BR>here state
that in all that follows I shall assume that the petitioner is
able<BR>to establish injury to health or proper anticipation of such
injury. Such a<BR>premise is essential for the establishment of
cruelty, as was laid down by this<BR>House in the case of <I>Russell
</I>v. <I>Russell </I>[1897] A.C. 395. I have already stated<BR>that
in the present case the facts were found to establish such injury
or<BR>anticipated injury, and in all that follows I shall assume the
premise similarly<BR>established. The question whether cruelty is
established may be said to<BR>involve two extremes of view. On the
one hand it may be said that the<BR>question whether actions are &quot;
cruel &quot; must be judged wholly objectively, that<BR>is to say,
whether the actions complained of would be regarded by any<BR>reasonable
man if done by one ordinary person to another as being cruel<BR>to
the spouse affected. To take one of the illustrations given in the
Oxford<BR>Dictionary of the meaning of the word &quot; cruelty &quot;,
it was stated by an eminent<BR>writer of the last century that &quot;
' Tis brutal cruelty to make any jest of the<BR>&quot; weaknesses and
sufferings of the patients in a hospital&quot;. If, therefore,<BR>a
man is found in fact to be making jests of the weaknesses or
sufferings<BR>of patients in a hospital, will it be any defence to
the charge, will it, in<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

shewn<BR>that the jester is for any reason so insane as to be unaware
that he is making<BR>a jest or as to be unaware that the persons
against whom his remarks are<BR>directed are patients in a hospital?
On the extreme objective view the<BR>answer will be &quot; No &quot;.
On this view the behaviour of the man in question<BR>will be called
properly cruel whether he is really aware of what he is doing<BR>or
not. There is, however, another extreme view which essentially rests
upon<BR>the premise that the test of cruelty is subjective, that is
to say, that no one<BR>can properly be accused of cruelty unless
there is something opprobrious,<BR>something in his behaviour that
must be condemned as inexcusable, a test<BR>which, it is said, cannot
fairly be satisfied unless he is not only aware of<BR>what he is in
fact saying or doing but knows or ought to know that what<BR>he is
saying or doing is wrong or culpable. Put in another form, on<BR>this
view it is said that cruelty properly so called involves essentially
an<BR>element of malignity on the part of the person called cruel. On
this view<BR>it would mean that insanity, if it were such that the
actor was unaware<BR>of the nature and quality of his acts or thought
that such acts were justified&mdash;<BR>and I assume that if he in a
case such as the present accepted the truth<BR>of the hallucinations

of the word ''cruel&quot; to the actor's conduct.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">A
reference to the very many cases cited shews that the problem
has<BR>been much vexed by what I venture to call quasi-philosophical
discussions<BR>upon certain other and related questions:   for
example, whether in order<BR>to establish cruelty the acts must in
some real sense be &quot; aimed at &quot; the person<BR>affected, and
the related question  (if indeed it is not the same
question<BR>differently expressed) to what extent must there on the
part of the actor be<BR>an &quot; intention &quot; to hurt (or at
least to do acts which hurt) whether such<BR>intention be conscious
or deliberate or in some cases presumed: for, as the<BR>decisions
show, the Courts have been compelled in the interests of justice<BR>and
applied common sense to expand the requisite of intention so as
to<BR>include  presumed   intention   (the  presumption   being 
sometimes  regarded<BR>as compelling only and sometimes as
conclusive) and thereby to add greatly<BR>to what I have called the
quasi-philosophical discussion upon the subject and<BR>therefore to
its difficulty and uncertainty.   It is no doubt true that in
some<BR>cases, applying the ordinary standards of sense and language,
proof of a<BR>deliberate intention on the part of the actor to hurt
may be highly relevant<BR>in deciding whether his conduct amounts to
cruelty.    But, save in such<BR>&quot; borderline &quot; cases, my
view is that the problems whether the conduct<BR>challenged was &quot;
aimed at&quot; the person affected or was (or should  be<BR>treated
as) &quot; intentional &quot; do not properly arise in the
jurisdiction with which<BR>we are now concerned, and I venture to
think that their presence and the<BR>discussions of them in many of
the cases has served seriously to cloud the<BR>law.   We are here
concerned with the formula stated in the Act of 1937,<BR>&quot;has
treated with cruelty&quot;.   True it is that before 1937 the formula
was<BR>(as it now is in Scotland) &quot; guilty of cruelty &quot;.  
As my noble and learned<BR>friend, Lord Reid, has pointed out, the
formula &quot; guilty of cruelty &quot; was<BR>applicable before 1937
to a claim for judicial separation.    In my opinion<BR>it is
impossible to suppose that Parliament in 1937 intended that &quot;
cruelty &quot;<BR>as a ground for divorce should have a different
significance from that<BR>appropriate to the older remedy of judicial
separation.    To my mind the<BR>variation in the formulation makes
no real difference.   The use of the word<BR>&quot; guilty &quot;
does not, as it seems to me, import the essentials of crime any<BR>more
than it does in such a common context as &quot;guilty of
negligence&quot;.<BR>The phrase &quot; has been guilty of cruelty &quot;
means no more and no less than<BR>&quot; has acted cruelly to the
person making the charge &quot;; in other words, has<BR>been cruel to
him or her.   The formula is therefore in truth the same as that<BR>now
involved in the Act, &quot; has treated with cruelty.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I
therefore conceive that the first essential thing is to decide what
is meant<BR>by the word &quot; cruelty &quot;. The word is one of
common use and is defined as<BR>meaning &quot; delight in or
indifference to pain or misery in others &quot;. I observe<BR>at once
that there is therefore inevitably involved the case, which must
indeed<BR>be common if perhaps not the most common of all cases,
where the conduct<BR>is founded not on delight in the pain of others
but in indifference. The<BR>cases indeed shew clearly enough that so
often the spouse charged with cruelty<BR>is doing little else than
indulge his or her own purely selfish desires or instincts.<BR>It
follows, therefore, in my opinion, that this essential meaning of the
word<BR>must dispose of the argument involved in the proposition that
the so-called<BR>cruel acts must in some sense be &quot; aimed at&quot;
the other party concerned.<BR>If a man's acts are founded on
stupidity or on disregard of anyone else or<BR>of anything but his
own self-interest, it is clear that he nonetheless may<BR>fairly and
properly be guilty of cruelty. On this simple ground,
therefore<BR>(though I do not forget the type of case already
mentioned when the presence<BR>of deliberate intention on the actor's
part to hurt may be decisive in deter-<BR>mining whether his conduct
is fairly to be described as cruel), I would reject<BR>entirely the
notion that &quot; aiming at&quot; the injured party or intention to
hurt<BR>on the actor's part is an essential of cruelty. And I am
assisted to that<BR>conclusion because of the necessity in any event
for the injured party to<BR>prove that his or her health has been in
fact affected or that he or she may<BR>fairly apprehend such
result&mdash;in other words, that acts or conduct of the<BR>party
charged have, whatever the aim or lack of aim, hit the other
spouse.<BR>Force, as I venture to think, is given to this conclusion
by considering such<BR>phrases &quot; treated with stupidity &quot;
or &quot; treated with disrespect &quot;. It is not,<BR>as I venture
to think, essentially inherent in either phrase that there was any<BR>&quot;
intention &quot; on the part of the person said to have treated
another with either<BR>stupidity or disrespect. I am also for my part
unable to accept the view that<BR>there must be present in order to
constitute cruelty any conscious moral<BR>obliquity. There is nothing
in the word &quot; cruelty &quot; or in the formula chosen<BR>by
Parliament to suggest such a thing, and (as Donovan, L.J., pointed
out in<BR>his dissenting judgment in the present case) it would have
been easy for<BR>Parliament so to provide if it had been intended
that it should be of the<BR>essence of cruelty for the purposes of
the Act either that there should be<BR>deliberate intention or that
there should be moral obliquity on the part of the<BR>actor. I would
add that if intention (whether actual or presumed) be intro-<BR>duced
it must in any event be subject to some qualification such as &quot;
without<BR>lawful excuse &quot;. This is shewn if the example be
taken of a policeman<BR>attempting to arrest a fugitive criminal. In
such cases the policeman may<BR>justifiably inflict some injury upon
the person who is seeking to evade<BR>arrest. No doubt if the
policeman exceeded what was reasonably necessary<BR>or proper for the
performance of his duty he might expose himself to the<BR>charge that
his action had been cruel. But if he did inflict injury properly<BR>in
the execution of his duty he could not fairly be called cruel though
it<BR>would be clear that the injury inflicted would be rightly
regarded as<BR>intentional.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In the
circumstances, it is indeed tempting to say that the test is in
all<BR>cases purely objective. If a man is seen to be beating his
wife, his child<BR>or his dog, the question would be whether
according to the judgment of a<BR>reasonable man who saw the
performance the actor would fairly be said<BR>to be treating his
wife, his child or his dog with cruelty? There is, however,<BR>the
difficulty at once presented to this simple view, namely, if in truth
the man<BR>accused of cruelty is through insanity quite unaware of
what he is doing,<BR>can he fairly be said to be acting cruelly at
all any more than it could fairly<BR>be said of a sleep-walker who
inflicted some injury upon a child or a kitten<BR>or puppy in his
sleep was cruel? It was the view of Donovan, L.J., that<BR>the use of
the word &quot; treated &quot; does in some sense involve knowledge
on<BR>the part of the actor of what he is doing. Moreover, as I have
already<BR>observed, it seems in England from the year 1864 to have
been consistently<BR>suggested by the judges that the acts of a
madman should be differently<BR>treated from acts done in the heat of
passion or intemperance. In other<BR>words, it may be said to have

decision in this matter rested with me alone I am disposed to<BR>think
that I should take the view that, upon the ordinary sense of
language,<BR>a man could not and would not be said to be treating
another with cruelty<BR>if he was shewn, by reason of mental disease
or infirmity, not to be at all<BR>aware of what he was doing&mdash;if,
to take an extreme case, a man who was<BR>observed to be beating
physically his wife with the utmost severity were<BR>proved to be
quite unaware that he was doing other than beating his<BR>drawing-room
rug. Upon this particular question it may strictly not be<BR>necessary
for me to express any concluded opinion. But, as I have
earlier<BR>stated, the nature and extent of the arguments presented
to your Lordships<BR>have undoubtedly raised, and raised before your
Lordships' House for the<BR>first time, the whole question of the
extent to which insanity may be an<BR>answer to petition for relief
in a matrimonial cause based upon an allega-<BR>tion of cruelty ; and
upon this question two of your Lordships take one<BR>view, and two of
your Lordships another. In the circumstances I have felt<BR>it my
duty to express a conclusion consistent with one or other of
the<BR>divergent views which your Lordships entertain. I therefore
conclude,<BR>though I confess with some hesitation, that the test
whether one charged with<BR>treating his or her spouse with cruelty
is to be applied wholly objectively<BR>and therefore that proof of
insanity (that is, proof that he or she was unaware<BR>through mental
disease or disorder of the nature and quality of his or her<BR>acts)
is not necessarily an answer to the charge. I say deliberately &quot;
not<BR>&quot; necessarily&quot;. The mental derangement of the person
charged cannot,<BR>as I think, be wholly disregarded&mdash;certainly
where the sufferer is himself<BR>or herself aware of the disorder.
But the test will be still objective&mdash;in<BR>all the
circumstances of the case should it fairly be said that the
spouse<BR>charged has treated the other with cruelty? As I have said,
since the matter<BR>will be judged objectively, <I>prima facie </I>the
insanity of the person charged<BR>will not disable an affirmative
answer being given to the question. Beyond<BR>that, however, I would
for myself prefer not to go ; for there may be instances<BR>where in
all the circumstances of the case the objective observer would
say<BR>that the conduct complained of was not in truth cruel. I do,
however,<BR>conclude that generally speaking the conduct of the party
charged will not<BR>fail to be properly described as cruel merely
because he or she is unaware of<BR>the nature and quality of his or
her conduct. Certainly if the conduct is<BR>regarded from the point
of view of the sufferer it would not, in the ordinary<BR>case, be
said that he or she was not cruelly treated; or indeed that the
party<BR>charged did not in fact act cruelly though no doubt
(unhappily) he or she was<BR>through insanity morally blameless. In
reaching eventually this conclusion<BR>I have in mind the point made
by my noble and learned friend. Lord Reid,<BR>that a distinction may
otherwise unfairly and illogically be drawn between<BR>one kind of
insanity and another&mdash;to the serious detriment of the
sufferer&mdash;<BR>that is, between the case of the man or woman who
through insanity does<BR>not know the nature or quality of his or her
acts and the man or woman who,<BR>though aware of the nature and
quality of his or her acts, nevertheless<BR>through mental disease or
disorder genuinely is unaware that they are<BR>unjustifiable. I add,
too, that the emphasis given in the older cases (as pointed<BR>out by
my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid) to the need to give
protection<BR>to the suffering spouse has certainly not been
qualified by the fact in the<BR>present day and age that the break-up
of a marriage is regarded much less<BR>seriously than it was a
hundred years ago.</FONT></FONT></P>

whatever be the true and just answer to the question whether
a<BR>husband or wife has treated his or her spouse with cruelty if he
or she is<BR>through insanity unaware of the nature and quality of
the acts complained<BR>of, I confess that I have no doubt that it can
be no answer to a charge of<BR>cruelty on his or her part that,
knowing the nature and quality of his or her<BR>acts, he or she is,
through insanity, unaware that those acts are wrong. In<BR>other
words, if the person charged with cruelty knows what he is
doing,<BR>knows, that is to say, the nature and quality of his acts,
then it is for the<BR>court or the jury to say whether the other
party has in truth been cruelly<BR>treated thereby, and it will be no
answer for the actor to say that he did what<BR>he did or failed to
do what he ought to have done because he was justified<BR>on account
of some hallucinations based on insanity or because he other-<BR>wise
did in truth assume the facts to be such as would or might have
justified<BR>his conduct. In such event it does seem to me that even
if the test of<BR>inexcusability be applied his or her conduct will
truly and fairly be said<BR>to be inexcusable though it may perhaps
be explicable.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I add
finally this, if it be said upon a true view that there must be
some<BR>element of opprobrium, if there must on the part of the
person charged be<BR>something which fairly can be said to be
conscious and deliberate wrong-<BR>doing, then where does the matter
end? As it seems to me, it cannot be<BR>said fairly to end by
considering matters merely of insanity. Suppose the<BR>case be taken
of one who is a devotee of some extreme religious dogma<BR>honestly
and conscientiously held. For example, suppose the case of a man<BR>of
such strict puritan views that he firmly believes that one who uses
bad<BR>language is inevitably condemned to hell. He hears a child use
some swear<BR>word, and in the belief that he will thereby be saving
and cannot otherwise<BR>save the child from perdition, he then
inflicts upon the child the most<BR>severe caning or other physical
punishment. Can it be denied on the part<BR>of the person so behaving
that his conduct has been cruel because (as he<BR>says and honestly
says) such conduct is based upon some extreme but<BR>sincerely held
religious view? In other words, as I venture to think, it
is<BR>impossible to stop at cases of insanity; and when questions of
cruelty arise<BR>problems of the kind which I have mentioned will
inevitably also arise,<BR>thereby adding to the law not only an
altogether undesirable refinement<BR>but also a departure, as I
think, from the ordinary sense and meaning of the<BR>language which
Parliament has thought fit to use.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">to ask
whether it can be in any way justified. In the present case the<BR>main
issue has by both sides been formulated as being whether insanity<BR>is
a defence to a charge of cruelty in matrimonial causes. So
formulated<BR>there is implicit a suggestion that in a judicial
investigation in a cruelty case<BR>the acts complained of may first
be isolated so that it may be decided<BR>whether they should be
characterised as cruel and that it should then be<BR>decided whether
the defence of insanity can be deployed. Such an approach<BR>seems to
me to be undesirable and to be contrary to the guidance given<BR>in
<I>King </I>v. <I>King. </I>Any questions which arise concerning the
mental health<BR>of the parties should in my view be regarded as
relevant and integral parts<BR>of the inquiry as to whether one
spouse has treated the other with cruelty.<BR>If there is insanity it
is a fact which is to be taken into account. Insanity<BR>does not,
therefore, come in as a &quot;defence&quot;: it comes in because it
is a<BR>fact and a circumstance which may loom large in any true and
complete<BR>narrative of the events which are under review in an
inquiry as to whether<BR>one person has treated another with cruelty.
When human conduct is being<BR>assessed all its features, it would
seem, possess relevancy. In their dealings<BR>with each other human
beings recognise that there are occasions when in<BR>justice and
humanity allowances must be made. I cannot think that it<BR>would be
helpful ever to seek to catalogue or to define such occasions. Nor<BR>do
I think that it would be desirable to confine the conception of
cruelty<BR>within precisely defined limits. If a jury is asked to say
whether one spouse<BR>has treated the other With cruelty the task
should not be beyond the com-<BR>petence of just-minded and
reasonable persons who, though lacking know-<BR>ledge of decided
cases, have an equipment of commonsense derived from a<BR>knowledge
of human nature and of the ways of the world.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In such an
inquiry some questions which arise can be answered with<BR>prompt and
assured confidence although a full explanation of the exact<BR>stages
of reasoning which warrant the answer may require skill in
exposition,<BR>analysis and expression. But it is the answer that is
important for the<BR>parties: a jury would be called upon to give the
answer but do not give<BR>their reasons. If a devoted spouse by some
quite unintentional mishap in<BR>the home caused severe personal
injury to the other&mdash;no one would be likely<BR>to assert that
the one had treated the other with cruelty. The same view<BR>would be
likely to be taken even if the unintentional mishap was occasioned<BR>by
carelessness. The statute does not in terms say that &quot; accident&quot;
is a<BR>&quot; defence &quot;. It need not do so because anyone
called upon to decide whether<BR>one person has treated another with
cruelty would naturally and without<BR>question consider it to be
highly relevant to know whether an occurrence<BR>was accidental. If
one spouse while genuinely asleep unwittingly caused<BR>severe
personal injury to the other, it would be unlikely that anyone
would<BR>say that the former had treated the latter with cruelty. If
one spouse in<BR>a state of self-induced but complete intoxication
caused severe personal<BR>injury to the other different
considerations might apply. So also some<BR>isolated incident might
be viewed in one way and a series of incidents might<BR>be viewed in
another. I would think, therefore, that there is no touchstone<BR>by
which to appraise conduct. In <I>Thomas </I>v. <I>Thomas, </I>1947
S.C. (H.L.)<BR>45, 55, Lord Thankerton said: &quot; The law has no
footrule by which to<BR>&quot; measure the personalities of the
spouses.&quot; In some cases one approach<BR>may be apposite though
in others it would not. In some cases one test may<BR>be adequate
while in others it will not be. In <I>King </I>v. <I>King (supra)
</I>Lord<BR>Normand (at p. 129) said: &quot; I have no doubt that the
test whether the con-<BR>&quot;duct was wilful and unjustifiable, as
well as injurious, was an adequate<BR>&quot; test for what remained
to be decided in <I>Horton's </I>case. What is open to<BR>&quot;
question is whether it can be taken to be an adequate test in all
cases<BR>&quot; of cruelty by nagging accusation. I think it is not
always an adequate test,<BR>&quot; and that Bucknill, J. did not put
it forward as a universal and exhaustive<BR>&quot; test in this type
of case. The general rule in all questions of cruelty is<BR>&quot;
that the whole matrimonial relations must be considered, and that
rule<BR>&quot; is of special value when the cruelty consists not of
violent acts but of<BR>&quot; injurious reproaches, complaints,
accusations or taunts. Wilful accusa-<BR>&quot; tions may be made
which are not true and for which there are no probable<BR>&quot;
grounds, and yet they may not amount to cruelty. To take an obvious<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

example, they may have been provoked by the cruel conduct of the
other<BR>&quot; spouse. There is in many cases no easy rule, no clear
line of demarca-<BR>&quot; tion which divides cruelty from something
which does not amount to<BR>&quot; cruelty. The issue may become one
of great difficulty in which the decision<BR>&quot; must be largely a
matter of the discretion of the judge who saw and heard<BR>&quot; the
witnesses and who has considered the conduct of both parties, and<BR>&quot;
the whole circumstances in relation to the temperament and character
of the<BR>&quot; respondent spouse. If the trial judge in the
exercise of this discretion<BR>&quot; comes to the conclusion that
the conduct of the respondent is, notwith-<BR>&quot; standing the
provocation received or the difficulties and stresses endured,<BR>&quot;
really an inexcusable offence against the other spouse, his judgment
should<BR>&quot; be respected and treated as conclusive. I have used
the word ' inexcusable ',<BR>&quot; but ' unpardonable', or '
unforgivable ' or ' grossly excessive' would<BR>&quot; equally convey
what I mean.&quot; Later on in his speech Lord Normand<BR>referred to
the temperaments of the spouses in that case and said (see p.
131)<BR>that &quot;both parties had great need of forbearance&quot;:
he said (see p. 133)<BR>that the husband had &quot;behaved with great
want of consideration&quot;: he<BR>said (see p. 133): &quot;They were
both blameworthy and each was guilty of<BR>&quot; behaviour which,
considered without reference to the behaviour of the<BR>&quot; other,
might be regarded as cruel.&quot; All this serves to illustrate that
in<BR>a cruelty case the conduct of both parties falls to be assessed
as well as every-<BR>thing that is relevant to &quot; the temperament
and character of the respondent<BR>&quot; spouse &quot;. In his
speech in the same case my noble and learned friend,<BR>Lord Reid,
said: &quot; I do not intend to try to define cruelty. I doubt
whether<BR>&quot; any definition would apply equally well to cases
where there has been<BR>&quot; physical violence and to cases of
nagging, or to cases where there has been<BR>&quot; a deliberate
intention to hurt and to cases where temperament and unfor-<BR>&quot;
tunate circumstances have caused much of the trouble. But in cases
like<BR>&quot; the present the wife's conduct must at least be
inexcusable after taking<BR>&quot; everything into consideration.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">My Lords,
applying these tests I consider that the factor of illness may<BR>often
be highly relevant in assessing whether conduct has been cruel. 
What<BR>someone does while in a state of automatism may not
unreasonably be<BR>said not to be that person's action at all.   What
someone does while suffering<BR>from a raging physical fever might be
regarded as &quot; excusable &quot;.    Is what<BR>someone does while
suffering from that form of illness which dethrones<BR>reason and
withdraws the power of control to be regarded as &quot; inexcusable
&quot;?<BR>I cannot think that physical illness should be regarded as
relevant but that<BR>mental illness should be regarded as irrelevant.
  Evidence concerning illness<BR>may be of high consequence in any
survey which is designed to give that<BR>complete picture of domestic
life against the background of which judgment<BR>is formed as to
whether one spouse has treated the other with cruelty.   In<BR>his
speech in <I>Thomas </I>v. <I>Thomas (supra) </I>Lord Simonds
approved of the<BR>&quot; clear recognition &quot; which he discerned
in the judgment of the Lord Ordinary<BR>of the fact that &quot; the
picture of the domestic lives of this man and woman<BR>&quot; must be
surveyed as a whole before a true judgment can be formed of<BR>&quot;
their possible future relations &quot;.   Lord du Parcq, in speaking
in that case<BR>of an assault which had taken place, said (at p. 63):
 &quot; The assault must<BR>&quot; be viewed not as an isolated fact,
but in its setting, as an incident in a<BR>&quot; complicated series
of marital relations.   The intent and the mental condi-<BR>&quot;
tion of the spouse against whom cruelty is alleged are always
important<BR>&quot; considerations.&quot;   He further said: &quot;
The fact that the defender was suffer-<BR>&quot; ing from a form of
ill health likely to affect her conduct is not to be<BR>&quot;
regarded as telling against her.    I would not suggest that illness
ought<BR>&quot; to be accepted as an excuse for cruelty, but when it
is necessary to appre-<BR>&quot; ciate the quality of an act or a
course of conduct, as it is when the grave<BR>&quot; accusation of
<I>saevitia </I>is made, the law does not forbid a judge to have<BR>&quot;
regard to any physical or mental strain under which the accused

who<BR>enjoys normal physical and mental health will be judged by any
such test<BR>as may be applicable having regard to the facts of the
particular case.   Some<BR>acts may follow a declared express
intention to be cruel.   Some acts may be<BR>such as to reveal or to
make it proper to infer an intention to be cruel.<BR>In other cases
there may be no such wilful intention but a complete failure,<BR>either
from indifference or obtuseness, to appreciate that conduct is

that there could be cases where<BR>a spouse needed protection but
could get neither decree of dissolution nor<BR>decree of judicial
separation. Such a consideration does not affect the<BR>present

was<BR>not necessary to prove that acts of cruelty were caused by
actual malignity.<BR>Thus in <I>Kirkman </I>v. <I>Kirkman </I>in 1807
(1 Hag. Con. 409) Sir William Scott<BR>referred to a suggestion that
the wife's acts of violence were caused by<BR>jealousy and he said: &quot;
All the evidence tends to establish that there was no<BR>&quot;
foundation, in the conduct of the husband, for feelings of that
nature.<BR>&quot; If such feelings were entertained, with or without
reason, jealousy is a<BR>&quot; passion producing effects as violent
as any other passion and there will<BR>&quot; be the same necessity

appear to proceed from malignity.&quot; That the refer-<BR>ence to &quot;
violent and disorderly affections of the mind &quot; was not
understood<BR>as a reference to insanity is, I think, shown by the
later case of <I>Hall </I>v. <I>Hall<BR></I>(1864) 3; Sw. &amp; Tr.

in a field in which your Lordships are free to direct the right<BR>path
I would be well content to be guided by the clear light of
this<BR>judgment delivered nearly one hundred years ago. Here also is
simplicity<BR>of expression. If the conduct complained of &quot;
proceeded from &quot; madness,<BR>dementia, or positive disease of
the mind it should not be classed as cruelty.<BR>Here also is the
justness of this approach explained. &quot; An insane man is<BR>&quot;
likely enough to be dangerous to his wife's personal safety, but the
remedy<BR>&quot; lies in the restraint of the husband, not the
release of the wife. Though<BR>&quot; the object of this Court's
interference is safety for the future, its sentence<BR>&quot; carries
with it some retribution for the past. In either aspect it would<BR>&quot;
be equally unjust to act on the excesses of a disordered brain: in
the<BR>&quot; latter, for the instance are not responsible ; in the
former, for insanity may<BR>&quot; be cured, and the danger at an

Reference may also be made<BR>to <I>Hayward </I>v. <I>Hayward </I>(1858)
1 Sw. &amp; Tr. 81, in which case in a wife's suit<BR>for restitution
the Judge Ordinary said: &quot; If this lady at the time alleged<BR>&quot;
concealed a dagger or a knife, intending to do violence to her
husband,<BR>&quot; being insane, and she turns out to be insane, I
find no authority for holding<BR>&quot; that that is an answer to a
claim for restitution of conjugal rights. A<BR>&quot; husband is not
entitled to turn a lunatic wife out of doors. He may be<BR>&quot;
rather bound to place her in proper custody, under proper care, but
he is<BR>&quot; not entitled to turn her out of his house. He is less
than ever justified<BR>&quot; in putting her away, if she has the
misfortune to be insane. On the other<BR>&quot; hand, she insists she
is not insane, and if her assertion can be established,<BR>&quot; she
would be responsible for those acts of violence, and her husband
would<BR>&quot; be justified in refusing to receive her, or in using
force to restrain her.&quot; In<BR>the Scottish case of <I>Steuart </I>v.

the view that I have formed is that it is undesirable to seek<BR>to
use any set form of words or any formula by which to measure
whether<BR>someone who is mentally afflicted has treated another with
cruelty. The<BR>M'Naghten Rules may often be helpful. If they are
being referred to as<BR>useful guides I can see no justification for
picking on some one of them to the<BR>exclusion of others. To say
that no heed should be paid to any consequence<BR>of insanity other
than that of not knowing what one is doing seems to me<BR>to be a
wholly unwarrantable limitation. Ultimately, however, the question<BR>is
a question of fact which is to be decided as a fair-minded reasonable
jury<BR>would decide it. If someone who in common parlance was
plainly mad did<BR>some act while not knowing what he was doing I do
not think that a jury would<BR>say that he was guilty of cruelty.
Likewise if someone who was plainly mad<BR>did some outrageous thing
and said that he had done it under divine direc-<BR>tion a jury would
not be likely to say that he was guilty of cruelty. A<BR>jury would
be likely to think, as the Judge Ordinary thought in <I>Hall v.
Hall,<BR></I>that it would be &quot; unjust &quot; to condemn someone
whose conduct resulted from<BR>&quot; the excesses of a disordered
brain &quot;. They would be likely to think (as<BR>did the Judge
Ordinary) that insanity is a form of illness and that a cure may<BR>be
effected.</FONT></FONT></P>

reasoning in <I>Hall v.<BR>Hall. </I>I notice such expressions as&mdash;&quot;
such unsoundness of mind as to make<BR>&quot; it impossible or at
least unreasonable to say that he was guilty of cruelty &quot;,<BR>and
&quot; The defender was not able to exert his reason to control his
reactions<BR>&quot; in the normal way.&quot; Though I refer to these
passages I am very averse<BR>from seeking to select any set of words
which could be regarded as a rigid<BR>or complete test. It has been
pointed out that in directing juries in criminal<BR>cases in regard
to the onus of proof which lies upon the prosecution it is
the<BR>essence and spirit of the matter that must be conveyed and
explained. There<BR>is no magic in the mouthing of some phrase or
formula. So here. Did the<BR>conduct complained of proceed from and
was it caused by madness? Did<BR>the conduct result from the excesses
of a disordered brain? Was the Respon-<BR>dent responsible for what
he did? Did he know what he was doing?<BR>Even if he knew what he was
doing was he so affected by his abnormal<BR>mental condition that it
caused him to act in a way that someone of normal<BR>mental condition
would not have acted? Was there such a defect of reason<BR>due to
disease of the mind that it would be unreasonable and unjust to<BR>say
that the Respondent had treated the petitioner with cruelty? Were
the<BR>Respondent's actions the result of insane delusions due to
disease of the<BR>mind (see the fourth question put to the Judges in

symptoms of and were they carried out under<BR>the influence of
insanity? Was the Respondent labouring under a defect<BR>of reason

insanity would suffice as a defence, recognising no doubt that, as
has been<BR>said, it is hard to determine when twilight becomes

insanity must at all events not<BR>fall short of such insanity as
would afford a defence to a criminal charge<BR>within the M'Naghten
Rules. &quot; In other words &quot;, he said, &quot; if the actor<BR>&quot;

conduct was so irrational that it was obvious to the injured party
that the<BR>conduct was not cruelty but was due to mental disease,
insanity was no<BR>defence to a charge of cruelty. Bucknill, L.J. did
not express any concluded<BR>opinion. In 1951 my noble and learned

cannot<BR>avoid the conclusion that the word &quot; cruelty &quot; of
itself involves an implica-<BR>tion of blameworthiness. Indeed, I
agree with Asquith, L.J. in thinking<BR>that if insanity is
immaterial it would appear to follow that the intention<BR>of the
aggressor is irrelevant, for the act must then be looked at from
the<BR>point of view of the victim and one looks no further than
that. If cruelty<BR>is to be excused by insanity, that is because
intention is relevant and the<BR>effect of insanity is to negative
intention. True that there must be degrees<BR>of mental illness
falling short of insanity, as there are of other maladies<BR>from
which the person charged with cruelty may be suffering. In such<BR>cases
allowance must be made for the condition of the sick person, as
I<BR>think all would agree, but once the line is crossed and a
condition of com-<BR>plete insanity is reached the question is not
what allowance must be made<BR>but whether a defence has been made
out. It is in this way that I under-<BR>stand the observation of
Asquith, L.J. to the effect that the presence of<BR>insanity &quot;

to create an artificial subdivision of cruelty which<BR>I think is

second branch or its equivalent is required to cover the case<BR>of
one who is conscious of what he is doing but through disease of the

those cases<BR>when through his insanity a person has no power of

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I cannot
accept the argument that divorce is partly punitive and
should,<BR>therefore, look to the criminal law for guidance. The
dissolution or<BR>permanent interruption of a union which is in
theory life-long and indissoluble<BR>cannot be justified by any
logic. But the frailties of humanity produce<BR>various situations
which demand practical relief, and the Divorce Acts owe<BR>their
origin to a merciful appreciation of that demand. Any extension<BR>of
the area of relief has always been advocated on the ground that
there<BR>are situations of hardship that must be alleviated, and has
been contested<BR>on the ground that to extend relief would create
corresponding hardship to<BR>the other party and would weaken the
important and sacred institution of<BR>matrimony. Never does an
intention to punish enter into the debate; nor<BR>is an extension of
the grounds of divorce ever advocated or opposed on the<BR>ground
that it will extend the area of punishment of errant spouses. It
is<BR>true that the divorce law of England, following the
ecclesiastical law, is<BR>founded on the concept of the matrimonial
offence. That concept is used<BR>to give some justification for
breaking an indissoluble union against the will<BR>of the offending
party. But in the Divorce Acts there is nothing that suggests<BR>an
intention to punish. If relief is to be granted, each party alike
must<BR>forfeit the status of matrimony or, in the case of
separation, part of that<BR>status. One party loses it voluntarily,
the other involuntarily, but the loss<BR>is inherent in the granting
of relief. A guilty husband may have to pay<BR>maintenance but only
in so far as necessity or fairness demands on a con-<BR>sideration of
the means of both parties; and punitive considerations are<BR>excluded.
Even when a co-respondent pays damages for breaking up a<BR>marriage,
an apt occasion for punishment, the damages are confined
to<BR>compensation for the loss suffered by the husband and are not
punitive.<BR>Costs are no more punitive than in any other branch of
the law; they are<BR>in fact less punitive in that for economic
reasons a husband who has done<BR>no wrong may be ordered to pay the
costs of his erring wife, and rarely is<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

of the wife whose exceptionally strong and loving character<BR>is
able to regard endurance of the cruelty resulting from the husband's

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The less
robust and more normal wife is in an unenviable position. The<BR>fact
that cruelty comes from mental disorder may to a very few make it
more<BR>tolerable. To the majority it will increase their
apprehensions, since there<BR>is no limit to which it might not go.
If the husband is sufficiently insane<BR>and is therefore to be given
immunity for his acts of cruelty (and also in con-<BR>sequence for
his acts of constructive desertion) but yet is not so
continuously<BR>insane as to be detained permanently, it is at the
very least doubtful, as<BR>the law now stands, if she has any &quot;
reasonable cause &quot; within the meaning<BR>of the Acts for not
living with him. If the wife leaves, she will probably<BR>be in
desertion and without home or maintenance. It may be that the<BR>Court
has a discretion and need not make a restitution order against
her,<BR>but the sole authority for this is the case of <I>Timmins </I>v.
<I>Timmins </I>[1953]<BR>2 All E.R. 187, in which there is a powerful
dissenting judgment by Hodson,<BR>L.J. (as my noble and learned
friend then was). It may be that she can<BR>claim that she is &quot;
separated by necessity &quot;, as a sailor's wife is during
his<BR>duties at sea (see <I>Lilley </I>v. <I>Lilley </I>[1959] 3 All
E.R. 283 at page 289 D ; but<BR>see also at page 291 F) and can
therefore obtain maintenance. But this is a<BR>difficult matter and
depends on her paying lip service at least to a willingness<BR>to
return whenever it may be sate to do so, whereas the truth may well
be<BR>that alter her ordeal she is not prepared to do so in any
event. Under the<BR>Guardianship of Infants Act she can obtain
custody of the children and<BR>maintenance for them, but without
maintenance for herself she would not<BR>be able to support a home.
She may, as sometimes happens in these cases,<BR>find some other man
to help and support her and her children. She will<BR>then live with
him in the hope that she may one day obtain release under<BR>subsection
l(d) asking the Court for the exercise of its discretion, which in<BR>my
experience of such cases has never been refused.</FONT></FONT></P>

position is thus unhappy and at the best very precarious. There is<BR>no
great alleviation in the fact that in live years she may possibly
obtain a<BR>divorce on the ground of incurable insanity. The husband
may not be pro-<BR>nounced incurable or there may be interruptions in
his period of detention<BR>that will defeat a petition. Attempts by
the doctors to cure the patient<BR>may well lead to such
interruptions and in their attempts any consequent<BR>hardship to the
wife will rightly be disregarded. Moreover, to a wife so<BR>placed
five years will seem a long time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I accept
that in practice, perhaps in the majority of cases where
serious<BR>cruelty has been inflicted, the respondent will by the
time of the trial be<BR>under detention and that in upwards of live
years the petitioner may possibly<BR>be able to obtain a divorce
under section 1 (d). But if insanity be a defence,<BR>it cannot be
waived in cases where it creates purposeless hardship. The<BR>judge
must investigate it, even if it is not raised, and must, if the
defence<BR>appears good, refuse a decree to a petitioner however long
suffering. The<BR>defence will normally be in the hands of the
Official Solicitor, and he will<BR>be bound to plead insanity and
call evidence in support of it where it appears<BR>to be the cause of
the cruelty.</FONT></FONT></P>

these hardships on the wife's side one must balance the hardships<BR>of
the husband. These are indeed heavy. He will lose his marriage to<BR>a
wife whom he may love. But that is a misfortune which ex

these scales. The<BR>question here is whether it is really a greater
hardship to be severed from<BR>her by divorce than to be tied to her
in a marriage which this wife finds<BR>intolerable, which makes this
wife ill, and from which she wishes to be free.<BR>In my opinion it
is not. The real hardship to the husband would be that<BR>he was
found guilty of cruelty when, apart from his illness, he may be
a<BR>kindly man. It is fairly argued that he should not be asked to
bear that<BR>stigma. But it must be remembered that in the majority

That Act did not<BR>introduce any alteration of the law of cruelty
previously in force (see<BR><I>Jamieson </I>v. <I>Jamieson </I>[1952]
A.C. 525). For the reasons set out by the<BR>majority in the case of

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I agree
with Donovan, L.J. when he said in the present case in the<BR>Court
of Appeal ([1962] 2 W.L.R. 977 at page 992): &quot;If Parliament
had<BR>&quot; intended that the defence put forward in the present
case should be a valid<BR>&quot; defence to a petition for divorce
based on cruelty, it would have been simple<BR>&quot; so to provide,
and I should have expected it to have been done in explicit<BR>&quot;
terms. I cannot think that Parliament would have left it to be
implied<BR>&quot; from the mere words ' has treated the petitioner
with cruelty'. . . . In<BR>&quot; particular, in the case of a man
who intends to do something, and does<BR>&quot; it, knowing what he
is doing, the word ' treated' does not, in my opinion,<BR>&quot;
imply that he must be able to form a sound judgment upon the
question<BR>&quot; whether his act is right or wrong. If one looks no
further than the words<BR>&quot; of the statute, I think they afford
the husband no defence. The word<BR>&quot; ' cruelty' of itself does
not assist in this respect. It connotes acts which<BR>&quot; give
unnecessary pain to others, or which are savage or inhuman or<BR>&quot;
merciless, but it certainly does not carry with it the implication
that<BR>&quot; the doer is conscious that his acts are wrong.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Moreover,
in my opinion, insanity should not constitute a defence to<BR>suits
based on cruelty, even when a man did not know the nature of
his<BR>acts. Suppose that an insane man inflicted some cruel torture
on his<BR>wife not knowing what he was doing. To the question &quot;
Did he treat his<BR>&quot; wife with cruelty'&quot;? no jury would, I
venture to think, answer &quot; No &quot;.<BR>Their answer would be &quot;
Yes &quot;, but they would add a rider that the man<BR>was insane at
the time and did not know what he was doing. The first<BR>part of the
answer would appear to justify the Court in giving a decree<BR>unless
the rider, on an objective view of the circumstances and
parties,<BR>removed the act from the area of cruelty.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
argument for holding that a man should not be held to have<BR>treated
his wife with cruelty if he did not know what he was doing has<BR>an
attractive simplicity. But so to hold would create a dividing line
which<BR>in practice is not easy to apply (even with medical help)
which will at<BR>times make the Courts powerless to help when help is
most needed ; and<BR>which will cause more hardship than it
alleviates.</FONT></FONT></P>

the dividing line which has been drawn in criminal cases, nor<BR>is
it that which has been drawn in cases of contract. It is that which
has,<BR>after much doubt, been drawn in cases of tort. For divorce
cases it has<BR>little practical justification.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Every man
is to some extent at the mercy of his temperament. If one<BR>speaks
in terms of culpability, there is not much greater blame on the<BR>man
who is cruel because he was born without the capacity for
self-restraint,<BR>or with a sadistic nature, than on the man who has
lost the capacity for<BR>self-restraint through disease of the mind.
Yet the Courts give relief for<BR>cruel acts when innate lack of
self-control or even lack of self-control due<BR>to disease drives
men inexorably to cruel conduct. So much is clear from<BR>the earlier
cases to which I have referred. And inevitably it must be so if<BR>the
Court is to exercise its duty of protection between spouses who
are<BR>otherwise under a duty to live with one another. It may be
that &quot; to know<BR>&quot; all is to pardon all &quot;; but the
Court cannot act on that maxim. If,<BR>then, a decree on the ground
of cruelty can be granted against the man who<BR>is driven by the
impulse of a diseased brain, because the practical nature<BR>of the
Court's function demands it, why should there be a line, shared<BR>only
by the law of tort, which puts those who do not know their acts
into<BR>a different class from those who cannot avoid their acts? To
say that<BR>the acts in the former class are not really <I>their </I>acts
does not justify such<BR>a distinction, since the same may be said
also of the acts in the latter<BR>class. The distinction is one of
sentiment rather than logic. Since there<BR>is no uniform legal
principle that compels such a distinction I see no reason<BR>why this
House should impose it.</FONT></FONT></P>
