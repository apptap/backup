<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I find nowhere in any of the
cases which were elaborately cited<BR>before us any authority for the
suggested limitation. And by<BR>reference to what principle (and we
are after all dealing with<BR>principles) is such a distinction to be
drawn? When we are told<BR>that a rule is founded upon public policy,
decency and morality it<BR>would seem natural to propose it in all
cases to which it applies<BR>verbally provided that we are still able
to bring ourselves within<BR>the public considerations which were the
expressed basis of the rule.<BR>If, for instance, in an issue where
the child himself is a party&mdash;a<BR>legitimacy proceeding <I>in
rem </I>in the true sense&mdash;it is against public<BR>policy to
admit the evidence of a parent to prove the bastardy of<BR>that
child; why should an entirely different policy permit such<BR>evidence
in the case where a vital issue is still the legitimacy of the<BR>child,
even though it be raised for a different purpose, and perhaps<BR>with
secondary emphasis ? Nor ought we to shut our eyes to the<BR>glaring
absurdity in which a different decision would involve
the<BR>administration of this branch of the law. This evidence, we
are<BR>told, is admissible in divorce; being therefore so received
it<BR>bastardises the child. But if and when the child, as in this
case he<BR>certainly will do, becoming of age, applies for his writ
in this<BR>House; and proceedings follow; the evidence will not be
admissible<BR>and he mil be pronounced legitimate. Equally, of
course, if the<BR>child instituted proceedings to-morrow for a
declaration of legitimacy<BR>we should be afforded the agreeable
prospect of holding judicially<BR>in 1924 that the infant was
illegitimate; and in 1925 that he was<BR>legitimate. Nothing but
absolute necessity, founded upon decisions<BR>binding upon me, would
drive me to a conclusion so ludicrous and<BR>incongruous. I find here
no such necessity. On the contrary, by<BR>adhering to an ancient rule
of the highest authority, in its natural<BR>and ordinary meaning;
adding nothing to it; but giving full effect<BR>to the terms in which
it has been expressed; 1 am able to avoid an<BR>inconsistency which
would rightly bring the law into disrepute.</FONT></P>

settlement of the child born by<BR>her, on the ground that the child
was a bastard, in which case the<BR>parish of birth would have been
ordinarily the parish of settlement<BR>of the infant. It was
uniformly held that non-access for this<BR>purpose could not be

evidence could not be received on such a point.<BR>In 1809 the

part of the case. It is beyond<BR>controversy that by the common law
of England neither husband<BR>nor wife could give evidence of
non-access after marriage for the<BR>purpose of showing that a child
of the wife born during the marriage<BR>was illegitimate. Reference

admitted in the case of the <I>Notting-<BR>ham Guardians </I>&quot;

bastardise his issue'&quot; (L.R. 4 C.P.D. at<BR>p. 346). The whole

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The question is one simply of
the construction of the statute.<BR>The competency of persons to give
evidence in a certain case has<BR>no bearing on the question of what
evidence they may give. The<BR>Master of the Rolls said, in his
judgment in this case (App., p. 637,<BR>A-B), that the statute did
not make the husband and wife com-<BR>petent to give any sort of
evidence, whether it was according to<BR>the rules or not: &quot; it
enabled them to give evidence subject to the<BR>restrictions as to
what could be given, just like any other witness.&quot;<BR>This seems
to me an accurate statement of the effect of the statute.<BR>He goes
on to say, however, that he thinks they may in this case<BR>give
evidence of non-access to prove the illegitimacy of the
child,<BR>because the issue in the case is whether adultery was
committed,<BR>and the evidence of non-access is given only to show
that adultery<BR>must have been committed, as it was not begotten by
the husband.<BR>The Master of the Rolls held that the rule is
confined to<BR>cases in which legitimacy is the issue in the suit. I
cannot assent<BR>to this limitation. Every reason for the rule is
just as applicable<BR>to a case in which illegitimacy is proved to
show adultery as it is<BR>to cases in which the inquiry is merely as
to the <I>status </I>of the child.<BR>The limitation suggested is
entirely novel. The rule does not exclude<BR>evidence by husband and
wife of non-access universally; what it<BR>does exclude is such
evidence given to prove the illegitimacy of a<BR>child born during
the marriage. It has never been held that its<BR>applicability is
confined to &quot; legitimacy cases &quot;&mdash;it applies to
every<BR>case in which legitimacy is in dispute.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">It was in an action of ejectment
<I>(Goodright on the demise of Stevens<BR></I>v. <I>Moss) </I>that
Lord Mansfield laid down this rule.   He said that decla-<BR>rations
by the parents that the child had been born before marriage<BR>had
been improperly rejected, and, when he stated the true rule as<BR>being
that the declarations of a father or a mother cannot be admitted<BR>to
bastardise the issue born after marriage, it is obvious that he<BR>was
speaking of it with reference to the class of action which was<BR>before
the Court.    The Settlement cases in which the rule was so<BR>often
applied were not legitimacy cases in the sense in which the<BR>M.R.
uses the term, they were merely cases in which the parish<BR>of
settlement depended on legitimacy or illegitimacy, just as the<BR>title
to land in ejectment may so depend.    Such evidence has been<BR>always
excluded not merely when the <I>status </I>of legitimacy is to 
be<BR>determined in proceedings for the purpose, but whenever the
question<BR>of legitimacy arises in order to ascertain the right to
land, to a<BR>parochial settlement, to a title, or to anything else. 
  The rule applies<BR>to all evidence by husband and wife of
non-access in order to show<BR>that a child born of the wife after
marriage is illegitimate.    As the<BR>M.R. said, the evidence which
the husband and wife may give is subject<BR>to all legal
restrictions, and one of these is that they cannot be called<BR>to
disprove intercourse so as to bastardise the child.</FONT></P>

erroneous and that the rule<BR>excluding such evidence is not
confined to &quot; legitimacy cases,&quot; as<BR>the M.R. thought,
whatever that expression may denote, and<BR>that its application
extends to all evidence of non-access. The<BR>practice must be based
on a certain construction of the Act of<BR>1869. If it appears that
the Act does not bear that construction the<BR>foundation for the
practice is gone and the whole superstructure<BR>collapses. The fact
that such a view is favoured by the practice<BR>of the Divorce Court
cannot affect the meaning of the Statute.<BR>The admission of such
evidence must in many cases shorten cases<BR>and save expense. There
is great pressure of business in the Divorce<BR>Court, a great many
of the cases are undefended, and, in the cases in<BR>which a defence
has been entered, very commonly both parties are<BR>equally anxious
to get a divorce. The point has never really been<BR>seriously
considered and adjudicated upon.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">happens when married persons are
in bed together does offend<BR>against decency, which, in. the time
of Lord Mansfield, would have<BR>been generally considered as
synonymous with morality. And here<BR>I must most respectfully
protest against the sense attributed by the<BR>learned Judges of the
Court of Appeal in this case to the term<BR>&quot; decency.&quot; The
late Master of the Rolls, whose judgments I have<BR>always considered
with the greatest respect, did, I cannot help<BR>saying, to my
thinking, entirely misinterpret the word &quot; decency &quot;<BR>as
used by Lord Mansfield. Again and again he insists on the fact<BR>that
in many other cases Judges are faced to consider details of the<BR>most
unsavoury character, and that there can be no reason to<BR>suppose
that, if they are subjected to that unpleasantness, they<BR>would
shrink from what they might have to meet in respect of the<BR>evidence
in question. My Lords, decency, as Lord Mansfield used<BR>the term, I
venture to think had nothing in the world to do with the<BR>feelings
of Judges. Judges are bound to do their duty. How far<BR>they may
become case-hardened to all they are called on to hear will<BR>depend
on individual attributes. But, whether it pains them or not,<BR>I am
sure they will do their duty. The decency that Lord
Mansfield<BR>referred to was the decency before all the world of
laying bare the<BR>most secret, and, at the same time, the most
sacred, of the legitimate<BR>relations of man and woman as husband
and wife. I do not think<BR>I need emphasise the natural repugnance
which such a proposal<BR>excites. Let me rather point out for a
moment the consequences<BR>of allowing such evidence. I agree that in
so doing, though not<BR>leaving the question of decency, I
necessarily also enter the domain<BR>of public policy. Let me first
remind your Lordships that the sole<BR>question is as to proving
adultery by reason of the two concomitant<BR>facts, the birth of a
child and non-access by the husband. It is<BR>common knowledge that
the use of various means to effectuate<BR>birth-control is not
unknown, and is practised by some, be they<BR>many or few. Are we to
have a husband going into the box to say:<BR>&quot; This child was
not mine, because I took the precautions which are<BR>&quot;
effectual,&quot; and then to have the jury consider the question as
to<BR>whether this statement satisfies them ? Or again, is there to
be the<BR>necessity that the jury are to be satisfied as to the
reliability of the<BR>man's memory as to whether he, on a stated
occasion, did not exercise<BR>marital functions ? And here I must say
I am not moved by the<BR>observation made by the learned Judges of
the Court of Appeal when<BR>it was pointed out that this opened the
door to a married man to<BR>asseverate adultery on the part of his
wife when she had had a child,<BR>that juries might be trusted.</FONT></P>

husband, tired of his wife and anxious<BR>for a new start (for be it

against the interests of decency and public policy<BR>that the
spouses should be allowed to give evidence of non-access,<BR>and thus

was it altered by the passing of<BR>the Act which made the spouses
competent witnesses in proceedings<BR>arising out of adultery ? My
Lords, I cannot conceive how this<BR>can be. The competency of a
witness, as a witness, is a perfectly<BR>different thing from what
can be accepted as testimony. In Lord<BR>Mansfield's time there was
no question as to the competency of the<BR>spouses as witnesses; he
specially draws the distinction. He says<BR>they are not only
competent, but the best witnesses as to the date<BR>of birth. In all
the Poor Law cases, after the disability interest<BR>was abolished,
the spouses were competent witnesses. I confess,<BR>therefore, that
if once the rule is established, I see nothing in the<BR>admission of
the spouses to be competent witnesses to alter the rule.<BR>I have

conjugal conduct is used,<BR>not as a thing in itself, but as leading
to other inferences that<BR>the harm comes in. No proof of conduct or

communicating venereal<BR>disease, no proof of connection such as in
itself is condonation,<BR>has the remotest reference to the point of

It is indeed a misfortune for him, if<BR>my view is right, that the

lay<BR>down a universal proposition :&mdash;&quot; Neither husband
nor wife can be<BR>&quot; examined for the purpose of proving
non-access during marriage &quot;<BR>&mdash;which went beyond the
decision. Not only, however, was this<BR>a pauper settlement case,
one of a class in which the rule un-<BR>doubtedly applies, but Lord
Denman, giving the first judgment,<BR>expressly quoted it from &quot;
Starkie on Evidence,&quot; Ed. 2. Now<BR>Starkie, in his original
work (1824), as well as in the edition quoted<BR>of 1833, followed
the plan of the older Abridgments and<BR>Digests, and arranged this
part of his book under headings<BR>such as Bastardy and Pedigree.
Lord Denman, citing and ap-<BR>proving this work, of course knew, as
did his colleagues, that the<BR>statement quoted occurred under the
latter heading and was not<BR>of general application, but, as the
case in hand was a case of derivative<BR>pauper settlement, he had no
need to draw the distinction. Without<BR>bearing these facts in mind,
the judgments in <I>R. </I>v. <I>Sourton </I>are apt<BR>to be cited
as laying down a wider proposition than was intended <I>(see<BR></I>for
example per Lopes, J., in <I>Nottingham Guardians </I>v.

are liable.<BR>The common feature of all these cases is, of course,
that the<BR>legitimacy of a person, whose status, rights and

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">For fifty years it seems to have
been the view of the Judges<BR>who have sat and of the members of the
legal profession who have<BR>practised in divorce cases that by its
nature the rule in <I>Goodright's </I>case<BR>is not a rule of
Divorce law.  The point is not that the books contain<BR>little, if
anything, to the contrary of the application of the rule,<BR>but that
there is nothing to show that it has been held to apply<BR>at all.   
The question cannot have been entirely absent in litigation<BR>until
the last three or four years, and we know that in that period<BR>many
decrees have been granted after and in consequence of the<BR>admission
of a husband's evidence, which, if applicable, this rule<BR>would
have excluded.   It is no answer to say that a husband's evi-<BR>dence
of non-access has only been admitted to save expense and time.<BR>That
is not the way in which matrimonial jurisdiction is or ought to<BR>be
exercised.  Decrees of dissolution of marriage are to be made
only<BR>upon strict proof.   Consent to a decree, direct or indirect,
is inad-<BR>missible, nor is there any one present to make
admissions, if the suit<BR>is undefended.  In such cases the Judge
must, and I doubt not does,<BR>watch vigilantly to see that the
evidence on which he acts is such<BR>only as he is entitled to
receive, and the rule in <I>Goodright's </I>case, if<BR>it applies at
all, is a striking one which could hardly be overlooked.<BR>The fact
that both parties are equally anxious to get a divorce is<BR>precisely
a reason why the Judge should be absolutely strict as to<BR>proof.   
No  consideration  of  saving time  and  trouble  can  be 
a<BR>legitimate ground for admitting illegitimate evidence.     Once
only<BR>does the matter appear to have been referred to.    Horridge,
J.,<BR>whose wide experience in such cases is well known, raised a
doubt in a<BR>defended case <I>(Bowden </I>v. <I>Bowden, </I>62 Sol.
Journ. 105) but nevertheless<BR>admitted the evidence.    Neither the
grounds for the doubt nor the<BR>grounds for the decision are
reported.    In <I>Gaskill v. Gaskill </I>(1921,<BR>P. 425), where
the admission of the husband's evidence tending to<BR>prove
non-access was not questioned at the hearing, I cannot but think<BR>that
the Attorney-General would have challenged it on the further<BR>inquiry,
if it had been of even doubtful admissibility, for the objec-<BR>tion,
if well founded, was fatal to the whole suit and its issue need<BR>not
then have been perilled on a nice and difficult matter of
medical<BR>evidence.   This is all the more noticeable because the
rule about the<BR>weight of the evidence required to rebut the
presumption of coition<BR>(a matter removed from consideration in
this case by the verdict),<BR>which was dealt with in <I>Morris </I>v.
<I>Davies, </I>was discussed and con-<BR>sidered by Lord Birkenhead
and his quotation of Lord Lyndhurst's<BR>opinion is followed by the
words:  &quot; I need only mention that Lord<BR>&quot; Lyndhurst
referred to a sentence of divorce pronounced in accord-<BR>&quot;
ance with the law as it then existed, and the rule he stated must<BR>&quot;
be modified to accord with the present state of the law, but no<BR>&quot;
point arises here upon that aspect of his judgment.    It is true<BR>&quot;
that the observations were made in reference to a legitimacy suit,<BR>&quot;
but I cannot conceive that in the present case any
different<BR>principle can apply otherwise it might happen that the
mother<BR>&quot; would be condemned for adultery on evidence which
would not<BR>disentitle the child to be declared to be the legitimate
issue of her<BR>&quot; husband.&quot;    An argument which gave rise
to such observations,<BR>could  hardly  have stopped  short without 
drawing  attention  to<BR><I>Goodright's </I>case and <I>R. </I>v.
<I>Sourton, </I>except upon the  assumption<BR>that, in the opinion

the reasons which Lord<BR>Mansfield gave for his version of the rule
differed from those which<BR>are to be found in the decided cases on

himself. Further, it was many, years<BR>before his version was fully

v. Rook, </I>1 Wilson 340, the<BR>reason for closing the mother's

relieve her husband from supporting<BR>the child, and so was
interested evidence; though, apparently, if no<BR>other evidence of
it could be got, her evidence might be admitted on the<BR>ground of
necessity <I>(R. </I>v. <I>Bedall, 2 </I>Str. 941, 1076). Francis

Bathurst, J.,<BR>in 1772, only five years before <I>Goodright </I>v.
<I>Moss. </I>Not only does<BR>he seem to be a stranger to the rule in

of the child's interest in not<BR>being bastardised superseded
finally the consideration of the<BR>husband's interest in not having
to keep the child as the ground on<BR>which the rule was thought to
be justified. Down to 1856 <I>(Legge </I>v.<BR><I>Edmunds, </I>25

person as Wood, V.C., that Lord Mansfield's statement of<BR>the law
in <I>Goodright </I>v. <I>Moss </I>was new, and I venture to think,
con-<BR>sidering what grounds there are for taking this view, that
one ought<BR>not to attach very great weight to so general a

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">It is convenient to consider
further how far the rule would go<BR>if applied in ordinary divorce
cases, not, of course, for the purpose of<BR>deciding questions
before they arise but of testing the grounds for<BR>applying the rule
at all. The fact to be proved, on which the husband's<BR>right to a
divorce is based, is simply the wife's adultery. Whether<BR>her
adultery resulted in the birth of a child or not is immaterial
to<BR>that right. The birth of the child is not one of the <I>facta
probanda </I>but<BR>it may be one of the <I>facta probativa. </I>For
this purpose the birth<BR>of a still-born child or a miscarriage or
mere pregnancy would,<BR>if sufficiently referable to the critical
time, be equally probative.<BR>On the other hand, if the child died
before the hearing or were a<BR>hopeless imbecile from birth, how
could bastardising it cause any pre-<BR>judice ? In this connection,
therefore, the existence of a living child is<BR>but an incident, if
not a mere accident. In the catena of proof of the<BR>adultery
alleged his birth and existence may range almost anywhere<BR>from
being practically conclusive to being of no importance<BR>until dates
can be fixed, which the rest of the evidence leaves in<BR>doubt. If,
both spouses being white themselves and of indubitably<BR>white
ancestry on both sides, the wife bears a mulatto child of<BR>marked
negro paternity, I do not see what need there is of further<BR>testimony
about access, and I suppose (at least I hope) that common<BR>sense
would prevail over presumption. At the other end of the scale,<BR>until
the petitioner can fix his own absence or abstinence between<BR>dates

there is no doubt that Lord Poulett's evidence was given in<BR>advance

bastardising in the fullest sense of the term a claimant who

because it<BR>did not bastardise the offspring, for it did, but
because it did not<BR>tend to prove that there had not been
connection between the<BR>spouses during the marriage; because on the
contrary it proved<BR>Lord Poulett's virtue as a bachelor without
touching the per-<BR>formance of his marital duties as a married man.

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">My Lords, I cannot find any
guidance in the application of the rule<BR>either in Lord Mansfield's
words, decency, morality and public policy.<BR>The last tells us
nothing. All our law, even statute law, is supposed to<BR>rest on
public policy, but as public policy is an evolving not to say<BR>an
unstable thing, the public policy of one century may not be quite<BR>the
same as that of the next but one. In a matter like the present
the<BR>word morality tells us nothing. In this case what moralists
condemn<BR>the law ignores. What the Petitioner described was outside
the law<BR>but it was matter of fact. The questions were would the
law admit<BR>evidence of that fact and would men of the world believe
it ? Upon<BR>these three subjects morality, decency and public
policy, I will<BR>only say this. If it had been feasible for the
Petitioner to have given<BR>evidence of &quot;non-access&quot; by the
mouth of some third person,<BR>some chambermaid or spy, or, it may
be, by the wife's written<BR>confession, that the child was not his
and that nothing had taken<BR>place between the spouses that could
have made it his, he could<BR>have taken his proceedings and called
this evidence, and if he failed<BR>to obtain his decree it would not
have been decency or morality or<BR>the bastardising of the child
that would have defeated him but the<BR>incredulity of the jury. If
on the other hand the evidence, which his<BR>case required, was
merely something &quot; tending to prove non-access,&quot;<BR>as for
example absence from home, then a well-to-do man, able to<BR>afford
the search for and the production of the evidence of third<BR>persons
to prove it, would get his decree, but a labourer who had<BR>wandered
in search of work and could only prove his absence from<BR>home by
his own evidence would find his mouth closed on a vital<BR>point and
would remain tied to an unfaithful wife and bound to<BR>maintain
another's child in the name of a rule founded on public<BR>policy.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">That the exclusion must extend
to any evidence tending to<BR>prove &quot; non-access &quot; if there
is to be exclusion at all, I quite agree.<BR>There are many dicta to
this effect, and I think your Lordships<BR>have felt throughout the
weight of this contention. The indecency<BR>is in the denial of those
normal connubial relations which are pre-<BR>sumed in law, not in the
relations which may have been substituted<BR>for them, nor in the
details of various forms of amorous, but<BR>non-generative,
behaviour. It cannot be a question of the same<BR>bed, the same room,
the same house, or the same parish. Non-<BR>access, as it is called,
is the matter either to be proved or to be<BR>excluded, and the
exclusion of the spouses' evidence must extend to<BR>all items of
proof without regard to their relative magnitude, since<BR>each one
may be essential to the conclusion. One has only to<BR>imagine how
possible it might be with time, money, and skilled<BR>advice to build
up a sufficient case of non-access without calling<BR>the husband,
who procures, pays for and profits by the result, and<BR>how
impossible such a course would be to a man who has no time,<BR>no
money and no advisers, but merely knows the truth himself<BR>better
than anyone else can know it, to see the inequality of the<BR>working
of this rule of exclusion in divorce cases.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">As for decency, I agree that
Lord Mansfield did not exclusively<BR>refer to what is in itself
unseemly or disgusting. He probably<BR>thought more of things which a
husband should be ashamed to<BR>say,  than of things that a judge
must blush to hear, but  what<BR>does that prove? Decency would not
surely prevent a husband<BR>from saying that during such and such a
year he was continuously<BR>in India, and yet decent or not that is
excluded when the rule applies<BR>at all, since it tends to prove
&quot;non-access.&quot; I find no guidance to<BR>be derived from this
word, and will only say how grave an injustice<BR>is done, in my
opinion, to the memory of the late Lord Sterndale<BR>in thinking that
he went strangely wrong in applying Lord Mansfield's<BR>word
&quot;decency&quot; to the feelings, which bars things
contaminating<BR>and gross (an error, if it be one, which I share) or
in dwelling on<BR>the revolting aspect which such evidence might
take, so as to<BR>make the task of Judges in divorce cases lighter,
and to enable<BR>them to shirk duties which they ought to perform. Of
such<BR>a course he was incapable nor would it occur to Judges of
the<BR>High Court in England so to interpret his reasoning. I
have<BR>had the great honour of being counted among their number,
and<BR>I am convinced that all the heavy responsibilities, which
these<BR>cases involve, are accepted without demur, and further that
they<BR>watch the admissibility of the evidence tendered in
undefended<BR>divorce cases as vigilantly as if they were protecting

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The argument must next be
examined, which rests on the<BR>phrase about protecting the sanctity
of married intercourse, sub-<BR>stituted by Lord Halsbury for Lord
Mansfield's about bastardising<BR>the issue. Both are relied on as
reasons for extending the rule to<BR>the present case. Are they
merely alternative ways of stating an<BR>identical principle or are
they distinct conditions, both of which<BR>have to be satisfied? If
they are the former, I think that the<BR>whole jurisdiction in
divorce negatives the application of the rule.<BR>Petitions are
presented under that jurisdiction for the express<BR>purpose of
enabling the spouses themselves to publish the facts<BR>of their
married life and so to obtain a decree dissolving the marriage,<BR>the
sanctity of which the rule stated in the <I>Poulett </I>case was
devised<BR>to preserve. If, on the other hand, the preservation of
the sanctity<BR>of married life and the protection of the legitimacy
of the issue born<BR>in wedlock are separate and distinct conditions
of the applicability<BR>of the rule, the question arises whether in

causes and impossible loyalties in 1857.<BR>It is not a matter only
of the physical relations between spouses.<BR>These are equally fit
or unfit to be divulged whether there is<BR>a child or not. You
cannot give the spouses the legal right<BR>to have their married life
investigated in open court, with a<BR>view to its formal and legal
termination, without being prepared<BR>when necessary to violate the
sanctity of that life. The law<BR>recognises this. The Divorce Court
sits that the secrets of<BR>married life may be divulged. Its decorum
is preserved <I>by </I>those<BR>who preside and those who practise in
it, and is preserved with<BR>extraordinary success; but to exclude a
particular class of evidence<BR>when it is given by one person and
not when it is given by another,<BR>is a thing that can only
prejudice that decorum by making it plain<BR>that the Court is being
kept in the dark on a material part of the<BR>case, while making the
sanctity of matrimonial intercourse the<BR>subject of prurient
curiosity and malicious gibes as before. Decently<BR>or not, the law

say that the rule only applies where the child's<BR>rights are

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">It is, however, said that, if
the distinction is drawn between<BR>the technical issues in a divorce
case and the technical issues in<BR>a subsequent legitimacy case,
absurd and unpopular results will<BR>follow. In the one case, a jury
may find that the respondent bore<BR>a bastard child whereon the
Judge dissolved her marriage, while in<BR>the other it may be held
that the child is no bastard but his putative<BR>father's son; for
the father's mouth is undoubtedly closed by<BR>the law in legitimacy
proceedings. I do not see why we should be<BR>dismayed at this. If
the petitioner could have made out his case<BR>by the evidence of
third persons tending to prove and sufficiently<BR>proving his
non-access, precisely the same results would happen,<BR>and this
contradiction could not be helped. When two persons<BR>are indicted
for a criminal act committed on one another and<BR>are not tried at
the same time, one may be acquitted and the other<BR>convicted; yet
no one proposes that the act should for that reason<BR>no longer be
regarded as an offence at all. The accident of<BR>different results
arrived at on the two trials is recognised as an<BR>accident. No
difficulty will arise in the present case, if people<BR>will only
realise that the trial of a petition for divorce between<BR>spouses
is not in fact or law the trial of an issue as to the<BR>legitimacy
of another person or <I>vice versa, </I>and that what is<BR>evidence
on the one occasion is not evidence on the other, but<BR>that the
child can only be affected legally in proceedings to which<BR>he is a
party and by evidence that is admissible against him,<BR>and is not

melodrama than for the disillusioned minds of those<BR>who know the
Divorce Court, but the risk, great or small, must be<BR>run. Every
enlargement of the classes of competent witnesses and<BR>of
admissible questions is accompanied by a certain amount of<BR>perjury.

	submitted to the jury. Indeed, no one could<BR>read the summing up

<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">My Lords, I do not think it is
necessary to decide whether the<BR>rule as laid down by Lord
Mansfield was altered by the Act of 1869<BR>to which I have already
referred, as in my opinion the only autho-<BR>rities cited show that
it was only applied in cases where the direct<BR>issue was the
question of the legitimacy of a child. It is a<BR>remarkable fact
that so far as the reports show no attempt<BR>to apply the rule has
ever been made in the 55 years that<BR>have elapsed since the passing
of this Act in the trial of such<BR>issues as adultery, condonation,
custody of children, &amp;c. If<BR>you take the rule as founded on
decency and morality the very<BR>nature of the issues to be tried
from day to day in the Divorce Court<BR>shows how constantly such
decency and morality has to be<BR>outraged, and the books are full of
cases when, to use the words of<BR>Lord Dunedin, the most secret and
at the same time the most sacred<BR>of the most legitimate relations
of man and woman as husband and<BR>wife are laid bare before all the
world. I do not merely refer to<BR>cases of nullity, when the very
nature of the case requires the most<BR>painful disclosures by
husband or wife, but also to cases as to<BR>whether intercourse put
an end to a deed of separation <I>(Rowell </I>v.<BR><I>Rowell, </I>1900,1
Q.B. 9), whether intercourse was refused <I>(Rippingale

other Judges of the Divorce Court which all go to show<BR>&quot; that

trial the father was cross-examined with a view to<BR>showing the

husband<BR>and it was sought to rescind such order on the grounds of
the wife's<BR>adultery the justices refused to receive direct
evidence of the husband<BR>or the admission of the wife as to the
paternity of the child. Sir J.<BR>Hannen (afterwards Lord Hannen),
the President of the Court,<BR>reversed the decision of the justices
and stated as follows : ' Unfor-<BR>&quot; tunately in refusing to
act on evidence of the parties they (the<BR>&quot; magistrates) seem
to have been under the impression that the<BR>&quot; issue was one of
bastardy which it was not, but one of adultery &quot;<BR>and he there

taken in the present case.</FONT></P>

that I understand how far it is contended<BR>the rule in question

illegitimacy of the child or involving any legal<BR>consequences to
the child. For instance, in the present case it<BR>is said the
evidence of the father as to non-access is inadmissible<BR>because it
would bastardise the child&mdash;would the evidence be<BR>inadmissible
if no child had been born but the mother had a mis-<BR>carriage which
would equally prove the adultery ? If a woman<BR>confessed &quot; I
committed adultery with A. B. when my husband<BR>&quot; was abroad,&quot;
would the admissibility of this confession depend<BR>upon whether a
child was born or not, and would the husband be<BR>able to give such
evidence on an issue of adultery in the one event<BR>and not in the
other ?</FONT></P>

Supposing a woman avers that her<BR>husband resumed cohabitation
after knowledge of her adultery<BR>and thereby condoned it, will he
be allowed to give evidence that<BR>no such cohabitation took place
if no child has been born, and will<BR>he be precluded from giving
such evidence if in the meantime a<BR>child has been born ?&mdash;the
knowledge of the conception of which<BR>may have been the very reason

the admission of this<BR>&quot; evidence in the present case reduce
the law of England ! The<BR>&quot; infant may be illegitimate for the
purpose of proving adultery;<BR> &quot; but legitimate for the
purpose of succeeding to property or title&quot;<BR>I should like,
however, to point out that exactly the same result<BR>would follow if
non-access was proved by a witness other than the<BR>father, which
would admittedly be legal proof and that, further,<BR>under such
circumstances it would be open to a Court before whom<BR>the direct
question of the child's legitimacy was tried to disregard<BR>the
verdict of adultery and to come to the conclusion that the<BR>child
was legitimate! But, my Lords, to what an extraordinary<BR>state
would the rejection of this evidence in the present case reduce<BR>the
law of England ? Here is a husband who knows, and who has<BR>proved
to the satisfaction of a jury that he has not had access to
or<BR>connection with his wife, and that his wife therefore must be
guilty<BR>of adultery, and he is to be informed that the law of
England gives<BR>him no relief, and binds him to his adulterous wife
because he is<BR>.not allowed to give evidence which he alone is
capable of giving!</FONT></P>

jury, which cannot be challenged if the<BR>evidence was admissible,
should stand, and that this Appeal should<BR>be dismissed. The
question of whether, apart from the evidence<BR>of the husband, there
