      <P>My Lords,</P>
      <OL>
        <LI value=1><A name=para1>Can a person change the sex with which he or 
        she is born? Stated in an over-simplified and question-begging form, 
        this is the issue raised by this appeal. More specifically, the question 
        is whether the petitioner, Mrs Elizabeth Bellinger, is validly married 
        to Mr Michael Bellinger. On 2 May 1981 Mr and Mrs Bellinger went through 
        a ceremony of marriage to each other. Section 1(c) of the Nullity of 
        Marriage Act 1971, re-enacted in section 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes 
        Act 1973, provides that a marriage is void unless the parties are 
        'respectively male and female'. The question is whether, at the time of 
        the marriage, Mrs Bellinger was 'female' within the meaning of that 
        expression in the statute. In these proceedings she seeks a declaration 
        that the marriage was valid at its inception and is subsisting. The 
        trial judge, Johnson J, refused to make this declaration: see [2001] 1 
        FLR 389. So did the Court of Appeal, by a majority of two to one: see <A 
        href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1140.html"><A 
        href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1140.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1140.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 1140</a></A></A>, <A

        and Robert Walker LJ. Thorpe LJ dissented. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=2><A name=para2>In an alternative claim, advanced for the 
        first time before your Lordships' House, Mrs Bellinger seeks a 
        declaration that section 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 is 
        incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the European Convention on Human 
        Rights. The Lord Chancellor has intervened in the proceedings as the 
        minister with policy responsibility for that statutory provision. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=3><A name=para3>Mrs Bellinger was born on 7 September 1946. At 
        birth she was correctly classified and registered as male. That is 
        common ground. For as long as she can remember, she felt more inclined 
        to be female. She had an increasing urge to live as a woman rather than 
        as a man. Despite her inclinations, and under some pressure, in 1967 she 
        married a woman. She was then twenty one. The marriage broke down. They 
        separated in 1971 and were divorced in 1975. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=4><A name=para4>Since then Mrs Bellinger has dressed and lived 
        as a woman. She underwent treatment, described below. When she married 
        Mr Bellinger he was fully aware of her background. He has throughout 
        been entirely supportive of her. She was described on her marriage 
        certificate as a spinster. Apart from that, the registrar did not ask 
        about her gender status, nor did Mrs Bellinger volunteer any 
        information. Since their marriage Mr and Mrs Bellinger have lived 
        happily together as husband and wife, and have presented themselves in 
        this way to the outside world. </A>
        <P></P><I>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indicia of sex and transsexual 
        people</P></I>
        <LI value=5><A name=para5>The indicia of human sex or gender (for 
        present purposes the two terms are interchangeable) can be listed, in no 
        particular order, as follows. (1) Chromosomes: XY pattern in males, XX 
        in females. (2) Gonads: testes in males, ovaries in females. (3) 
        Internal sex organs other than the gonads: for instance, sperm ducts in 
        males, uterus in females. (4) External genitalia. (5) Hormonal patterns 
        and secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial hair and body 
        shape: no one suggests these criteria should be a primary factor in 
        assigning sex. (6) Style of upbringing and living. (7) Self-perception. 
        Some medical research has suggested that this factor is not exclusively 
        psychological. Rather, it is associated with biological differentiation 
        within the brain. The research has been very limited, and in the present 
        state of neuroscience the existence of such an association remains 
        speculative. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=6><A name=para6>In the vast majority of cases these indicia in 
        an individual all point in the same direction. There is no difficulty in 
        assigning male or female gender to the individual. But nature does not 
        draw straight lines. Some people have the misfortune to be born with 
        physiological characteristics which deviate from the normal in one or 
        more respects, and to lesser or greater extent. These people attract the 
        convenient shorthand description of inter-sexual. In such cases 
        classification of the individual as male or female is best done by 
        having regard to all the factors I have listed. If every person has to 
        be classified as either male or female, that is the best that can be 
        done. That was the course, in line with medical opinion, followed by 
        Charles J in <I>W v W (Physical Inter-sex)</I> [2001] Fam 111, 146d-f. 
        That is not the problem arising in the present case. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=7><A name=para7>Transsexual people are to be distinguished 
        from inter-sexual people. Transsexual is the label given, not altogether 
        happily, to a person who has the misfortune to be born with physical 
        characteristics which are congruent but whose self-belief is 
        incongruent. Transsexual people are born with the anatomy of a person of 
        one sex but with an unshakeable belief or feeling that they are persons 
        of the opposite sex. They experience themselves as being of the opposite 
        sex. Mrs Bellinger is such a person. The aetiology of this condition 
        remains uncertain. It is now generally recognised as a psychiatric 
        disorder, often known as gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder. 
        It can result in acute psychological distress. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=8><A name=para8>The treatment of this condition depends upon 
        its severity and the circumstances of the individual. In severe cases 
        conventional psychiatric treatment is inadequate. Ultimately the most 
        that medical science can do in order to alleviate the condition is, in 
        appropriate cases, to rid the body of its intensely disliked features 
        and make it accord, so far as possible, with the anatomy craved. This is 
        done by means of hormonal and other treatment and major surgery, 
        popularly known as a 'sex change' operation. In this regard medical 
        science and surgical expertise have advanced much in recent years. 
        Hormonal treatment can change a person's secondary sexual 
        characteristics. Irreversible surgery can adapt or remove genitalia and 
        other organs, external and internal. By this means a normal body of one 
        sex can be altered so as to give the appearance of a normal body of the 
        other sex. But there are still limits to what can be done. Gonads cannot 
        be constructed. The creation of replica genital organs is particularly 
        difficult with female to male gender reassignment surgery. Chromosomal 
        patterns remain unchanged. The change of body can never be complete. 
</A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=9><A name=para9>Surgery of this nature is the last step in 
        what are typically four steps of treatment. The four steps are 
        psychiatric assessment, hormonal treatment, a period of living as a 
        member of the opposite sex subject to professional supervision and 
        therapy (the 'real life experience'), and finally, in suitable cases, 
        gender reassignment surgery. In February 1981 Mrs Bellinger, having been 
        through the previous stages of treatment, successfully underwent this 
        form of surgery. This involved removal of her testes and penis and, in 
        the words of Johnson J, 'the creation of an orifice which can be 
        described as an artificial vagina, but she was still without uterus or 
        ovaries or any other biological characteristics of a woman.' A 
        chromosomal test, dated 8 April 1999, showed her to have a karyotype 
        46XY pattern, an apparently normal male karyotype. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=10><A name=para10>For completeness I should mention in passing 
        that a transsexual person is to be distinguished from a homosexual 
        person. A homosexual is a person who is attracted sexually to persons of 
        the same sex. Nor should a transsexual person be confused with a 
        transvestite. A transvestite is a person who, usually for the purpose of 
        his or her sexual gratification, enjoys dressing in the clothes of the 
        opposite sex. </A>
        <P></P><I>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present state of the law</P></I>
        <LI value=11><A name=para11>The present state of English law regarding 
        the sex of transsexual people is represented by the well known decision 
        of Ormrod J in <I>Corbett v Corbett</I> [1971] P 83, 104, 106. That 
        case, like the present one, concerned the gender of a male to female 
        transsexual in the context of the validity of a marriage. Ormrod J held 
        that, in this context, the law should adopt the chromosomal, gonadal and 
        genital tests. If all three are congruent, that should determine a 
        person's sex for the purpose of marriage. Any operative intervention 
        should be ignored. The biological sexual constitution of an individual 
        is fixed at birth, at the latest, and cannot be changed either by the 
        natural development of organs of the opposite sex or by medical or 
        surgical means. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=12><A name=para12>In <I>R v Tan</I> [1983] QB 1053, 1063-1064, 
        the Court of Appeal, comprising May LJ and Parker and Staughton JJ, 
        applied the <I>Corbett</I> approach in the context of criminal law. The 
        court upheld convictions which were dependent on Gloria Greaves, a 
        post-operative male to female transsexual, still being in law a man. In 
        <I>S-T (formerly J) v J </I>[1998] Fam 103, 122, a case of a female to 
        male transsexual, the correctness of the decision in <I>Corbett</I> 
        seems not to have been challenged. But Ward LJ suggested that the 
        decision would bear re-examination. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=13><A name=para13>The decision in <I>Corbett</I> has attracted 
        much criticism, from the medical profession and elsewhere. The criteria 
        for designating a person as male or female are complex. It is too 
        'reductionistic' to have regard only to the three <I>Corbett </I>factors 
        of chromosomes, gonads and genitalia. This approach ignores 'the 
        compelling significance of the psychological status of the person as a 
        man or a woman'. Further, the application of the <I>Corbett</I> approach 
        leads to a substantially different outcome in the cases of a 
        post-operative inter-sexual person and a post-operative transsexual 
        person, even though, post-operatively, the bodies of the two individuals 
        may be remarkably similar. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=14><A name=para14>In overseas jurisdictions <I>Corbett</I> has 
        not been universally followed. It was followed, for instance, in South 
        Africa in <I>W v W</I> (1976) (2) SALR 308 and in Canada in <I>M v M 
        (A)</I> (1984) 42 RFL (2d) 267. But more recently the trend has been in 
        the opposite direction. Thus, for instance, in New Zealand and Australia 
        post-operative transsexuals' assigned sex has been recognised for the 
        purpose of validating their marriages. In New Zealand in 
        <I>Attorney-General v Otahuhu Family Court</I> [1995] 1 NZLR 603, 630, 
        Ellis J noted that once a transsexual person has undergone surgery, he 
        or she is no longer able to operate in his or her original sex. He held 
        there is no social advantage in the law not recognising the validity of 
        the marriage of a transsexual in the sex of reassignment. An adequate 
        test is whether the person in question has undergone surgical and 
        medical procedures that have effectively given the person the physical 
        conformation of a person of a specified sex. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=15><A name=para15>In Australia Chisholm J reached a similar 
        conclusion in <I>Re Kevin (validity of marriage of transsexual)</I> 
        [2001] Fam CA 1074, a case decided after the decision of the Court of 
        Appeal in the present case. Chisholm J's extensive judgment contains a 
        powerful critique of the existing law and a useful review of 
        international developments. Having regard to the view I take of this 
        case, it is not necessary for me to elaborate on his views. Suffice to 
        say, his conclusion was that there is no 'formulaic solution' to 
        determining the sex of an individual for the purpose of the law of 
        marriage. All relevant matters need to be considered, including the 
        person's life experiences and self-perception. Post-operative 
        transsexual people will normally be members of their reassigned sex. 
</A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=16><A name=para16>This decision was the subject of an appeal. 
        Very recently, on 21 February 2003, the full court of the Federal Family 
        Court dismissed the appeal: Appeal no. EA/97/2001 (unreported). The 
        judgment of the full court contains an invaluable survey of the 
        authorities and the issues. The court concluded that in the relevant 
        Commonwealth marriage statute the words 'man' and 'woman' should be 
        given their ordinary, everyday contemporary meaning. Chisholm J. was 
        entitled to conclude, as a question of fact, that the word 'man' 
        includes a post-operative female to male transsexual person. The full 
        court left open the 'more difficult' question of pre-operative 
        transsexual persons. </A>
        <P></P><I>The decisions of the courts below </I>
        <LI value=17><A name=para17>The trial judge, Johnson J, recognised there 
        has been a marked change in social attitudes to problems such as those 
        of Mrs Bellinger since <I>Corbett v Corbett</I> [1971] P 83 was decided 
        in 1970. The law on this matter in this country is, or is becoming, a 
        minority position, at least so far as Europe is concerned. But the law 
        is clear, and as a judge he had to accept the law as it is. What is also 
        clear is that this is no simple matter. Potentially there are serious 
        implications to be considered in relation to the law of marriage and 
        other areas of life: see [2001] 1 FLR 389, 402. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=18><A name=para18>Likewise, the majority of the Court of 
        Appeal, having considered up to date medical evidence, adhered to the 
        <I>Corbett</I> approach. The three criteria relied upon by Ormrod J 
        remain the only basis upon which to decide upon the gender of a child at 
        birth. There is, in informed medical circles, a growing momentum for 
        recognition of transsexual people for every purpose and in a manner 
        similar to those who are inter-sexed. This reflects changes in social 
        attitudes as well as advances in medical research. But recognition of a 
        change of gender for the purposes of marriage would require some 
        certainty regarding the point at which the change takes place. This 
        point is not easily ascertainable. At what point would it be consistent 
        with public policy to recognise that a person should be treated for all 
        purposes, including marriage, as a person of the opposite sex to that 
        which he or she was correctly assigned at birth? This is a question for 
        Parliament, not the courts: see <A

        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Court of Human Rights</I></P>
        <LI value=20><A name=para20>This issue has been before the European 
        Court of Human Rights on several occasions in the last twenty years. 
        During this period the development of human rights law on this issue has 
        been remarkably rapid. Until very recently the court consistently held 
        that application of the <I>Corbett</I> criteria, and consequent 
        non-recognition of change of gender by post-operative transsexual 
        persons, did not constitute a violation of article 8 (right to respect 
        for private life) or article 12 (right to marry): <I>Rees v United 
        Kingdom</I> (1986) 9 EHRR 56, <I>Cossey v United Kingdom</I> (1990) 13 
        EHRR 622, and <I>Sheffield and Horsham v United Kingdom </I>(1998) 27 
        EHRR 163. It is to be noted, however, that in the latter case the court 
        was critical of the United Kingdom's apparent failure to take any steps 
        to keep this area of the law under review. There is, the court said, an 
        increased social acceptance of transsexualism and an increased 
        recognition of the problems which post-operative transsexual people 
        encounter. The court reiterated that this area 'needs to be kept under 
        review by Contracting States': para 60. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=21><A name=para21>In its most recent decision the court has 
        taken the view that the sands of time have run out. The United Kingdom's 
        margin of appreciation no longer extends to declining to give legal 
        recognition to all cases of gender reassignment. This was the decision 
        of the court, sitting as a grand chamber, in the case of <I>Goodwin v 
        United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/588.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 18</a>. Judgment was given in July 2002, 
        that is, after the Court of Appeal gave its judgment in the present 
        case. Christine Goodwin was a post-operative male to female transsexual. 
        The court held unanimously that the United Kingdom was in breach of 
        articles 8 and 12. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=22><A name=para22>The court's judgment was wide-ranging. As it 
        happens, this was not a 'marriage' case. Christine Goodwin had married 
        as a man and later been divorced. Her complaint was that in several 
        respects she, as a post-operative transsexual person, was not treated 
        fairly by the laws or practices of this country. She was unable to 
        pursue a claim for sexual harassment in an employment tribunal because 
        she was considered in law to be a man. She was not eligible for a state 
        pension at 60, the age of entitlement for women. She remained obliged to 
        pay the higher car insurance premiums applicable to men. In many 
        instances she had to choose between revealing her birth certificate and 
        foregoing advantages conditional upon her producing her birth 
        certificate. Her inability to marry as a woman seems not to have been 
        the subject of specific complaint by her. But in its judgment the court 
        expressed its views on this and other aspects of the lack of legal 
        recognition of her gender reassignment. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=23><A name=para23>Some of the main points in the judgment of 
        the court can be summarised as follows. In the interests of legal 
        certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law the court should 
        not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous 
        cases. But the court must have regard to changing conditions within the 
        respondent state and within contracting states generally. The court must 
        respond to any evolving convergence on the standards to be achieved: 
        para 74. A test of congruent biological factors can no longer be 
        decisive in denying legal recognition to the change of gender of a 
        post-operative transsexual: para 100. With increasingly sophisticated 
        types of surgery and hormonal treatments the principal unchanging 
        biological aspect of gender identity is the chromosomal element. It is 
        not apparent that this must inevitably be of decisive significance: para 
        82. The court recognised that it is for a contracting state to 
        determine, amongst other matters, the conditions under which a person 
        claiming legal recognition as a transsexual establishes that gender 
        re-assignment has been properly effected. But it found 'no justification 
        for barring the transsexual from enjoying the right to marry under any 
        circumstances': para 103. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=24><A name=para24>This decision of the court was essentially 
        prospective in character. The court made this plain. Until 1998, the 
        date of the decision in<I> Sheffield and Horsham v United Kingdom 
        </I>(1998) 27 EHRR 163, the court had found that the United Kingdom's 
        treatment of post-operative transsexual people was within this country's 
        margin of appreciation and that this treatment did not violate the 
        Convention. By the <I>Goodwin</I> decision the court found that 'the 
        situation, as it has evolved, <I>no longer</I> falls within the United 
        Kingdom's margin of appreciation': paras 119-120 (emphasis added). </A>
        <P></P><I>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developments since the Goodwin decision 
        </P></I>
        <LI value=25><A name=para25>This decision of the European Court of Human 
        Rights prompted three developments. First, in written answers to the 
        House of Commons on 23 July 2002, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
        Lord Chancellor's Department noted that the interdepartmental working 
        group on transsexual people had been reconvened. Its terms of reference 
        include re-examining the implications of granting full legal status to 
        transsexual people in their acquired gender. The minister stated that 
        the working group had been asked to consider urgently the implications 
        of the <I>Goodwin</I> judgment. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=26><A name=para26>The second development has an important 
        bearing on the outcome of this appeal. On 13 December 2002 the 
        government announced its intention to bring forward primary legislation 
        which will allow transsexual people who can demonstrate they have taken 
        decisive steps towards living fully and permanently in the acquired 
        gender to marry in that gender. The legislation will also deal with 
        other issues arising from the legal recognition of acquired gender. A 
        draft outline Bill will be published in due course. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=27><A name=para27>The third development was that before your 
        Lordships' House counsel for the Lord Chancellor accepted that, from the 
        time of the <I>Goodwin </I>decision, those parts of English law which 
        fail to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transsexual 
        persons are in principle incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the 
        Convention. Domestic law, including section 11(c) of the Matrimonial 
        Causes Act 1973, will have to change. </A>

        <P><I>Gender reassignment </I></P></I>
        <LI value=28><A name=para28>The distinction between male and female 
        exists throughout the animal world. It corresponds to the different 
        roles played in the reproductive process. A male produces sperm which 
        fertilise the female's eggs. In this country, as elsewhere, 
        classification of a person as male or female has long conferred a legal 
        status. It confers a legal status, in that legal as well as practical 
        consequences follow from the recognition of a person as male or female. 
        The legal consequences affect many areas of life, from marriage and 
        family law to gender-specific crime and competitive sport. It is not 
        surprising, therefore, that society through its laws decides what 
        objective biological criteria should be applied when categorising a 
        person as male or female. Individuals cannot choose for themselves 
        whether they wish to be known or treated as male or female. 
        Self-definition is not acceptable. That would make nonsense of the 
        underlying biological basis of the distinction. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=29><A name=para29>This approach did not give rise to legal 
        difficulty before the advent of gender reassignment treatment. This was 
        noted by Lord Reed in his article 'Splitting the difference: 
        transsexuals and European Human Rights law' (September 2000). Gender 
        identity disorder seems always to have existed. But before the advent of 
        gender reassignment treatment a claim by a transsexual person to be 
        recognised in his or her self-perceived gender would have been hopeless. 
        The anatomy of his or her body of itself would have refuted the claim. 
        </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=30><A name=para30>The position has now changed. Recognition of 
        transsexualism as a psychiatric disorder has been accompanied by the 
        development of sophisticated techniques of medical treatment. The 
        anatomical appearance of the body can be substantially altered, by forms 
        of treatment which are permissible as well as possible. It is in these 
        changed circumstances that society is now facing the question of how far 
        it is prepared to go to alleviate the plight of the small minority of 
        people who suffer from this medical condition. Should self-perceived 
        gender be recognised? </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=31><A name=para31>Recognition of gender reassignment will 
        involve some blurring of the normally accepted biological distinction 
        between male and female. Some blurring already exists, unavoidably, in 
        the case of inter-sexual persons. When assessing the gender of 
        inter-sexual persons, matters taken into account include self-perception 
        and style of upbringing and living. Recognition of gender reassignment 
        will involve further blurring. It will mean that in law a person who, 
        unlike an inter-sexual person, had all the biological characteristics of 
        one sex at birth may subsequently be treated as a member of the opposite 
        sex. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=32><A name=para32>Thus the circumstances in which, and the 
        purposes for which, gender reassignment is recognised are matters of 
        much importance. These are not easy questions. The circumstances of 
        transsexual people vary widely. The distinction between male and female 
        is material in widely differing contexts. The criteria appropriate for 
        recognising self-perceived gender in one context, such as marriage, may 
        not be appropriate in another, such as competitive sport. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=33><A name=para33>Stated very shortly, this is the setting for

        <LI value=34><A name=para34>My Lords, I am profoundly conscious of the 
        humanitarian considerations underlying Mrs Bellinger's claim. Much 
        suffering is involved for those afflicted with gender identity disorder. 
        Mrs Bellinger and others similarly placed do not undergo prolonged and 
        painful surgery unless their turmoil is such that they cannot otherwise 
        live with themselves. Non-recognition of their reassigned gender can 
        cause them acute distress. I have this very much in mind. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=35><A name=para35>I also have in mind that increasingly, in 
        the more compassionate times in which we live, there is an international 
        trend towards recognising gender reassignment and not condemning 
        post-operative transsexual people to live in what was aptly described by 
        the European Court of Human Rights in the <I>Goodwin</I> case as an 
        intermediate zone, not quite one gender or the other. And in this 
        country gender reassignment has already received legal recognition for 
        some purposes, for example, for the purpose of the discrimination 
        legislation, in section 2A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. This 
        section was introduced into the statute by the Sexual Discrimination 
        (Gender Re-assignment) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1102). </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=36><A name=para36>Despite this, I am firmly of the view that 
        your Lordships' House, sitting in its judicial capacity, ought not to 
        accede to the submissions made on behalf of Mrs Bellinger. Recognition 
        of Mrs Bellinger as female for the purposes of section 11(c) of the 
        Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 would necessitate giving the expressions 
        'male' and 'female' in that Act a novel, extended meaning: that a person 
        may be born with one sex but later become, or become regarded as, a 
        person of the opposite sex. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=37><A name=para37>This would represent a major change in the 
        law, having far reaching ramifications. It raises issues whose solution 
        calls for extensive enquiry and the widest public consultation and 
        discussion. Questions of social policy and administrative feasibility 
        arise at several points, and their interaction has to be evaluated and 
        balanced. The issues are altogether ill-suited for determination by 
        courts and court procedures. They are pre-eminently a matter for 
        Parliament, the more especially when the government, in unequivocal 
        terms, has already announced its intention to introduce comprehensive 
        primary legislation on this difficult and sensitive subject. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=38><A name=para38>Given this latter circumstance, intervention 
        by the courts would be peculiarly inappropriate when the change being 
        sought in the law raises issues such as the following. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=39><A name=para39>First, much uncertainty surrounds the 
        circumstances in which gender reassignment should be recognised for the 
        purposes of marriage. The present case concerns one individual and her 
        particular condition and circumstances. Although some of the evidence 
        produced is of a general nature, the evidence before the House is 
        focused on the facts of this case. So were the arguments. In particular, 
        Miss Scriven QC submitted that wherever the line marking the transition 
        from one sex to the other is to be drawn, Mrs Bellinger is on the 
        reassigned gender side of the line. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=40><A name=para40>I do not consider this would be a proper or, 
        indeed, a responsible basis on which to change the law. Surgical 
        intervention takes many forms and, for a variety of reasons, is 
        undertaken by different people to different extents. For men it may mean 
        castration or inversion of the penis to create a false vagina. For women 
        it may mean a mastectomy, hysterectomy, or creation of a false penis by 
        phalloplasty. There seems to be no 'standard' operation or recognised 
        definition of the outcome of completed surgery. Today the case before 
        the House concerns Mrs Bellinger. Tomorrow's case in the High Court will 
        relate to a transsexual person who has been able to undergo a less 
        extensive course of surgery. The following week will be the case of a 
        transsexual person who has undergone hormonal treatment but who, for 
        medical reasons, has not been able to undergo any surgery. Then there 
        will be a transsexual person who is medically able to undergo all or 
        part of the surgery but who does not wish to do so. By what criteria are 
        cases such as these to be decided? </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=41><A name=para41>But the problem is more fundamental than 
        this. It is questionable whether the successful completion of some sort 
        of surgical intervention should be an essential prerequisite to the 
        recognition of gender reassignment. If it were, individuals may find 
        themselves coerced into major surgical operations they otherwise would 
        not have. But the aim of the surgery is to make the individual feel more 
        comfortable with his or her body, not to 'turn a man into a woman' or 
        vice versa. As one medical report has expressed it, a male to female 
        transsexual person is no less a woman for not having had surgery, or any 
        more a woman for having had it: see <I>Secretary, Department of Social 
        Security v SRA </I>(1993) 118 ALR 467, 477. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=42><A name=para42>These are deep waters. Plainly, there must 
        be some objective, publicly available criteria by which gender 
        reassignment is to be assessed. If possible the criteria should be 
        capable of being applied readily so as to produce a reasonably clear 
        answer. Parties proposing to enter into a marriage relationship need to 
        know whether their marriage will be valid. Other people need to know 
        whether a marriage was valid. Marriage has legal consequences in many 
        directions: for instance, housing and residential security of tenure, 
        social security benefits, citizenship and immigration, taxation, 
        pensions, inheritance, life insurance policies, criminal law (bigamy). 
        There must be an adequate degree of certainty. Otherwise, as the 
        majority of the Court of Appeal observed, the applicability of the law 
        to an individual suffering from gender identity disorder would be in a 
        state of complete confusion: see <A

        <LI value=43><A name=para43>Your Lordships' House is not in a position 
        to decide where the demarcation line could sensibly or reasonably be

        thirteen member states of the European Union which afford legal 
        recognition to a transsexual person's acquired gender. The 
        pre-conditions for recognition vary considerably. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=44><A name=para44>Further, the House is not in a position to 
        give guidance on what other pre-conditions should be satisfied before 
        legal recognition is given to a transsexual person's acquired gender. 
        Some member states of the European Union insist on the applicant being 
        single or on existing marriages being dissolved. Some insist on the 
        applicant being sterile. Questions arise about the practical mechanisms 
        and procedures for obtaining recognition of acquired gender, and about 
        the problem of people who 'revert' to their original gender after a 
        period in their new gender role. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=45><A name=para45>Secondly, the recognition of gender 
        reassignment for the purposes of marriage is part of a wider problem 
        which should be considered as a whole and not dealt with in a piecemeal 
        fashion. There should be a clear, coherent policy. The decision 
        regarding recognition of gender reassignment for the purpose of marriage 
        cannot sensibly be made in isolation from a decision on the like problem 
        in other areas where a distinction is drawn between people on the basis 
        of gender. These areas include education, child care, occupational 
        qualifications, criminal law (gender-specific offences), prison 
        regulations, sport, the needs of decency, and birth certificates. Birth 
        certificates, indeed, are one of the matters of most concern to 
        transsexual people, because birth certificates are frequently required 
        as proof of identity or age or place of birth. When, and in what 
        circumstances, should these certificates be capable of being reissued in 
        a revised form which does not disclose that the person has undergone 
        gender reassignment? </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=46><A name=para46>Thirdly, even in the context of marriage, 
        the present question raises wider issues. Marriage is an institution, or 
        relationship, deeply embedded in the religious and social culture of 
        this country. It is deeply embedded as a relationship between two 
        persons of the opposite sex. There was a time when the reproductive 
        functions of male and female were regarded as the primary raison d'être 
        of marriage. The Church of England Book of Common Prayer of 1662 
        declared that the first cause for which matrimony was ordained was the 
        'procreation of children'. For centuries this was proclaimed at 
        innumerable marriage services. For a long time now the emphasis has been 
        different. Variously expressed, there is much more emphasis now on the 
        'mutual society, help and comfort that the one ought to have of the 
        other'. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=47><A name=para47>Against this background there are those who 
        urge that the special relationship of marriage should not now be 
        confined to persons of the opposite sex. It should be possible for 
        persons of the same sex to marry. This, it is said, is the appropriate 
        way to resolve problems such as those confronting Mrs Bellinger. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=48><A name=para48>It hardly needs saying that this approach 
        would involve a fundamental change in the traditional concept of 
        marriage. Here again, this raises a question which ought to be 
        considered as part of an overall review of the most appropriate way to 
        deal with the difficulties confronting transsexual people. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=49><A name=para49>For these reasons I would not make a 
        declaration that the marriage celebrated between Mr and Mrs Bellinger in 
        1981 was valid. A change in the law as sought by Mrs Bellinger must be a 
        matter for deliberation and decision by Parliament when the forthcoming 
        Bill is introduced. </A>
        <P></P><I>
        <P><I>Declaration of incompatibility</I></P></I>
        <LI value=50><A name=para50>Mrs Bellinger advanced a further, 
        alternative claim for a declaration that in so far as section 11(c) of 
        the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 makes no provision for the recognition 
        of gender reassignment it is incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the 
        Convention. Her claim is advanced on the footing that, although she and 
        Mr Bellinger celebrated their marriage long before the Human Rights Act 
        1998 came into force, and although the <I>Goodwin</I> decision dealt 
        with the human rights position as at the date of the judgment (July 
        2002), the non-recognition of their ability to marry continues to have 
        adverse practical effects. The statute continues to prevent them 
        marrying each other. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=51><A name=para51>Mr Sales advanced several arguments on why 
        such a declaration should not be made. There is, he submitted, no 
        present incompatibility between the statute and the Convention. The 
        European Court of Human Rights, in its decision in <I>Goodwin</I>, 
        envisaged that the government should have a reasonable period in which 
        to amend domestic law on a principled and coherent basis. The court said 
        it 'will be for the United Kingdom Government <I>in due course</I> to 
        implement such measures as it considers appropriate to fulfil its 
        obligations': see <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/588.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 18</a>, 33, paragraph 120 (emphasis added). 
        </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=52><A name=para52>I cannot accept this submission. It may be 
        that, echoing the language of the European Court of Human Rights in 
        <I>Marckx v Belgium</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/2.html">(1979) 2 EHRR 330</a>, 353, para 58, the principle 
        of legal certainty dispenses the United Kingdom government from 
        re-opening legal acts or situations which antedate the judgment in 
        <I>Goodwin</I>. But that is not the present case. In the present case 
        section 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 remains a continuing 
        obstacle to Mr and Mrs Bellinger marrying each other. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=53><A name=para53>It may also be that there are circumstances 
        where maintaining an offending law in operation for a reasonable period 
        pending enactment of corrective legislation is justifiable. An 
        individual may not then be able, during the transitional period, to 
        complain that his rights have been violated. The admissibility decision 
        of the court in <I>Walden v Liechtenstein</I> (App no 33916/96) is an 
        example of this pragmatic approach to the practicalities of government. 
        But the question now under consideration is different. It is more 
        general. The question is whether non-recognition of gender reassignment 
        for the purposes of marriage is compatible with articles 8 and 12. The 
        answer to this question is clear: it is not compatible. The European 
        Court of Human Rights so found in July 2002 in <I>Goodwin</I>, and the 
        government has so accepted. What was held to be incompatible in July 
        2002 has not now, for the purposes of section 4, become compatible. The 
        government's announcement of forthcoming legislation has not had that 
        effect, nor could it. That would make no sense. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=54><A name=para54>Then Mr Sales submitted that a declaration 
        of incompatibility would serve no useful purpose. A declaration of 
        incompatibility triggers the ministerial powers to amend the offending 
        legislation under the 'fast track' procedures set out in section 10 and 
        Schedule 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998. But the minister's powers have 
        already been triggered in the present case under section 10(1)(b), by 
        reason of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the 
        <I>Goodwin</I> case and the associated case of <I>I v United Kingdom</I> 
        (App no. 25680/94). Further, the government has already announced its 
        intention to bring forward primary legislation on this subject. For this 
        reason also, counsel submitted, making a declaration of incompatibility 
        would serve no useful purpose. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=55><A name=para55>I am not persuaded by these submissions. If 
        a provision of primary legislation is shown to be incompatible with a 
        Convention right the court, in the exercise of its discretion, may make 
        a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 
        1998. In exercising this discretion the court will have regard to all 
        the circumstances. In the present case the government has not sought to 
        question the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in 
        <I>Goodwin</I>. Indeed, it is committed to giving effect to that 
        decision. Nevertheless, when proceedings are already before the House, 
        it is desirable that in a case of such sensitivity this House, as the 
        court of final appeal in this country, should formally record that the 
        present state of statute law is incompatible with the Convention. I 
        would therefore make a declaration of incompatibility as sought. I would 
        otherwise dismiss this appeal. </A>

        <P><B>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</B></P>
        <P>My Lords,</P>
        <LI value=56><A name=para56>My noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of 
        Birkenhead has explained nature of the condition from which Mrs 
        Bellinger has been suffering from as long as she can remember and the 
        profound changes which she has undergone, both physically and socially, 
        to give effect to her wish to live her life as a woman rather than as a 
        man. Her courage and that of Mr Bellinger, who has supported her 
        constantly throughout their marriage, deserve our respect and 
        admiration. If there was a legitimate way of solving their problem and 
        making the declaration which Mrs Bellinger seeks, I would of course wish 
        to take it. But I agree with my noble and learned friend that the 
        expressions "male" and "female" in section 11(c) of the Matrimonial 
        Causes Act 1973 are not capable of being given the extended meaning that 
        would be needed to accommodate her case, and that we have no option but 
        to dismiss this appeal. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=57><A name=para57>The essence of the problem, as I see it, 
        lies in the impossibility of changing completely the sex which 
        individuals acquire when they are born. A great deal can be done to 
        remove the physical features of the sex from which the transsexual 
        wishes to escape and to reproduce those of the sex which he or she 
        wishes to acquire. The body can be altered to produce all the 
        characteristics that the individual needs to feel comfortable, and there 
        are no steps that cannot be taken to adopt a way of life that will 
        enable him or her to enter into a satisfactory and loving heterosexual 
        relationship. But medical science is unable, in its present state, to 
        complete the process. It cannot turn a man into a woman or turn a woman 
        into a man. That is not what the treatment seeks to do after all, 
        although it is described as gender reassignment surgery. It is not just 
        that the chromosomes that are present at birth are incapable of being 
        changed. The surgery, however extensive and elaborate, cannot supply all 
        the equipment that would be needed for the patient to play the part 
        which the sex to which he or she wishes to belong normally plays in 
        having children. At best, what is provided is no more than an imitation 
        of the more obvious parts of that equipment. Although it is often 
        described as a sex change, the process is inevitably incomplete. A 
        complete change of sex is, strictly speaking, unachievable. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=58><A name=para58>It is tempting to regard the fact that a 
        complete sex change is unachievable as a mere technicality when this is 
        compared with everything else that can be achieved in the case of 
        post-operative transsexuals. But the law of marriage exists in order to 
        define the circumstances in which the public status that follows from a 
        valid marriage may be acquired. There is much to be said for the view 
        that the words "male" and "female" should each be given a single, clear 
        meaning that can be applied uniformly in all cases. That was achieved by 
        the decision in <I>Corbett v Corbett</I> [1971] P 83, which pre-dated 
        the re-enactment of section 1(c) of the Nullity of Marriage Act 1971 in 
        section 11(c) of the 1973 Act. Any enlargement of the meaning of those 
        words to accommodate the problems faced by transsexuals would raise 
        questions of fact and degree which are avoided by the use of the words 
        chosen by Parliament. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=59><A name=para59>I do not overlook the fact that Mrs 
        Bellinger's consultant urologist, Michael Royle, declared in a letter 
        dated 5 January 1999 that she underwent gender reassignment surgery on 
        21 February 1981 and that "she is physically female." But it seems to me 
        that this is an incomplete statement of the facts. The wording of 
        section 11(c) demands that they be subjected to a more rigorous 
        assessment. In <I>Secretary, Department of Social Security v SRA</I> 
        (1993) 118 ALR 467 it was held that the respondent, who was a 
        pre-operative male to female transsexual, did not fall within the 
        ordinary meaning of the word "female" as her anatomical sex and her 
        psychological sex had not been harmonised. One of the medical reports 
        referred to by Lockhart J in the Federal Court of Australia, at p 477, 
        explained very clearly what the surgery seeks to achieve, and what it 
        cannot do: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P>
        <UL>"Genetically, and anatomically she is a 'male', however, she 
          dresses and behaves as a woman. She considers herself as a woman. It 
          is not for me to decide what the court or the Department of Social 
          Security chooses to consider someone - but I do not think of, and 
          treat the respondent as a woman. The fact that she has not had surgery 
          to me is irrelevant. The aim of the surgery is to make somebody feel 
          more comfortable with their body, not to 'turn them into a woman'. The 
          surgery does not supply the patient with a uterus, nor with ovaries. 
          It is purely and simply an attempt to allow the person's body to 
          approximate to how they feel within themselves." 
          <P></P></UL>
        <LI value=60><A name=para60>Lockhart J said in the <I>SRA</I> case at p 
        480 that the common understanding of the words "woman" and female" and

        question of fact and that the crucial question was whether different 
        conclusions were reasonably possible as to whether the facts or 
        circumstances fell within their ordinary meaning. In <I>Re Kevin 
        (validity of marriage of transsexual)</I> [2001] FamCA 1074 Chisholm J 
        held that the ordinary contemporary meaning of the word "man" according 
        to its Australian usage included post-operative female to male 
        transsexuals, and that no good reasons had been shown why the ordinary 
        meaning of the word should not apply in the context of marriage law: 
        para 327. He went on to say that there was no formulaic solution for 
        determining the sex of an individual for this purpose, that all relevant 
        factors had to be considered including the person's biological and 
        physical characteristics at birth, the person's life experiences, the 
        extent to which the person has functioned in society as a man or woman, 
        any hormonal, surgical or other medical sex reassignment treatments the 
        person has undergone and the consequences of such treatment and that it 
        was clear from the Australian authorities that post-operative 
        transsexuals will normally be members of their reassigned sex: paras 
        328-329. He held that a marriage which "Kevin" had entered into with 
        "Jennifer" on 21 August 1999 was a valid marriage under Australian law.

        that decision is to be found in the following paragraphs: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P>
        <UL>"110. The definition of 'marriage' is essentially connected with 
          the term 'man'. In these circumstances, for the reasons stated by the 
          trial judge as amplified by our reasons that appear subsequently, we 
          take the view that the words 'marriage' and 'man' are not technical 
          terms and should be given their ordinary contemporary meaning in the 
          context of the Marriage Act. 
          <P></P></UL>
        <P>
        <UL>111. In our view, it thus becomes a question of fact as to what 
          the contemporary, everyday meanings of the words 'marriage' and 'man' 
          are respectively. 
          <P></P></UL>
        <P>
        <UL>112. It is then a question of law for this court to determine 
          whether, on the facts found by the trial judge, it was open to him to 
          reach the conclusion that he did, namely that at the relevant time, 
          Kevin was a man and that the marriage was therefore valid. As it was 
          in <I>SRA </I>(supra) so, too, it is that the answer to that question 
          is '<I>at the heart of the present case'</I> ." 
          <P></P></UL>
        <LI value=62><A name=para62>I need hardly say that I entirely agree with 
        the Australian judges that the words "male" and "female" in section 
        11(c)of the 1973 Act, which is the provision with which we are faced in 
        this case, are not technical terms and that they must be given their 
        ordinary, everyday meaning in the English language. But no evidence was 
        placed before us to suggest that in contemporary usage in this country, 
        on whichever date one might wish to select - 23 May 1973 when the 1973 
        Act was enacted, 2 May 1981 when Mr and Mrs Bellinger entered into their 
        marriage ceremony or the date of this judgment, these words can be taken 
        to include post-operative transsexual persons. The definition of "male" 
        in the <I>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</I> (1993) tells us that 
        its primary meaning when used as an adjective is "of, pertaining to, or 
        designating the sex which can beget offspring". No mention is made 
        anywhere in the extended definition of the word of transsexual persons. 
        The word "transsexual" is defined as "having the physical 
        characteristics of one sex but a strong and persistent desire to belong 
        to the other." I see no escape from the conclusion that these 
        definitions, with which the decision in <I>Corbett v Corbett</I> [1971] 
        P 83 and the views of the majority in the Court of Appeal in this case 
        are consistent, are both complete and accurate. The fact is that the 
        ordinary meaning of the word "male" is incapable, without more, of 
        accommodating the transsexual person within its scope. The Australian 
        cases show that a distinction has to be drawn, even according to the 
        contemporary usage of the word in Australia, between pre-operative and 
        post-operative transsexuals. Distinctions of that kind raise questions 
        of fact and degree which are absent from the ordinary meaning of the 
        word "male" in this country. Any attempt to enlarge its meaning would be 
        bound to lead to difficulty, as there is no single agreed criterion by 
        which it could be determined whether or not a transsexual was 
        sufficiently "male" for the purpose of entering into a valid marriage 
        ceremony. </A>

        it remains the case, as the court held in <I>Sheffield and Horsham v 
        United Kingdom</I> (1998) 27 EHRR 163, that a transsexual cannot acquire 
        all the biological characteristics of the assigned sex. It went on to 
        say that it was not apparent in the light of increasingly sophisticated 
        surgery and hormonal techniques that the chromosomal element, which is 
        the principal unchanging biological aspect of gender identity, must 
        inevitably take on decisive significance for the purpose of legal 
        attribution of gender identity for post-operative transsexuals. So it 
        was not persuaded that the state of medical science or scientific 
        knowledge provided any determining argument as regards the legal 
        recognition of transsexuals on grounds of social and legal policy. But 
        this approach is not at all inconsistent with the view which I would 
        take of the facts. The question which the court was asking itself was 
        not whether the applicant, who was of the male sex when she was born, 
        was now female. Post-operative transsexuals were assumed to fall into a 
        distinct category. The question was whether it was a breach of their 
        Convention rights for legal recognition to be denied to their new sexual 
        identity. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=64><A name=para64>Of course, it is not given to every man or 
        every woman to have, or to want to have, children. But the ability to 
        reproduce one's own kind lies at the heart of all creation, and the 
        single characteristic which invariably distinguishes the adult male from 
        the adult female throughout the animal kingdom is the part which each 
        sex plays in the act of reproduction. When Parliament used the words 
        "male" and female" in section 11(c) of the 1973 Act it must be taken to 
        have used those words in the sense which they normally have when they 
        are used to describe a person's sex, even though they are plainly 
        capable of including men and women who happen to be infertile or are 
        past the age of child bearing. I think that section 5(4)(e) of the 
        Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977, which provides there is a legal impediment 
        to a marriage in Scots law where the parties "are of the same sex", has 
        to be read and understood in the same way. I do not see how, on the 
        ordinary methods of interpretation, the words "male" and "female" in 
        section 11(c) of the 1973 Act can be interpreted as including female to 
        male and male to female transsexuals. </A>

        11(c) of the 1973 Act was ambiguous, it would have been possible to have 
        regard to that decision in seeking to resolve the ambiguity. But, for 
        the reasons which I have given, I do not think that there is any such 
        ambiguity. Then there is section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, 
        which places a duty on the courts to read and give effect to legislation 
        in a way that is compatible with the Convention rights if it is possible 
        to do so. But we are being asked in this case to make a declaration 
        about the validity of a marriage ceremony which was entered into on 2 
        May 1981, and section 3(1) of the 1998 Act is not retrospective: <I>R v

        <LI value=68><A name=para68>If the only problem of interpretation had 
        been one of timing, on the view that section 11(c) regards "male" and 
        "female" as something that cannot be changed after birth whereas other 
        provisions in the same section such as section 11(b) relate to the 
        position at the time the marriage is entered into, I would have been 
        prepared to read the words "at the time of the marriage" in to section 
        11(c) so as to give that provision a meaning which was compatible with 
        the article 12 Convention right. If the only obstacle was that the 
        parties' sex at the time when they were born had been assumed wrongly to 
        be immutable, it could be overcome by disregarding the niceties of 
        language and finding a compatible construction by reading these words 
        in. But that would only have solved the problem for the future if it 
        could indeed be said that Mrs Bellinger had completely changed her sex 
        since birth and that she was now female. That, for the reasons I have 
        sought to explain, is not a possible view of the facts. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=69><A name=para69>Her problem would be solved if it were 
        possible for a transsexual to marry a person of the same sex, which is 
        indeed what the European Court of Human Rights has now held should be 
        the position in <I>Goodwin</I>. The court noted in para 100 of its 
        judgment that article 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
        European Union had departed "no doubt deliberately" from the wording of 
        article 12 of the Convention in removing the reference to "men and women 
        of marriageable age." Article 9 of the Charter states simply that "the 
        right to marry" shall be guaranteed. The note to article 9 says that it 
        neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to 
        unions between people of the same sex. It appears that the European 
        Court saw that article as opening up the possibility of transsexuals 
        marrying persons of the opposite sex to their post-operative acquired 
        gender, as it rendered arguments about whether they were in act of the 
        opposite sex irrelevant. By this route, which bypasses the physical 
        problems which are inherent in the notion of a complete sex change, 
        legal recognition can be given to the acquired gender of post-operative 
        transsexuals. But it is quite impossible to hold that section 11(c) of 
        the 1973 Act treats the sex of the parties to a marriage ceremony as 
        irrelevant, as it makes express provision to the contrary. In any event, 
        problems of great complexity would be involved if recognition were to be 
        given to same sex marriages. They must be left to Parliament. I do not 
        think that your Lordships can solve the problem judicially by means of 
        the interpretative obligation in section 3(1) of the 1998 Act. </A>

        a purported marriage under English law was s.11 of the Matrimonial 
        Causes Act 1973: "A marriage celebrated after 31st July 1971 shall be 
        void on the following grounds only, that is to say - ..... (c) that the 
        parties are not respectively male and female; ...." The appellant gave

        describing herself as a "spinster". Like your Lordships I will use the 
        words 'she' or 'her' in relation to the appellant without begging the

        refusal by domestic law to recognise 'transsexual' marriages (a term to 
        which I will have to revert) did not contravene Article 12 of the 
        Convention. The judgment in <I>Goodwin</I> expressly recognised that 
        this had been the result of the earlier cases of <I>Rees</I>, 
        <I>Cossey</I>, and <I>Sheffield and Horsham</I>: see paragraphs 73-75

        judgment the appellant would have had no basis for any attack upon 
        propriety of s.11 of the 1973 Act. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=74><A name=para74>The judgment in <I>Goodwin</I> is, if I may 
        say so, thoughtful and appreciates the complexity of the problems 
        created for many aspects of the law by a novel recognition of the 
        concept of a voluntary <I>change</I> of gender. The new approach may 
        reflect new social attitudes to questions of sexuality but the more 
        specific changes in society and the law which should follow from the 
        recognition of the new attitudes are much more difficult to evaluate and 
        provide for. For example, in the present context, to what extent do you 
        change the fundamental concept of marriage? What new criteria do you 
        apply? Once you make this change, how do you, in a non-discriminatory 
        way, deal with mere cohabitees or with homosexuals of the same gender? 
        The judgment refers in paragraph 91 and the preceding paragraphs to the 
        report of the UK Interdepartmental Working Group (April 2000) and the 
        very substantial difficulties which it identified but also pointed out 
        that they were not considered to be insuperable. The Court also observed 
        in paragraph 103 that "though there is widespread acceptance of the 
        marriage of transsexuals, fewer countries permit the marriage of 
        transsexuals in their assigned gender than recognise the change of 
        gender itself". However the Court concluded that there had been a breach 
        of, <I>inter alia</I>, Article 12 because, although the Member States 
        must be given a reasonable opportunity to decide how to revise their 
        national legislation and make the appropriate changes, there came a time 
        when the United Kingdom's continued failure to do so amounted to a 
        denial of the right to marry protected by Article 12: see paragraphs 52, 
        53, 102-4, and 120. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=75><A name=para75>The present case concerns a 'transsexual', 
        that is to say, someone who wishes to change her existing gender and 
        assume the opposite gender. This case is not concerned with gender 
        mis-assignment nor with mixed or 'intersex' gender. The appellant was 
        born a male with all the characteristics of a male. She was correctly 
        assigned the male gender at birth and in her birth certificate. In 
        1967/8, when 21, she married a woman. (She did not disclose this fact to 
        the registrar in 1981.) But the marriage was childless and did not last; 
        they were divorced in 1975. She assumed the female gender dressing and 
        living as a woman. In February 1981, following hormone treatment from a 
        specialist, she underwent gender reassignment surgery as described by my 
        noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls. This was irreversible in the 
        sense that thereafter she could never be fully restored so as to be an 
        anatomically complete male. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=76><A name=para76>Gender reassignment is an established 
        medical procedure in various stages involving both diagnoses by the 
        specialist and informed choices being made by the patient. There was 
        uncontested expert evidence given about this at the trial. Conveniently, 
        it is also summarised in the judgment in <I>Goodwin</I>. The condition 
        of dissatisfaction with one's sexuality at a level justifying medical 
        intervention is a medically recognised mental disorder (DSM-IV). It 
        reflects a pathological degree of dissatisfaction with one's existing 
        gender. The specialist has to study the patient over a period of time 
        and confirm the diagnosis and ascertain that the patient is definitely 
        willing to take the next steps. Firstly the patient must become used to 
        living as a member of the opposite sex. Then the patient will be given 
        courses of hormone treatment to change his/her hormonal make-up to that 
        of the preferred sex. This reinforces the social changes already 
        undertaken. Finally various degrees of gender reassignment surgery are 
        undertaken. It is not until this last stage that the changes may become 
        anatomically irreversible. At any previous stage the patient may change 
        his/her mind and decide that he/she does not want to make the change or 
        not go any further. In the present case the appellant was steadfast in 
        her intentions and went as far as she could, given the considerable 
        limitations of gender reassignment. But the question of transsexualism 
        includes definitional questions of how far the person must go in order 
        to qualify as a transsexual. Is merely assuming the life and clothing of 
        a woman enough or must it include irreversible gender reassignment? Or 
        something in between? There are cogent arguments against adopting any 
        specific criterion. A further question which arises is referred to in 
        paragraph 50 of the <I>Goodwin</I> judgment, noting: "Many people revert 
        to their biological sex after living for some time in the opposite sex 
        and some alternate between the two sexes throughout their lives." All 
        this underlines the novelty of the idea of gender by choice and how 
        great a departure it represents from the pre-<I>Goodwin</I> human rights 
        law and the previous understanding of what the words "respectively male 
        and female" meant. Similar fundamental novelties and changes in the use 
        of language, culturally controversial, are involved in giving effect to 
        the ECtHR's interpretation of the word "marry" in Article 12. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=77><A name=para77>The appellant's primary claim was for a 
        declaration under s.55 of the Family Law Act 1986 that her marriage to 
        Mr Bellinger in 1981 was "at its inception a valid marriage". For the 
        reasons given by my noble and learned friends and for the additional 
        reasons I have given and those to be given by my noble and learned 
        friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the claim must fail and the appeal be 
        dismissed. The 1981 wedding was not valid. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=78><A name=para78>But that still leaves the question whether 
        the House should make a declaration of incompatibility under s.4 of the 
        Human Rights Act 1998. The threshold question is whether, by applying 
        s.3, it is possible, as a matter of interpretation, to 'read down' s.11 
        (c) of the 1973 Act so as to include additional words such as "or two 
        people of the same sex one of whom has changed his/her sex to that of 
        the opposite sex". This would in my view not be an exercise in 
        interpretation however robust. It would be a legislative exercise of 
        amendment making a legislative choice as to what precise amendment was 
        appropriate. Counsel for the Lord Chancellor on behalf of the Government 
        did not argue otherwise. Counsel also did not argue that <I>Goodwin</I> 
        was wrongly decided nor that the UK was not under a treaty obligation to 
        comply with it. But, effectively repeating arguments made unsuccessfully 
        in Strasbourg, submitted that the House should not exercise its 
        discretion under s.4 having regard to the difficulty of deciding upon 
        new policies and drafting new legislation. These difficulties exist but 
        much time has elapsed; the Working Group reported in April 2000; the 
        Court of Appeal commented as strongly as it was proper for them to do so 
        at the lack of progress in July 2001 and the ECtHR has made its decision 
        in <I>Goodwin</I> on the basis that the permitted time for compliance 
        has expired. The argument for further time is now itself incompatible 
        with the rights conferred by the Convention. </A>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=79><A name=para79>But counsel also argued that, in view of his 
        concession that <I>Goodwin</I> bound the United Kingdom, any declaration 
        would be academic and its purpose was merely to confer a power to 
        expedite legislation under s.10. These arguments must be rejected. The 
        Appellant and Mr Bellinger in exercise of their rights under Article 12 
        would wish to enter into a valid marriage as soon as the UK legislation 
        enables them to do so. Others may wish to do the same. The Government 
        can not yet give any assurance about the introduction of compliant 
        legislation. There will be political costs in both the drafting and 
        enactment of new legislation and the legislative time it will occupy. 
        The incompatibility having been established, the declaration under s.4 
        should be made. </A>

        agree with them and, for the reasons they give, I too would make the 
        declaration of incompatibility which they propose but would otherwise 
        dismiss the appeal. I add a point about the language of the relevant 
        legislation. </A>

        <LI value=82><A name=para82>The submissions for Mrs Bellinger presuppose 
        that, in relation to marriage, English law envisages that a person's 
        gender can alter. The form of section 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes 
        Act 1973 indicates that this is not so. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
        <LI value=83><A name=para83>Section 11(c) is a re-enactment of section 
        1(c) of the Nullity of Marriage Act 1971 which was passed shortly after 
        the decision in <I>Corbett v Corbett</I> [1971] P 83. Section 11(c) 
        contains one in a series of grounds of nullity. By section 11(b) a 
        marriage is void if "at the time of the marriage either party was 
        already lawfully married". The reference to the situation at the time of 
        the marriage is necessary because a person may have been lawfully 
        married at an earlier time and may be lawfully married at a later time. 
        The situation is one that can change. For purposes of nullity the 
        critical consideration is what the situation was "at the time of the 
        marriage" in question. Similarly, section 11(d) provides that a 
        polygamous marriage entered into outside England and Wales is void if 
        "either party was at the time of the marriage domiciled in England and 
        Wales". Again, when dealing with domicile which can change, Parliament 
        uses the past tense and specifies the time of the marriage. Section 
        11(c) is different in both respects: a marriage is void if "the parties 
        are not respectively male and female". Both the present tense and the 
        omission of any reference to the time of the marriage indicate that, in 
        relation to the validity of marriage, Parliament regards gender as fixed 
        and immutable. </A>
