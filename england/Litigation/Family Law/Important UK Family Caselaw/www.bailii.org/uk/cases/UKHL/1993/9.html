<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is desirable
that something should be said about the level of
separate<BR>representation of parties, all at public expense, which
was a feature of this<BR>appeal. The appellant proceeding through his
guardian ad litem was<BR>represented by solicitors and by senior and
junior counsel funded by the Legal<BR>Aid Board, and rightly so.
Birmingham City Council, which supported the<BR>appeal, was similarly
represented, at the expense of the Birmingham<BR>community charge or
council tax payers. Separate solicitors and also senior<BR>and junior
counsel appeared for each of the mother, the father and the<BR>guardian
ad litem to the mother. These three had lodged a joint written
case.<BR>The mother and the father were funded by the Legal Aid
Board, and the<BR>mother's guardian ad litem by Birmingham City
Council. There was no<BR>significant difference between the arguments
for those who supported the<BR>appeal or between the arguments for
those who resisted it. In the<BR>circumstances there must be a
serious question whether the degree of separate<BR>representation was
necessary, or in any event whether the employment of so<BR>many
senior counsel was justified. It is to be hoped that in future cases
where<BR>a similar question may arise serious consideration will be
given by solicitors<BR>and counsel to the practicability and
desirability where appropriate of securing<BR>joint representation
with a view to minimising the burden on public funds.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

J. in his judgment, given after a five day hearing, set out the<BR>facts
in detail. It is sufficient for present purposes to summarise them.
M<BR>lived from an early age with her grandmother, then with foster
parents and<BR>subsequently in May, 1979 she was adopted. Her
behaviour caused serious<BR>problems at home and in two different
units for adolescents to which she was<BR>moved and where she
assaulted members of the staff. After R's birth, she<BR>was
apparently for a while able to look after him satisfactorily but as
time<BR>went on it was found that she was handling him roughly. On
one occasion in<BR>February 1992 a doctor feared that her roughness
would cause R bony injury.<BR>M and R subsequently went to live in
premises specially provided for mothers<BR>with young children. There
were disturbances involving both M and R, on<BR>occasion M fighting
with other residents and assaulting members of staff.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 1.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>They
were moved to an emergency facility in what is called a &quot;crash<BR>pad&quot;
and later to a college in Taunton. Here aggressive outbursts and
assaults<BR>by M led to anxiety about R's safety and well-being and R
was taken to foster<BR>parents. A guardian ad litem was appointed for
each of them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 1.51cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>An
attempt to reunite M with her natural parents and in particular
with<BR>her grandmother failed and after M went to live in local
authority<BR>accommodation she was violent and absconded from time to
time. During<BR>1992 contact was arranged between M and R which at
times was satisfactory<BR>but unfortunately instances of rough or
unsuitable handling of the baby<BR>occurred. There were further
assaults on staff by M and on several occasions<BR>she inflicted
wounds on herself and took an overdose of tablets. Between the<BR>end
of August and 16 October 1992 she absconded on 13 occasions and
said<BR>she had been soliciting. From the end of October 1992 until
the hearing<BR>brought before Connell J. she was in secure
accommodation when again<BR>unhappy incidents occurred. M's
immaturity and inability to put the interests<BR>of the child first
led the judge to conclude that there was a strong likelihood<BR>that
R would suffer significant harm due to inadequate care on the pan of
this<BR>mother. The judge had no doubt that M was beyond parental
control and that<BR>she was suffering, and was likely to suffer,
significant harm attributable to her<BR>being beyond parental
control.</FONT></FONT></P>

judge, supported by both guardians ad litem, concluded that it
was<BR>very unlikely that R would make significant progress within
twelve months<BR>and that she did not have the ability to look after
R. Nor was A prepared to<BR>offer any significant support. It was
important that R should be adopted as<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

very<BR>necessary.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 1.54cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>As
to contact, the judge accepted that only in exceptional
circumstances<BR>should contact between a mother and a young baby
child be prevented and that<BR>the court had to face the prospect
that M might make further attempts to injure<BR>herself if she was
prevented from seeing R. However, the judge, after<BR>carefully
considering the evidence, including views of M's mother, her<BR>guardian
ad litem and A, took the view that occasional contact in
secure<BR>accommodation as proposed could prove distressing both for
M and for R and<BR>that there was a clear risk of physical harm to R.</FONT></FONT></P>

said, &quot;So far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, it is

of the child, not of the<BR>parent. Where conflict arises, his
welfare, therefore, takes priority over [M's]<BR>welfare.</FONT></FONT></P>

was supported<BR>by A. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed,
that as to the latter was<BR>allowed and no order was made as to

related to the up-<BR>bringing of M. It was impossible to give each

parent and child were both children, the<BR>latter's interests were
to prevail. On the contrary, while the welfare of M and<BR>R taken
together, is to be considered as paramount to the interests of
any<BR>adults concerned in their lives, as between themselves the

point is that by subsection (1) the appropriate authority<BR>must
allow the child in care reasonable contact with four categories of
person,<BR>a parent, a guardian, a person in whose favour a residence
order was in force,<BR>or a person who has had the care of the child
immediately before the care<BR>order in question was made. If there
is an issue about contact any one of<BR>those persons may apply to
the court under subsection (3) and the court, &quot;may<BR>make such
order as it considers appropriate with respect to the contact
which<BR>is to be allowed between the child and that person&quot;.
For this purpose, &quot;the<BR>child&quot; is the child in care in
respect of whom an order is sought by one of the<BR>four categories
of person. That child is the subject matter of the application.<BR>The
question to be determined relates to that child's upbringing and it
is that<BR>child's welfare which must be the court's paramount
consideration. The fact<BR>that the parent is also a child does not
mean that both parent's and child's<BR>welfare is paramount and that
each has to be balanced against the other.<BR>Under subsection (3)
the question to be determined does not relate to the<BR>applicant's
upbringing even if the applicant is a child.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

(2), &quot;on an application made by the authority or the<BR>child,
the court may make such order as it considers appropriate with

and any named<BR>person&quot;. In this application the child in care
may apply and, if that child is<BR>the applicant, it is that child's
welfare which is directly involved and which<BR>is paramount even if
the other &quot;named person&quot; is also a child. The welfare<BR>of

doubted whether a parent was ever intended to be included<BR>within
the category of &quot;child&quot; in section 34(2) even if the parent
is also a<BR>child. In any event an order under subsection (2) does
not legally oblige the<BR>person named to have contact with the

one of the four<BR>categories of person mentioned above who are named
in the order. Thus the<BR>court may authorise refusal to allow
contact between the child in care and the<BR>parent. The child in
respect of whose upbringing a question is to be<BR>determined by the
court is the son or daughter of the parent named in the<BR>order and
it is that child's welfare which is to be paramount. The fact that
the<BR>parent is also a child does not require the balancing exercise

34(5) of the Act the court has<BR>power to make an order under
section 34 in any family proceedings in<BR>connection with a child in
care, even though no application for an order has<BR>been made with
respect to the child. Accordingly when the court is seised of<BR>family
proceedings, which include proceedings under Part IV of the Act,
the<BR>court may consider whether an order should be made under
section 34(2) of<BR>the Act whether or not an application had been
made by M as a child for<BR>contact with R as the named person. It
was therefore not necessary to<BR>consider whether, in the

subsection (3) when a question arose as to R's<BR>upbringing and when
his welfare was paramount. And it was of no value to<BR>make an order

question as to<BR>whether he should make such an order very careful
consideration, giving due<BR>weight to the fact that such an order
prohibiting contact between a mother and<BR>a young child should
rarely be made and it is impossible to say that he erred<BR>in the
exercise of his discretion in a way which would justify an
appellate<BR>court from setting it aside. It is further to be noted
that between February<BR>1993, the date of the Court of Appeal's
judgment, when contact again became<BR>possible, and the date of the
hearing before your Lordships' House, M saw<BR>R only three times,
all under supervision, the last being on the 18 August,<BR>1993. A
