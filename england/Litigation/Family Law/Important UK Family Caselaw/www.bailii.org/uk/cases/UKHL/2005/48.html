      <P align=center>THURSDAY 14 JULY 2005</P>
      <P align=left>The Appellate Committee comprised:</P>

      <P>My Lords,</P>
      <OL>
        <LI value=1><A name=para1>&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant (Mrs Kehoe) married 
        Mr Kehoe in 1983. They had four children. The marriage broke down in May 
        1993, a petition for divorce was filed by Mrs Kehoe in December 1993 and 
        Mr Kehoe left the family home at the beginning of 1994. The children 
        remained with Mrs Kehoe, who invoked the services of the Child Support 
        Agency ("the CSA") to obtain financial support for the upbringing of the 
        children from Mr Kehoe. Over the next ten years significant sums of 
        money for the support of the children were paid by Mr Kehoe in response 
        to demands by the CSA, but the process of obtaining payment was 
        protracted and difficult and substantial arrears built up from time to 
        time. Mrs Kehoe strongly feels, perhaps rightly, that direct action by 
        her against her former husband would have yielded more satisfactory 
        results. She contends that, properly understood, the Child Support Act 
        1991 gives her a right to recover financial support for the children 
        from Mr Kehoe and that the provisions of the Act purporting to deny her 
        a power of direct enforcement against him are inconsistent with the 
        right of access to a court guaranteed by article 6 of the European 
        Convention on Human Rights. At issue in this appeal is the correctness 
        of that contention. </A>

        <LI value=3><A name=para3>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary first to examine 
        whether Mrs Kehoe has a right to recover financial support for the 
        maintenance of the children (which I shall call "child maintenance") 
        from Mr Kehoe under the domestic law of England and Wales: <I>Matthews v 
        Ministry of Defence</I> <A 
        href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/4.html">[2003] UKHL 4</a></A>, <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/4.html">[2003] 1 AC 1163</a></A>, para 3. Under the law as it stood before 1991 it was 
        clear that she had such a right under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, 
        the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates' Courts Act 1978, the 
        Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and the Children Act 1989: 
        see the judgment of Ward LJ, paras 11-16 and section 8(11) of the 1991 
        Act. But these procedures were judged by the government of the day to be 
        unsatisfactory, for reasons summarised in para 2 of the Summary in a 
        White Paper "Children Come First" vol I (Cm 1264) presented to 
        Parliament in October 1990: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of maintenance is 
          unnecessarily fragmented, uncertain in its results, slow and 
          ineffective. It is based largely on discretion. The system is operated 
          through the High and county courts, the magistrates' courts, the Court 
          of Session and the Sheriff Courts in Scotland and the offices of the 
          Department of Social Security. The cumulative effect is uncertainty 
          and inconsistent decisions about how much maintenance should be paid. 
          In a great many instances, the maintenance awarded is not paid or the 
          payments fall into arrears and take weeks to re-establish. Only 30 per 
          cent of lone mothers and 3 per cent of lone fathers receive regular 
          maintenance for their children. More than 750,000 lone parents depend 
          on Income Support. Many lone mothers want to go to work but do not 
          feel able to do so."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>It was proposed (Summary, para 6) to create a Child Support Agency 
        which would have responsibilities for the assessment, review, collection 
        and enforcement of maintenance payments, with powers to collect 
        information on incomes and obligations, make a legally binding 
        assessment of what was payable, determine methods of payment, monitor 
        and (where necessary) collect maintenance and enforce payment where 
        payments failed. Once the CSA was fully established, all claims for 
        maintenance and reviews of maintenance would be handled by the CSA and 
        not by the courts (Summary, para 8). The CSA was to have responsibility 
        for the assessment, collection and enforcement of maintenance payments 
        (chapter 2, para 2.2). It was regarded as important that, as far as 
        possible, all the services relating to child maintenance provided to the 
        public should be delivered by one single authority, the CSA, for which 
        it should be a priority to secure payment to the caring parent as 
        quickly and accurately as possible (chapter 5, para 5.2). It was to take 
        appropriate enforcement action at an early date when payments were not 
        made (chapter 5, para 5.3). The White Paper outlined the proposed means 
        of enforcement, and stated (chapter 5, paras 5.20, 5.24):</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"Taking enforcement action</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>5.20&nbsp;&nbsp;If enforcement action is to be effective, 
          it has to be taken quickly. It is therefore proposed that, when a 
          parent first commissions the Child Support Agency to take enforcement 
          action on her behalf, that parent should give a standing authority for 
          the Agency to take action if and when full payment is not made on 
          time. If the Agency were required to seek specific authority to act in 
          every instance, then that could only cause additional 
delay.</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>5.24&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage, and very much a last 
          resort, would be for the Agency to apply to the court for the court to 
          take action. It is to be expected that the other measures, already 
          described, will be more effective and it should be necessary to apply 
          to the courts only very rarely. In England and Wales, the courts have 
          the power to impose deferred prison sentences, where the debtor is 
          committed to prison if the debt has not been paid in a specified 
          period of time, or immediate prison sentences."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>It was to be open to parents who were able to reach agreement to 
        resolve the issue of child maintenance between themselves, whether or 
        not in a sum assessed by the CSA, provided the caring parent was not in 
        receipt of benefit from the state (chapter 5, para 5.26).</P>
        <LI value=4><A name=para4>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Child Support Act 1991 gave 
        effect to the scheme foreshadowed by the White Paper. It imposed a 
        responsibility for maintaining a qualifying child on each parent 
        (section 1(1)). It imposed a duty on the absent or non-resident parent 
        to make payment of child maintenance in any periodical sums assessed 
        (section 1(3)). It obliged the Secretary of State, on the application of 
        either parent, to assess the child maintenance payable according to a 
        statutory formula (sections 4, 11). It empowered the Secretary of State 
        to take enforcement action if authorised to do so (sections 4, 6). It 
        gave the Secretary of State significant powers (sections 14, 15, 30, 31, 
        33, 35, 36, 39A). While the role of the courts was preserved in relation 
        to consensual settlements reached by parents not in receipt of state 
        benefit (section 8), and there can be no doubt of the Secretary of 
        State's duty to account to the caring parent for sums which he has 
        received from the paying parent, subject to any appropriate deduction of 
        benefit, the Act conferred no right of recovery or enforcement on a 
        caring parent such as Mrs Kehoe against an absent or non-resident parent 
        such as Mr Kehoe. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=5><A name=para5>&nbsp;&nbsp;In <I>Department of Social 
        Security v Butler</I> [1995] 1 WLR 1528 the issue was whether the court 
        could grant a Mareva injunction to the Secretary of State against an 
        absent or non-resident parent who had failed to make the payments 
        assessed under the 1991 Act. Evans LJ, at pp 1531-1532 said: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"The following observations may be made on these statutory 
          provisions. (1) The Act of 1991 together with regulations made under 
          it provide a detailed and apparently comprehensive code for the 
          collection of payments due under maintenance assessments and the 
          enforcement of liability orders made on the application of the 
          Secretary of State. (2) The only method provided for enforced 
          collection before a liability order is made is a deduction from 
          earnings order made by the Secretary of State himself under section 
          31. (3) Although section 1(3) provides for a duty which arises when 
          the maintenance assessment is made, this duty is not expressed as a 
          civil debt. Mr Crampin accepts that the duty could not be directly 
          enforced by action in any civil court, or by any means other than as 
          provided in the Act. (4) There is no provision for precautionary or 
          <I>Mareva</I>-style relief."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Morritt LJ agreed at pp 1540-1541:</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"As I have indicated the Secretary of State claims in 
          respect of the statutory right correlative with the obligation 
          expressed in section 1(3) of the Act of 1991. But that obligation and 
          right is not a civil debt in any ordinary sense. First, the obligation 
          may only be enforced by the Secretary of State and not by any other 
          person who may be stated to be the payee in the maintenance 
          assessment. Secondly, the Secretary of State's powers of enforcement 
          do not enable him to sue for the arrears in the ordinary way. In the 
          first instance his choice lies between a deduction of earnings order 
          directed to the employer or an application to justices for a liability 
          order. In my judgment, neither of those rights is such as would 
          entitle this court, consistently with the decision in <I>The Veracruz 
          I</I> [1992] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 353 to grant <I>Mareva</I> 
        relief.</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>The Child Support Act 1991 introduced a wholly new 
          framework for the assessment and collection of the sums required for 
          the maintenance of children by their parents. There is no provision 
          for the enforcement of any maintenance assessment except by the 
          Secretary of State and his methods of enforcement are limited in the 
          way I have mentioned. It seems to me that it would be inconsistent 
          with the Act as a whole in general and with section 33 in particular 
          if the Secretary of State were to be at liberty to apply for 
          <I>Mareva</I> injunctions in the High Court. If the conditions in 
          section 33(1) are satisfied then Parliament has clearly laid down that 
          the Secretary of State should proceed first in the magistrates' court 
          and then in the county court. If those conditions are not satisfied 
          then Parliament has clearly ordained that the Secretary of State 
          should not be entitled to enforce the maintenance assessment by court 
          process at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>No doubt clear words or a necessary implication are 
          required to exclude the jurisdiction of the court. The suggested 
          exclusion in this case is of the High Court's ordinary civil 
          jurisdiction which includes the power to grant injunctions. In my 
          judgment, the detailed provisions contained in the Act of 1991 which I 
          have described show clearly that Parliament intended that all 
          questions concerning the enforcement of maintenance assessments should 
          be determined exclusively by the Secretary of State, the magistrates' 
          court or the county court. The civil jurisdiction of the High Court 
          is, in my view, necessarily excluded. I agree with Evans LJ that the 
          judge was right and that this application should be 
        dismissed."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Simon Brown LJ also agreed, at p 1541:</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"For my part I believe that the argument fails at both 
          stages albeit for what in the last analysis may be thought essentially 
          the selfsame reason. Put shortly my conclusions are, first, that 
          <I>Mareva</I> relief is only obtainable where there is already 
          available to the applicant a cause of action properly so called, viz. 
          a right to litigate or arbitrate an existing monetary claim, and, 
          secondly, that the Act of 1991 affords to the Secretary of State no 
          such cause of action, and indeed no rights at all save only those 
          expressly conferred upon him by section 4(2) to arrange in certain 
          circumstances either for the 'collection' of maintenance payable under 
          an assessment or for the 'enforcement' of the obligation to pay such 
          maintenance, in each instance as thereafter expressly provided for in 
          sections 29 et seq. of the Act of 1991."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>In <I>Huxley v Child Support Officer</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/3015.html">[2000] 1 FLR 898</a>, 908, Hale 
        LJ, with the concurrence of Auld and Pill LJJ, helpfully characterised 
        the regime established by the 1991 Act:</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"The child support system has elements of private and 
          public law but fundamentally it is a nationalised system for assessing 
          and enforcing an obligation which each parent owes primarily to the 
          child. It replaces the powers of the courts, which can no longer make 
          orders for periodical payments for children save in very limited 
          circumstances. Unless she can secure a voluntary agreement at least as 
          high as that which the CSA would assess, the PWC is expected to look 
          to the Agency to assess her child support according to the formula, 
          whether or not she is on benefit. The fact that it does her no direct 
          good if she is on means-tested benefits, and that much CSA activity so 
          far has been in relation to parents on benefit, does not alter the 
          fundamental characteristics of the scheme."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=6><A name=para6>&nbsp;&nbsp;That a caring parent in the 
        position of Mrs Kehoe was given no right of recovering or enforcing a 
        claim to child maintenance against an absent or non-resident parent was 
        not a lacuna or inadvertent omission in the 1991 Act: it was the essence 
        of the new scheme, a deliberate legislative departure from the regime 
        which had previously obtained. The merits of that scheme are not for the 
        House in its judicial capacity to evaluate. But plainly the scheme did 
        not lack a coherent rationale. The state has an interest, most directly 
        in cases where public funds are disbursed, but also more generally that 
        children should be adequately supported. It might well be thought that a 
        single professional agency, with the resources of the state behind it 
        and an array of powers at its command, would be more consistent in 
        assessing and more effective and economical in enforcing payment than 
        individual parents acting in a random and uncoordinated way. It might 
        also be thought that the interposition of an independent, neutral, 
        official body would reduce the acrimony which had all too frequently 
        characterised applications for child maintenance by caring against 
        absent or non-resident parents in the past which, however understandable 
        in the aftermath of a fractured relationship, rarely enured to the 
        benefit of the children. For better or worse, the process was 
        deliberately changed. </A>

        <LI value=7><A name=para7>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1991 Act cannot in my opinion 
        be interpreted as conferring any right on a parent in the position of 
        Mrs Kehoe. She is of course the person to whom child maintenance will be 
        paid, directly or indirectly and subject to any deduction of benefit, as 
        the person who incurs the expense of bringing up the children. But the 
        right which she had enjoyed under the former legislation was removed, 
        and the right to recover the maintenance has been vested in the CSA. 
</A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=8><A name=para8>&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion is not fatal to 
        Mrs Kehoe's argument, but it is very highly damaging. For while the 
        Strasbourg authorities are not bound by the classifications of national 
        law, it is clear that the function of article 6 of the Convention is to 
        guarantee certain important procedural safeguards in the exercise of 
        rights accorded by national law and not ordinarily to require that 
        particular substantive rights be accorded by national law: <I>James v 
        United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 123</a>, para 81; <I>H v Belgium</I> (1987)

        a right to recover child maintenance from her former husband, article 6 
        would guarantee her access to an impartial and independent court where 
        her claim would be fairly determined. But article 6 does not require 
        that she have such a right. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=9><A name=para9>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that any of the 
        Strasbourg jurisprudence to which the House was referred throws doubt on 
        that conclusion. In <I>Golder v United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1975/1.html">(1975) 1 EHRR 524</a>, it 
        is true, the Court found a violation of Mr Golder's rights under article 
        6(1) in the denial of access to a solicitor. But the Court interpreted 
        article 6(1) as conferring a right of access to a court (see paras 28-36 
        of the judgment); it was plain that this right would have been valueless 
        had Mr Golder been unable to obtain legal advice; and there was no doubt 
        about his right in principle to sue for defamation. I do not think any 
        principle can be extrapolated from this case to assist Mrs Kehoe. In 
        <I>Ashingdane v United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1985/8.html">(1985) 7 EHRR 528</a>, para 54, the Court 
        found it unnecessary to decide whether the right which the applicant 
        sought to assert in this country was, in Convention terms, a "civil 
        right". In <I>Philis v Greece</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1991/38.html">(1991) 13 EHRR 741</a> the right which the 
        applicant had sought to assert in the national court was to professional 
        fees for which he had contracted and which (he claimed) he had earned. 
        There is, again, no principle which can be extrapolated to assist Mrs 
        Kehoe. </A>

        with Mrs Kehoe, who appears to have suffered extreme frustration and a 
        measure of loss, one cannot in my opinion ignore the wider principle 
        raised by this case. This is that the deliberate decisions of 
        representative assemblies should be respected and given effect so long 
        as they do not infringe rights guaranteed by the Convention. As they 
        have made clear, it is not for the Strasbourg institutions, under the 
        guise of applying the procedural guarantees in article 6, to impose 
        legislative models on member states. Whether the scheme established by 
        the 1991 Act is on balance beneficial to those whom it is intended to 
        benefit may well be open to question, but it is a question for 
        Parliament to resolve and not for the courts, since I do not consider 
        that any article 6 right of Mrs Kehoe is engaged. </A>

        Kehoe filed a petition for divorce. On 24 December 1993 she applied to 
        the Child Support Agency under section 4(1) of the 1991 Act for a

        <P><I>The facts</I></P>
        <LI value=14><A name=para14>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an initial delay by 
        the agency in sending a maintenance inquiry form to Mr Kehoe. It lasted 
        for well over a year, for which Mrs Kehoe has been compensated. The form 
        was eventually sent to him on 25 May 1995. This was the date as from 
        which his liability was to be calculated. He provided insufficient 
        information for a full assessment to be made at that stage, so an 
        interim maintenance assessment was made with effect from 5 October 1995. 
        A full maintenance assessment was made later, but arrears of maintenance 
        due by him since May 1995 began to accumulate. In June 1996 the agency 
        applied in the magistrates' court for a liability order to be made 
        against him under section 33(3) of the 1991 Act. At a hearing on 13 
        August 1996, at which Mrs Kehoe was not present, Mr Kehoe disputed the 
        amount of the arrears. The hearing had to be adjourned for the dispute 
        to be resolved. On 23 September 1996 the agency decided to withdraw the 
        application because the amount of the arrears could not be 
        substantiated. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=15><A name=para15>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrears continued to accumulate, 
        so the agency made a second application for a liability order to cover 
        arrears that had arisen between 25 May 1995 and 11 September 2000. On 15 
        December 2000 this application was granted. Bailiffs were instructed to 
        levy distress, but this was unsuccessful. A deduction from earnings 
        order was issued on 9 October 2001 and it was followed by a further 
        order for an increased amount on 21 February 2002. But Mr Kehoe was a 
        director of the company on which the orders were served, and these steps 
        too were unsuccessful. When he was interviewed by the agency on 21 
        October 2002 Mr Kehoe alleged that two of the children had been living 
        with him for five years and that a third child had moved to live with 
        him recently. He also said that Mrs Kehoe had moved to Spain where she 
        was living with the fourth child. The agency established that Mrs Kehoe 
        had moved to Spain permanently, so it closed her file on 13 January 2003 
        with effect from 30 September 2002. But arrears remain due to Mrs Kehoe 
        which the agency is still seeking to enforce against Mr Kehoe. </A>

        <P></P>
        <LI value=16><A name=para16>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Kehoe was for a time in 
        receipt of child benefit. But she had a part-time job when Mr Kehoe left 
        the family home, and in October 1994 she obtained full-time employment 
        as a secretary. Although she had to struggle to make ends meet, she did 
        not claim income support, family credit or any other benefit of the kind 
        prescribed for the purposes of section 6 of the 1991 Act. So she is not 
        and never has been one of those persons with care who may be required 
        under section 6(1) to authorise the Secretary of State to take action 
        under the Act to recover child support maintenance from the absent 
        parent. Her position is that she was entitled under section 4 of the 
        1991 Act to apply to the Secretary of State for the making of a 
        maintenance assessment. This was done on her own initiative. </A>

        <LI value=18><A name=para18>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which lies at the 
        heart of this case is whether the provisions of the 1991 Act which 
        preclude a person with care from playing any part in the enforcement of 
        maintenance assessments made against the absent parent in response to an 
        application made under section 4 of the Act are compatible with article 
        6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
        Fundamental Freedoms. It should be noted that no challenge is being made 
        in this case to the system which the 1991 Act lays down for the making 
        of the assessments for child support maintenance by the agency. It is 
        not suggested that this part of the system is incompatible with the 
        Convention. It is the enforcement stage of the process only that is 
        being brought under scrutiny. Nor are we concerned in this case with the 
        various situations where the courts retain jurisdiction over claims for 
        the enforcement of the right of children to be maintained by their 
        parents which are outside the system for which responsibility has been 
        placed by the 1991 Act on the agency: for a convenient list, see 
        Wilkinson and Norrie, <I>Parent and Child,</I> 2nd ed (Edinburgh 1999), 
        paras 14.13-14. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=19><A name=para19>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Kehoe's complaint is that 
        the agency delayed unreasonably in taking enforcement action against Mr 
        Kehoe, that the facts asserted by Mr Kehoe which were accepted by the 
        agency when he disputed the amount of the arrears were not correct and 
        that she was precluded by the statutory scheme from intervening on her 
        own behalf for the enforcement of the maintenance assessments. She 
        claims that the effect of the scheme was to restrict her right of access 
        to a court for the determination of her civil rights within the meaning 
        of article 6(1). She seeks a declaration under section 4(2) of the Human 
        Rights Act 1998 that the provisions of the 1991 Act are incompatible 
        with her Convention rights under that article. She also seeks a 
        declaration that her Convention rights were breached by delay on the 
        part of the agency. She claims damages under sections 7 and 8 of the 
        Human Rights Act 1998 with respect to the agency's acts and failures to 
        act for the period from 2 October 2000 when the relevant sections of 
        that Act came into force. </A>

        <LI value=20><A name=para20>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is whether 
        Mrs Kehoe's right to the collection and enforcement of a maintenance 
        assessment made in response to an application made under section 4 of 
        the 1991 Act is a "civil right" within the meaning of article 6(1) of 
        the Convention. If that question is answered in the affirmative, two 
        further questions then arise: whether the scheme which the 1991 Act lays 
        down is nevertheless compatible with the Convention because the duties 
        of the Secretary of State under the Act, being amenable to judicial 
        review, are subject to control by a court having full jurisdiction to 
        deal with the case as the nature of the case requires so as to fulfil

        the parent's access to a court for the enforcement of the maintenance 
        assessment is nevertheless compatible with article 6(1) because it is 
        proportionate. </A>

        <LI value=21><A name=para21>&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive description of 
        the scheme of the 1991 Act, as amended by the Child Support Act 1995 and 
        the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, is set out in 
        the judgments of Wall J in the Administrative Court <A

        <P></P>
        <LI value=22><A name=para22>&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic principles are set out 
        in sections 1 to 10 of the 1991 Act, as originally enacted. It is 
        necessary, to set the scene for this judgment, to mention only some of 
        them. Section 1(1) provides that, for the purposes of the Act, each 
        parent of a qualifying child is responsible for maintaining him. Section 
        1(2) provides: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"For the purposes of this Act, an absent parent shall be 
          taken to have met his responsibility to maintain any qualifying child 
          of his by making periodical payments of maintenance with respect to 
          the child of such amount, and at such intervals, as may be determined 
          in accordance with the provisions of this Act."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Section 3 defines the expressions "qualifying child", "absent parent" 
        and "person with care". A child is a qualifying child if one or both of 
        his parents is, in relation to him, an absent parent. The parent of any 
        child is an absent parent in relation to the child if that parent is not 
        living in the same household with the child and the child has his home 
        with a person who is, in relation to him, a person with care. A person 
        is a person with care in relation to any child if he is a person with 
        whom the child has his home and usually provides day to day care for the 
        child. That person need not be an individual: see section 44(2).</P>
        <LI value=23><A name=para23>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4(1) provides that a 
        person who is, in relation to any qualifying child or any qualifying 
        children, either the person with care or the absent parent may apply to 
        the Secretary of State for a maintenance assessment to be made under the 
        Act with respect to that child or any of those children. That provision 
        is to be contrasted with section 6(1), which provides that where income 
        support, family credit or any other benefit of a prescribed kind is 
        claimed by or in respect of, or paid to or in respect of, the parent of 
        a qualifying child she shall, if she is a person with care of the child 
        and she is required to do so by the Secretary of State, authorise him to 
        take action under the Act to recover child maintenance support from the 
        other parent. The Secretary of State has power to require a parent to 
        authorise the making of an assessment as soon as benefits of the kind 
        there specified are claimed. That is not what happened in Mrs Kehoe's 
        case. So your Lordships are concerned with only maintenance assessments 
        made under section 4, the making of an application for which is at the 
        option of either the person with care or the absent parent. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=24><A name=para24>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 11 provides that any 
        application for a maintenance assessment made to the Secretary of State 
        shall be referred by him to a child support officer, and that the amount 
        of child support maintenance to be fixed by any maintenance assessment 
        shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 
        which provides for its calculation according to an elaborate formula. 
        Once this stage is reached we are in the field of algebra. But 
        fortunately it is not necessary to probe into these details in this 
        case. </A>

        para 17. In summary, it provides that, where a maintenance assessment 
        has been made in response to an application under section 4 and either 
        the person with care or the absent parent with respect to whom the 
        assessment was made applies to him under that subsection, the Secretary 
        of State may arrange for the enforcement of the obligation to pay child 
        support in accordance with the assessment. Section 4(2) must be read 
        together with section 4(3), which provides that where an application for 
        the enforcement of the obligation authorises the Secretary of State to 
        take steps to enforce the obligation whenever he considers it necessary 
        to do so, the Secretary of State may act accordingly. These subsections 
        must also be read together with section 2, which provides that where the 
        Secretary of State is considering the exercise of any discretionary 
        power conferred by the Act, he shall have regard to the welfare of any 
        child likely to be affected by his decision. In practice, of course, 
        applications under section 4 are made not to the Secretary of State 
        himself but to the agency. It is the agency that decides whether or not, 
        in any given case, the discretionary powers which the section confers on 
        the Secretary of State with regard to the enforcement of the obligation 
        to pay child support maintenance should be exercised. </A>

        <LI value=26><A name=para26>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8 deals with the role of 
        the courts with respect to maintenance for children. Subsection (1) 
        provides that it applies in any case where a child support officer would 
        have jurisdiction to make a maintenance assessment with respect to a 
        qualifying child and an absent parent of his on the application of a 
        person entitled to apply for that assessment. The basic rule is set out 
        in subsection (3), which provides: </A>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>"In any case where subsection (1) applies, no court shall

          parent concerned."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=27><A name=para27>&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisdiction of the courts 
        to make orders for the maintenance of children is preserved in the 
        various circumstances described in the remaining subsections of section 
        8. These include cases such as where the court is satisfied that the 
        circumstances of the case make it appropriate for the absent parent to 
        make payments under a maintenance order in addition to the child support 
        maintenance payable by him in accordance with the maintenance 
        assessment: see subsection (6). Parents who have previously been able to 
        agree in writing the level of child maintenance may obtain an order from 
        the court by consent: see subsection (5). Section 9(2) provides that 
        nothing in the Act shall be taken to prevent any person from entering 
        into an agreement for the making of periodical payments by way of 
        maintenance to or for the benefit of any child. But it is unnecessary to 
        explore these details further, as none of these exceptions apply in the 
        case of Mrs Kehoe. </A>

        article 6. I would respectfully follow this guidance. So I must now take 
        a closer look at the effect of the provisions of the 1991 Act, as seen 
        against the background of the previous law which the scheme of the Act 
        was designed to replace. </A>

        <LI value=29><A name=para29>&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of parents' duty to 
        maintain their children at common law and the statutory procedures that 
        were introduced to enable courts to make orders for maintenance to be 
        paid to or for a child's benefit have been described by Ward LJ in the 
        Court of Appeal <A 
        href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/225.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/225.html">[2004] 2 WLR 1481</a></A>, paras 7 to 16, and by my noble and learned friend Baroness 
        Hale of Richmond. At the outset of his summary Ward LJ makes the point 
        that, while there was a common law duty to maintain, the common law 
        provided no remedy. Under English law a wife could neither claim nor 
        enforce any right to maintenance, either for herself or the children, in 
        the civil courts. The gap was filled for the first time by section 35 of 
        the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, which enabled the divorce courts to 
        make provision with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of 
        children, and by section 52 of that Act which provided for the 
        enforcement of these orders. The jurisdiction was continued and enlarged 
        upon in a series of later statutes. For example, the Guardianship of 
        Infants Act 1925 enabled the court to make an order against a parent to 
        pay such weekly or other periodic sum towards the maintenance of his 
        child as, having regard to the means of that parent, it might think 
        reasonable. The current powers are set out in section 15 of and Schedule 
        1 to the Children Act 1989 and, in regard to Scotland, sections 1 to 6 
        of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985. These provisions have not been 
        repealed. But the effect of section 8(3) of the 1991 Act is that the 
        court's power to make maintenance orders under those statutes in 
        relation to a child is no longer available where a child support officer 
        would have jurisdiction to make a maintenance assessment under the 1991 
        Act. </A>

        <LI value=30><A name=para30>&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the 1991 Act, 
        then, is to replace the existing statutory framework with an entirely 
        new scheme. The background to its introduction was explained in

        First</I> (October 1990) (Cm 1264), which stated: </A>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>"The present system of maintenance is unnecessarily 
          fragmented, uncertain in its results, slow and ineffective. It is 
          based largely on discretion. The system is operated through the High 
          and county courts, the magistrates' courts, the Court of Session and 
          the sheriff courts in Scotland and the offices of the Department of 
          Social Security. The cumulative effect is uncertainty and inconsistent 
          decisions about how much maintenance should be paid. In a great many 
          instances, the maintenance awarded is not paid or the payments fall 
          into arrears and take weeks to re-establish. Only 30 per cent of lone 
          mothers and 3 per cent of lone fathers receive regular maintenance for 
          their children. More than 750,000 lone parents depend on income 
          support. Many lone mothers want to go to work but do not feel able to 
          do so."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=31><A name=para31>&nbsp;&nbsp;The defects identified in this 
        paragraph were due in part to the fact that the assessment of the 
        amounts to be paid as maintenance for children by their parents was left 
        to the courts, leading to inconsistency; and in part to the fact that 
        the initiative lay with the parent in whose favour an order was made to 
        ensure that payments were kept up to date and that, where necessary, the 
        order was enforced, with the result that in many cases the amounts due 
        were not paid. Hitherto the approach had been to confer a right on the 
        parent with care to claim maintenance for the child and, if the sums 
        which the court ordered to be paid were not paid, to take proceedings in 
        her own name for their recovery. The system depended on the traditional 
        view that the solution to problems created by gaps in the common law was 
        to create new rights and obligations by statutory enactment. The 
        enforcement of these rights and obligations would then follow the 
        ordinary course, whereby it was up to the party whose rights were 
        infringed to take proceedings to enforce them. </A>

        <P></P>
        <LI value=32><A name=para32>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1991 Act departs entirely 
        from this approach. As Hale LJ said in <I>Huxley v Child Support 
        Officer</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/3015.html">[2000] 1 FLR 898</a>, 908, the child support system which was 
        introduced by this Act is fundamentally a nationalised system for 
        assessing and enforcing an obligation which each parent owes primarily 
        to the child. It replaces the powers of the courts to make orders for 
        periodical payments to be made for children. And it replaces the system 
        which left it to parents to apply for the enforcement of these orders 
        with a system that places the responsibility for enforcement on the 
        Secretary of State and through him on the agency. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=33><A name=para33>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act starts by asserting in 
        section 1(1) that, for its purposes, each parent of a qualifying child 
        is responsible for maintaining him. It describes the maintenance of any 
        qualifying child of his by an absent parent in section 1(2) as a 
        "responsibility". Section 1(2) states that the absent parent will have 
        met this responsibility by making such periodical payments of 
        maintenance as may be determined in accordance with the provisions of 
        the Act. The Act uses the word "duty" in section 1(3), where it refers 
        to the duty of the absent parent with respect to whom the assessment was 
        made to make the payments, and the word "obligation" in section 4(2)(b), 
        where it refers to the enforcement of the obligation to pay child 
        support maintenance in accordance with the assessment. But nowhere in 
        the Act is it said that the absent parent owes a duty, or is under an 
        obligation, to pay that amount to the person with care. Nor is it said 
        anywhere that the person with care has a right which she can enforce 
        against the absent parent. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=34><A name=para34>&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the Act is that 
        the obligation to pay the maintenance assessment is owed in respect of 
        the qualifying child but that it is enforceable by the Secretary of 
        State. As Morritt LJ said in <I>Department of Social Security v 
        Butler</I> [1995] 1 WLR 1528, 1540, the Secretary of State claims in 
        respect of the statutory right which is correlative with the obligation 
        expressed in section 1(3). Both the person with care and the absent 
        parent are given the right by section 4(1) to apply to the Secretary of 
        State for the making of a maintenance assessment. Where an assessment is 
        made, they are both then given the right by section 4(2) to apply to the 
        Secretary of State to arrange for its collection and enforcement. But 
        enforcement is not something which they can demand. Section 4(2) makes 
        it clear that enforcement of the obligation to pay child support 
        maintenance is at the discretion of the Secretary of State, not at the 
        discretion of the person who applies for its enforcement. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=35><A name=para35>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would conclude that the 1991 
        Act has deliberately avoided conferring a right on the person with care 
        to enforce a child maintenance assessment against the absent parent. 
        Enforcement is exclusively a matter for the Secretary of State. It 
        follows that the person with care has no right to apply to a court for 
        the enforcement of the assessment. A child who has attained the age of 
        12 years and is habitually resident in Scotland is given the right to 
        apply to the Secretary of State for a maintenance assessment by section 
        7(1). But here too the enforcement of any assessment is a matter for the 
        Secretary of State, not for the child. The system has been designed on 
        the assumption that a system of child support maintenance which is run 
        by the state will operate more efficiently than one that relies on 
        private enterprise. Experience has shown that its operation in practice 
        has fallen far short of what was expected of it. But that is the system 
        that Parliament has laid down, and we must take it as we find it. It 
        does not permit a person with care to intervene in proceedings for its 
        enforcement which are not being conducted as efficiently or as 
        effectively as she would like. This is a consequence of the fact that 
        she has no right against the absent parent which she can enforce in any 
        court. It is a matter of substantive law, not of procedure. </A>

        <LI value=36><A name=para36>&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 6(1) of the Convention 
        provides that in the determination of "his civil rights and obligations" 
        everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial 
        tribunal established by law. This provision must be read in the light of 
        the rule of law referred to in the preamble to the Convention, of which 
        the principle whereby a civil claim must be capable of being submitted 
        to a judge is an integral part. In <I>Golder v United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1975/1.html">(1975) 1 EHRR 524</a>, 535-536, paras 35-36, the European Court said that this 
        principle ranks as one of the universally recognised fundamental 
        principles of law and that the right of access constitutes an element 
        which is inherent in the right stated in article 6(1). In <I>Ashingdane

        that limitations applied by the state on the right of access must not 
        restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to 
        such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. But in 
        order to invoke this principle one must first be able to say that the

        <BLOCKQUOTE>"The Commission  recalls that the concept of 'civil 
          rights' is autonomous. Thus, irrespective of whether a right is in 
          domestic law labelled 'public', 'private', 'civil' or something else, 
          it is ultimately for the Convention organs to decide whether it is a 
          'civil' right within the meaning of article 6(1). However, in the 
          Commission's view, article 6(1) does not impose requirements in 
          respect of the nature and scope of the relevant national law governing 
          the 'right' in question. Nor does the Commission consider that it is, 
          in principle, competent to determine or review the substantive content 
          of the civil law which ought to obtain in the State Party any more 
          than it could in respect of substantive criminal law. As it has stated 
          in App No 7151/75: <I>Sporrong and Lnnroth v Sweden</I>, series 
        B:</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>Whether a right is at all at issue in a particular case 
          depends primarily on the legal system of the State concerned. It is 
          true that the concept of a 'right' is itself autonomous to some 
          degree. Thus it is not decisive for the purposes of article 6(1) that 
          a given privilege or interest which exists in the domestic system is 
          not classified or described as a 'right' by that system. However, it 
          is clear that the Convention organs could not create by way of 
          interpretation of article 6(1) a substantive right which has no legal 
          basis whatsoever in the State concerned."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=38><A name=para38>&nbsp;&nbsp;As this passage indicates, each 
        of the two words in the phrase "civil right" has a part to play in the 
        assessment as to whether the guarantee in article 6(1) is engaged. The 
        exercise may be broken down into stages in this way. First it must be 
        demonstrated that the applicant is seeking access to a court to enforce 
        what the European Court will accept, according to the autonomous meaning 
        which it gives to this word, is a "right". It must then be demonstrated 
        that this is a right which the European Court will classify, again 
        according to the autonomous meaning that it gives to it, as a "civil" 
        right. Then there is the question whether the "civil right", if it is 
        subject to some degree of limitation by the national law, is restricted 
        or reduced to such a degree or to such an extent that the very essence 
        of the right is impaired. This is because, while the right of access to 
        a court is not the subject of an absolute guarantee in article 6(1), the 
        rule of law must be maintained and the individual must be protected 
        against the exercise of arbitrary power by the executive. If it is so 
        restricted or reduced, the Convention right will have been breached.

        it did not consider it necessary to settle that dispute as it had come

        explained in his speech in <I>Matthews</I>, paras 29-38 how that issue 
        should be approached. In these paragraphs he makes the point that the 
        purpose for which this distinction exists is to prevent contracting 
        states from imposing restrictions on the right to bring one's dispute 
        before the judicial branch of government in a way that threatens the 
        rule of law and the separation of powers: see para 35. In the present 
        case, however, the issue is much more clear cut. It is whether Mrs Kehoe 
        was given a right of any kind by the 1991 Act which could be classified 
        as a "right" within the meaning of article 6(1). </A>

        <P></P>
        <LI value=41><A name=para41>&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this case lies in the 
        point of principle that was identified by the Commission in <I>Pinder v 
        United Kingdom</I> (1984) 7 EHRR 464, 465, para 5. This is that, while 
        the concept of a "right" is autonomous to some degree because it does 
        not depend on how the privilege or interest concerned is classified in 
        the domestic system, it is not open to the European Court when it is 
        applying article 6(1) to create a substantive right which has no legal 
        basis in that system at all. Article 6(1), on its own terms, has nothing 
        to say about the content of the individual's civil rights. Nor does it 
        impose an obligation on the state party to confer any particular rights 
        in substantive law on the individual. As the European Court said in 
        <I>James v United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 123</a>, 157-158, para 81: </A>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>"Article 6(1) extends only to 'contestations' (disputes) 
          over (civil) 'rights and obligations' which can be said, at least on 
          arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law: it does not in 
          itself guarantee any particular content for (civil) 'rights and 
          obligations' in the substantive law of the Contracting 
        States."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>In <I>Z v United Kingdom</I> (2001) 34 EHRR 97, 134, para 87 the 
        Court quoted these words which I have taken from its decision in 
        <I>James v United Kingdom</I>, which it said was part of "its constant 
        case law". At p 137, para 98 the Court said:</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"As it has recalled above in paragraph 87 it is a 
          principle of Convention case law that article 6 does not in itself 
          guarantee any particular content for civil rights and obligations in 
          national law, although other articles such as those protecting the 
          right to respect for family life and the right to property may do so. 
          It is not enough to bring article 6(1) into play that the 
          non-existence of a cause of action in domestic law may be described as 
          having the same effect as an immunity, in the sense of not enabling 
          the applicant to sue for a given category of harm."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=42><A name=para42>&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence of the passage 
        that I have quoted from <I>Z v United Kingdom</I> can, I think, be 
        applied directly to the present case. It is not enough to bring article 
        6(1) into play to assert that, as the whole object of the scheme is that 
        the person with care is the person who will ultimately benefit from the 
        enforcement process, Mrs Kehoe should be allowed at least some say in 
        how that process is conducted. I respectfully agree with Latham LJ that 
        it seems unsatisfactory that she should not have that right, as the 
        agency's priorities are inevitably different from those of the person 
        with care of the child, who may disagree profoundly with the agency as 
        to how the proceedings in which she has such an obvious interest should 
        be conducted: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/225.html">[2004] QB 1378</a>, 1414, para 102. But the fact is that the 
        1991 Act itself, which is the only source from which it could be 
        derived, does not give her that right. The scheme of the 1991 Act is not 
        designed to allow the person with care to play any part in the 
        enforcement process at all. It is not possible to envisage how that 
        might be done without re-writing the scheme which the Act has laid down. 
        In my opinion this is not even a case where it can be said that the 
        existence of a right to participate in this process is arguable. </A>

        <LI value=43><A name=para43>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hold that Mrs Kehoe's 
        argument that the system which prevents her from playing any part in the 
        enforcement process is incompatible with article 6(1) fails at the first 
        stage. This is because she has no substantive right to do this in 
        domestic law which is capable in Convention law of engaging the 
        guarantees that are afforded with regard to "civil rights and 
        obligations" by that article. I appreciate the force of her complaint 
        that the agency has failed to take action within a reasonable time to 
        enforce the assessments. But, as article 6(1) is not engaged, the 
        conclusion must be that the agency cannot be said to have acted 
        unlawfully within the meaning of section 7(1) of the Human Rights Act 
        1998. The result is that that Act cannot provide her with a remedy. I 
        would dismiss the appeal. </A>

        <P>My Lords,</P>
        <LI value=44><A name=para44>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the great advantage 
        of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord 
        Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead. I am in full agreement 
        with their opinions. The Child Support Act 1991 as amended did not give 
        Mrs Kehoe any right to participate directly in the process of enforcing 
        a child support maintenance assessment against Mr Kehoe, in the sense of 
        her being able to bring proceedings in her own name against him. That 
        is, in the circumstances of her case, prohibited by section 8 of the 
        1991 Act. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=45><A name=para45>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only add that I would 
        not accept (and I do not understand my Lords to be expressing the view) 
        that Mrs Kehoe has no enforceable rights whatever in respect of the 
        enforcement process. If the Child Support Agency were to refuse to 
        enforce a claim because it made some error of law (such as 
        misunderstanding the extent of its statutory powers) Mrs Kehoe could 
        take proceedings by way of judicial review, and in that way she could 
        hope to influence the enforcement process. She would plainly have a 
        sufficient interest to bring such proceedings. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=46><A name=para46>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether she would (in any such 
        judicial review proceedings) be securing the determination of a civil 
        right is, I think, open to debate. She would be acting to obtain through 
        a social welfare agency a pecuniary benefit in which she had a direct 
        personal interest, but in the enforcement of which the agency had a 
        measure of discretion. The trend of the Strasbourg jurisprudence is 
        towards an ever-widening interpretation of "civil rights": see <I>Runa 
        Begum v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council</I> <A

        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=47><A name=para47>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, I think, parallels 
        with private law relationships in which an individual may have interests 
        which would generally be regarded as important legal rights, but which 
        are not normally enforceable by direct action. A shareholder has an 
        interest in seeing that his company's assets are not misappropriated, 
        and a member of an occupational pension scheme has a similar interest in 
        respect of assets in the pension fund. Well-settled principles of 
        company law and trust law (to which there are also well-settled 
        exceptions) require him to call on the company or the trustees to 
        enforce rights of action which are vested, not in him, but in the 
        company or the trustees. If they fail to act the shareholder or 
        beneficiary may have to embark on domestic proceedings as an indirect 
        means of trying to enforce his interest. The absence (as a normal rule) 
        of a direct right of action is not a deprivation of his Article 6 (1) 
        rights, but is a reflection of substantive principles which are part of 
        the content of British company law or English trust law. Mrs Kehoe's 
        position under the 1991 Act is essentially the same. </A>

        <P>My Lords,</P>
        <LI value=49><A name=para49>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another case which has 
        been presented to us largely as a case about adults' rights when in 
        reality it is a case about children's rights. It concerns the obligation 
        to maintain one's children and the corresponding right of those children 
        to obtain the benefit of that obligation. The issue is whether the 
        restrictions placed on direct access to the courts to enforce that 
        obligation by section 8(1) and (3) of the Child Support Act 1991 are 
        compatible with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
        Article 6 is concerned only with the fair and impartial adjudication and 
        enforcement of the rights recognised in domestic law. It does not 
        guarantee any particular content to those rights. Put another way, the 
        issue is whether the 1991 Act has defined the extent of that obligation 
        and that right or whether it has merely altered the machinery for 
        assessing and enforcing them. If it is the latter, then the underlying 
        right still exists and the Act's provisions may be regarded as 
        procedural only. If it is the former, then all that survive are the 
        rights set out in the Act itself. In my view, it is not possible to 
        answer that question by looking only at the rights contained in the 1991 
        Act itself. They have to be set in the context of the scope of the 
        parents' obligations and the children's rights as a whole. The Child 
        Support Act is only one of a number of ways in which the law recognises 
        these. </A>

        <P></P>
        <LI value=50><A name=para50>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to think of 
        anything more important for the present and future good of society than 
        that our children should be properly cared for and brought up. We who 
        are nearing the end of our productive lives will depend more than most 
        upon the health, strength and productivity of the following generations. 
        The human infant has a long period of dependency in any event. But we 
        have added to that by our requirements that they be educated up to the 
        age of 16 and disabled from earning their own living until then. Someone 
        must therefore provide for them. Blackstone (<I>Commentaries</I>, book 
        1, chapter XVI) regarded this as a matter of natural law: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"The duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of 
          their children, is a principle of natural law; an obligation laid on 
          them not only by nature herself, but by their own proper act, in 
          bringing them into the world: for they would be in the highest manner 
          injurious to their issue, if they only gave their children life, that 
          they might afterwards see them perish, By begetting them, therefore, 
          they have entered into a voluntary obligation, to endeavour, so far as 
          in them lies, that the life which they have bestowed shall be 
          supported and preserved. And thus the children will have a perfect 
          <I>right</I> of receiving maintenance from their parents."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to say that: </P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is a principle of law, that there is an obligation on 
          every man to provide for those descended from his loins; and the 
          manner in which this obligation shall be performed, is pointed out 
          ..." </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so even for children born out of 
        wedlock:</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"Let us next see the duty of parents to their bastard 
          children by our law, which is principally that of maintenance. For, 
          though bastards are not looked upon as children to any civil purposes, 
          yet the ties of nature, of which maintenance is one, are not so easily 
          dissolved;.." </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=51><A name=para51>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our law has always recognised 
        the right of a child who is too young to fend for herself to be provided 
        for by her parents. The problem has always been to find an effective 
        method of enforcement. The child was too young to do so and the married 
        mother had no separate right to sue her husband. Hence the machinery of 
        enforcement was laid down in the Poor Laws. As Lindley LJ put it in 
        <I>Thomasset v Thomasset</I> [1894] P 295, at p 299, "As regards 
        maintenance, the parents' obligations were measured both at law and in 
        equity by the Poor Laws". </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=52><A name=para52>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact that the father's 
        obligations were measured by the Poor Laws did not mean that the courts 
        of law and equity would ignore them. The principles underlying the later 
        statutory concept of 'wilful neglect to maintain' a wife or child, even 
        the later liability to reimburse the public purse for benefits expended, 
        were those developed by the common law. Hence, just as the husband's 
        common law duty to maintain his wife would normally be discharged by 
        providing the home which they shared, the father's duty to maintain his 
        children would be discharged by providing them with a home: see eg 
        <I>McGowan v McGowan </I>[1948] 2 All ER 1032, per Lord Hodson at 1034. 
        </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=53><A name=para53>&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law courts would not 
        intrude into the matrimonial relationship, or trespass upon the 
        jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts over that relationship, by 
        ordering the husband to make payments to his wife. But a wife who was 
        living with her husband did have the apparent authority to contract as 
        his agent for the expenses of the household. And if they were living 
        apart, the common law recognised her agency of necessity, the right to 
        pledge her husband's credit for necessaries according to her station in 
        life. Unlike the housekeeping authority, this could not be countermanded 
        by the husband. But the agency of necessity subsisted only if the wife 
        was justified in living apart from her husband. Hence she would lose it 
        for ever if she was guilty of adultery, no matter how badly her husband 
        had behaved: see <I>Govier v Hancock</I> (1796) 6 Term Rep 603; it would 
        be suspended while she was in desertion: see <I>Jones v Newtown and 
        Llanidloes Guardians </I>[1920] 3 KB 381; but if they were obliged to 
        live apart through no fault of hers, for example because of illness, the 
        obligation continued: see <I>Lilley v Lilley</I> [1960] P 169. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=54><A name=para54>&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while there seems to have 
        been a view that a child might have a similar agency of necessity to 
        enforce the father's duty to maintain him, the moral obligation being if 
        anything stronger than that towards a wife: see <I>Urmston v 
        Newcomen</I> (1836) 4 Ad &amp; El 899. It was eventually firmly 
        established in <I>Mortimore v Wright</I> (1840) 6 M &amp; W 482 that a 
        father was not liable for his son's debts, even for necessaries, unless 
        the father had agreed to this, whether expressly or by implication; see 
        also <I>Shelton v Springlett</I> (1851) 11 CB 452. But these were cases 
        of near-adult sons who might be expected to fend for themselves. On the 
        other hand, it was recognised that if a father placed his young children 
        in the care of a servant or nurse, he might be liable for necessaries 
        supplied by her or at her request: see <I>Hesketh v Gowing</I> (1804) 5 
        Esp 131; <I>Cooper v Phillips</I> (1831) 4 C &amp; P 581. But these may 
        have been cases of implied authority rather than agency of necessity. 
        However, once it became possible for the wife to obtain custody of a 
        child even against the father's will, the law recognised that her agency 
        of necessity extended to necessaries for a child in her custody as well 
        as for herself: see <I>Bazeley v Forder</I> (1868) LR 3 QB 559. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=55><A name=para55>&nbsp;&nbsp;A further recognition by the 
        common law of a duty to maintain was the opinion of the judges that it 
        was an indictable misdemeanour at common law for a person under a duty 
        to provide for an infant of tender years to neglect to do so and thereby 
        injure his health: see <I>R v Friend</I> (1802) Russ &amp; Ry 20. A 
        comprehensive offence of ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning or 
        exposing a child was enacted in the Prevention of Cruelty to, and 
        Protection of Children Act 1889, the forerunner of the present offence 
        of child cruelty under section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 
        1933. A parent or person 'legally liable to maintain' a child is deemed 
        to have neglected him for this purpose if he has failed to provide 
        adequate food, clothing, medical aid or lodging, even if he is not 
        living with the child. Until the Family Law Reform Act 1987, the 
        expression 'parent' did not include the father of an illegitimate child; 
        but the expression 'legally liable to maintain' did include a putative 
        father if he had been adjudged to be such. </A>

        <LI value=56><A name=para56>&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory recognition of the 
        parental duty to maintain dates back to the Elizabethan poor laws, 
        culminating in the Poor Relief Act of 1601, 43 Elizabeth c 2, s 7 of 
        which provided that </A>
        <P></P>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>" . . . the father and grandfather, and the mother and

          of a sufficient ability, shall, at their own charges, relieve and 
          maintain every such poor person in that manner, and according to that 
          rate, as by the justices of peace of that county where such sufficient 
          persons dwell, or the greater number of them, at their general quarter 
          sessions shall be assessed; upon pain that every one of them shall 
          forfeit 20s for every month which they shall fail therein."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The practice was to order, not only payment for the future, but also 
        repayment of money already spent by the overseers of the poor: see 
        Neville Brown, "National Assistance and the Liability to Maintain One's 
        Family" (1955) 18 MLR 110, at p 113. Thus the principle of family 
        responsibility or solidarity was laid down. The Poor Relief (Deserted 
        Wives and Children) Act 1718, 5 Geo I, c 7, allowed warrants for the 
        seizure of deserting husband's property in order to recoup relief given 
        to his wife and children. The procedure for obliging the putative father 
        of a child born out of wedlock to maintain the child was rather 
        different, but according to Professor Brown, more commonly used. For if 
        the children of married parents were poor, their parents would also be 
        poor; but it by no means followed that if an unmarried mother was poor, 
        the father would also be poor.</P>
        <LI value=57><A name=para57>&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Poor Law Act of 1834 
        made it a great deal more difficult to recover the cost of poor relief 
        from the father of a child born outside wedlock. It repealed the laws 
        allowing the mother or Overseers of the Poor to charge or affiliate a 
        man as the father, and substituted a procedure whereby the Overseers 
        could seek an order from the Quarter Sessions for reimbursement. But, 
        far from reducing the problem of illegitimacy (by deterring the 
        mothers), as the Poor Law Commissioners had hoped, this seems to have 
        increased it (by failing to deter the fathers). At all events, it led to 
        the Poor Law Amendment Act 1844. This gave the unmarried mother the 
        right to apply for an order for maintenance from the putative father, in 
        what later became affiliation proceedings. These remained essentially 
        unchanged until the Family Law Reform Act 1987 removed most of the legal 
        distinctions between the children of married and unmarried parents. They 
        were, however, the first in the modern line of statutes giving one 
        parent the right to claim an order for periodical payments against the 
        other. </A>

        <LI value=58><A name=para58>&nbsp;&nbsp;The married mother had to wait 
        until the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 transferred the matrimonial 
        jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to grant decrees of nullity or 
        divorce <I>a mensa et thoro,</I> now called judicial separation, to a 
        new Court for Matrimonial Causes. It also gave that court the power to 
        grant a divorce. Pending and on making those decrees, the court could 
        also make orders for the custody, maintenance and education of the 
        children (s 35). This power was later made available after the final 
        decree (Matrimonial Causes Act 1859, s 4) and then to decrees for 
        restitution of conjugal rights (Matrimonial Causes Act 1884, s 6). The 
        great majority of married mothers, who could not afford to go to the new 
        court, had to wait until the Matrimonial Causes Act 1878 first gave them 
        the right to apply (in very limited circumstances) to a magistrates' 
        court for a separation and maintenance order and for custody of children 
        up to the age of 10. The grounds for making such orders were soon 
        extended, first by the Married Women (Maintenance in Case of Desertion) 
        Act 1886 and then by the Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act 1895, 
        to include, among other things, wilful neglect to provide reasonable 
        maintenance for her or her infant children whom her husband was 'legally 
        liable to maintain' (1895 Act, s 4). A separate power to award limited 
        weekly maintenance for a child in her custody was given by the Married 
        Women (Maintenance) Act 1920, s 1. Meanwhile, a succession of 19th 
        century Acts gave the mother the independent right to apply for the 
        custody of the children, and the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925, s 
        3(2), gave the court power to order the father to make weekly payments 
        (originally up to 10 shillings a week) for a child in her custody. </A>

        <LI value=59><A name=para59>&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the origins of the 
        four private law systems under which one parent might be ordered to make 
        payments to or for the benefit of a child being looked after by another: 
        (i) as an ancillary to matrimonial causes, which until 1967 were always 
        in the High Court; (ii) in matrimonial proceedings in magistrates' 
        courts; (iii) in Guardianship of Minors Act proceedings in the High 
        Court, county courts or magistrates' courts; and (iv) in affiliation 
        proceedings in magistrates' courts, which were until 1987 the only means 
        of obtaining support from the father of an illegitimate child. The 
        Family Law Reform Act 1987 removed the discrimination between legitimate 
        and illegitimate children by expanding the powers under the Guardianship 
        of Minors Acts to include the capital provision which is available for 
        the children of married parents in matrimonial causes and making them 
        available to both. The Guardianship of Minors Act powers were replaced 
        by Schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989; but this left intact the powers 
        in matrimonial causes and matrimonial proceedings so as to avoid having 
        to consider financial provision for the child separately from provision 
        for the adults. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=60><A name=para60>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a separate system, 
        descended from the Poor Law, for recovering the costs of public 
        assistance from 'liable relatives'. We have already seen the extent of 
        the family obligations between parents, grandparents and children which 
        dates back to the Elizabethan poor law. Obligations towards wives, and 
        then husbands, came later. The position which had been reached by 1927 
        was consolidated in section 41 of the Poor Law Act of that year, which 
        was repeated in section 14 of the Poor Law Act 1930. The power of the 
        poor law authorities to recoup from liable relatives was widely used 
        until the outbreak of World War I. According to Sir Morris Finer and 
        Professor O R McGregor in their invaluable 'The History of the 
        Obligation to Maintain' (published as Appendix 5 to the Report of the 
        Committee on One-Parent Families, chaired by Sir Morris Finer, 1974, 
        Cmnd 5629), </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>'. . . the poor law authorities were much better placed to 
          arraign liable relatives and to enforce claims for reimbursement of 
          poor relief against them. But even their success was illusory because 
          . . . the result in no less than half the cases before 1914 was not 
          reimbursement but the imprisonment of the liable relative.'</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=61><A name=para61>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poor Law was abolished by 
        the National Assistance Act 1948. In the post war welfare state, it was 
        expected that most areas of need would be covered by national insurance 
        benefits and that means-tested benefits would be a safety net for the 
        few who were not covered by the national insurance scheme. The 1948 Act 
        retained the possibility of recovery from a 'liable relative' but 
        reduced those liable: under section 42, a man was liable to maintain his 
        wife and children, including illegitimate children of whom he had been 
        adjudged putative father, and a woman was liable to maintain her husband 
        and children. Neither was liable to maintain a <I>former</I> spouse. 
</A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=62><A name=para62>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also intended that the 
        receipt of national assistance, later to become supplementary benefit, 
        and later still income support, should not carry a stigma. As Dr Stephen 
        Cretney relates, in his masterly history, <I>Family Law in the Twentieth 
        Century, A History</I>, 2003, at p 460, in keeping with this new 
        entitlement-based approach the benefit authorities changed their policy 
        about seeking recovery from liable relatives. Instead of routinely 
        seeking this, they would try to reach agreement with the husband or 
        father, and accept any offer which they considered reasonable. Rather 
        than take proceedings themselves, they would encourage the mother to do 
        so. The disadvantage for the mother was that she would then not know 
        from week to week how much benefit she would get, because it all 
        depended upon how much maintenance the husband or father had paid that 
        week. The sensible solution eventually found was that she would assign 
        or 'divert' any payment made into the magistrates' court to the benefit 
        authorities. They could then issue her with an order book which she 
        could safely cash each week. Although the benefit authorities retained 
        their power to seek recovery from the liable relative, in practice this 
        was rarely done even in cases where the wife or mother had, for whatever 
        reason, chosen not to bring proceedings. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=63><A name=para63>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was scarcely surprising that 
        the courts would have this changed climate in mind when deciding what 
        orders for financial provision should be made. They were not supposed to 
        take means-tested benefits into account as a resource available to the 
        wife and mother, but neither were they supposed to order a sum which 
        would reduce the husband and father's income below that which he would 
        receive for himself and his new family were he also on benefit: see 
        <I>Barnes v Barnes</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1972/2.html">[1972] 1 WLR 1381</a>. Furthermore, there has never 
        been a legal liability to support a <I>former</I> spouse, and divorce 
        was becoming more and more readily available, so that fewer and fewer 
        separated spouses would remain married and thus liable to support one 
        another. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=64><A name=para64>&nbsp;&nbsp;It became common for divorcing 
        parties to agree a 'clean break', in which the wife and children would 
        retain the family home, where the mortgage interest would be met by the 
        benefit authorities, while the husband was relieved of any further 
        maintenance liabilities. This approach may even have been accelerated by 
        the encouragement given to a clean break and the ending of private 
        maintenance for divorced wives by the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings 
        Act 1984. The fact that there were still both private and public law 
        liabilities to maintain the children receded into the background, 
        especially as the risk that the benefit authorities would proceed 
        against the absent parent were so slim. This trend culminated in 
        <I>Delaney v Delaney</I> [1991] 2 FLR 457, where the court proclaimed 
        that 'among the realities of life is that there is a life after 
        divorce'. If, having regard to reasonable financial commitments 
        undertaken by the husband, there was insufficient left properly to 
        maintain the wife and children, the court could have regard to the 
        social security benefits available to them and avoid making an order 
        which would be 'financially crippling' to the husband. So an order that 
        he should pay 10 per week in respect of each of his three children was 
        reduced to an order for 50 pence each per year. </A>

        <BLOCKQUOTE><I>The Child Support Act 1991</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>To sum up, until the 
        passing of the Child Support Act 1991, the position was as stated by 
        Professor Peter Bromley in his leading textbook on <I>Family Law 
        </I>(8th ed, 1992, p 651): "At common law a father is under a duty to 
        maintain only his legitimate minor children and to provide them with 
        food, clothing, lodging and other necessities." Save for its limited 
        enforcement through other people, however, this duty was always 
        unenforceable in the courts. But it was reinforced and expanded by two 
        kinds of statutory obligation: a private law obligation to make the 
        payments ordered by a court under the various statutes listed earlier; 
        and a public law obligation to reimburse the state for benefits paid for 
        the children.</P>
        <LI value=66><A name=para66>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality was, however, that 
        in the many separated families who were dependent in whole or in part 
        upon state benefits that obligation was not enforced. Indeed, in many 
        cases it was not translated into an order at all. For those who were not 
        dependent upon state benefits, however, it might remain an important 
        part of their finances after separation. Husbands were often happier to 
        pay maintenance for their children than for their former wives. 
        Nevertheless, it is not surprising that the Government complained, in 
        <I>Children Come First</I>, 1990, Cm 1263, vol II, para 1.4.5, that 'The 
        contribution made by maintenance to the income of lone parent families 
        therefore remains too low." </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=67><A name=para67>&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution chosen has three 
        essential features. First, instead of the quantum of basic child support 
        being left to the variable discretion of the courts, it is worked out 
        according to a fixed formula. The formula has been greatly simplified by 
        the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, but the 
        principle is still the same. Secondly, the task of assessing that 
        support, tracing absent parents and collecting it from them, whether 
        voluntarily or compulsorily, was transferred from the courts to the new 
        Child Support Agency, the successor to the old 'liable relative' branch 
        of the Department of Social Security. Thirdly, the courts were 
        prohibited from making periodical payment orders for the benefit of the 
        child in any case where a child support officer would have jurisdiction 
        to make a maintenance assessment: see the 1991 Act, s 8(1) and (3). </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=68><A name=para68>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note, 
        however, that neither the private nor the public law obligation, nor the 
        corresponding right of the child to the benefit of that obligation, has 
        been taken away. The public law liabilities, carried over from the old 
        Poor Law, are defined by section 78(6) of the Social Security 
        Administration Act 1992: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a man shall be liable to maintain his wife 
          and any children of whom he is the father;</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;a woman shall be liable to maintain her 
          husband and any children of whom she is the mother."</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>It is still an offence persistently to refuse or neglect to perform 
        that obligation, as a result of which income-based benefits are paid in 
        respect of a spouse or child: see s 105(1). And the Secretary of State 
        may still apply for an order against such a liable person: see s 
        106(1).</P>
        <LI value=69><A name=para69>&nbsp;&nbsp;The private law liabilities have 
        also been retained in the new scheme. Unlike the father's common law 
        guardianship of his legitimate children, his common law obligation to 
        maintain them has never been abolished, although the wife's agency of 
        necessity was abolished in 1970. Furthermore, the courts' powers to make 
        the full range of orders for the benefit of children remain on the 
        statute book. Despite the general prohibition in section 8(1) and (3) of 
        the 1991 Act, already referred to, the courts remain able to give effect 
        to the parental obligation in a number of ways: </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;by making 'top up' orders for periodical 
          payments where the income of the non-resident parent is above a 
          threshold where it may be appropriate for him to pay more than is 
          payable under the formula (s 8(6)); </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;by making 'school fees orders' for 
          children who are being educated privately (s 8(7)); </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;by making orders to cover expenses 
          attributable to the child's disability (s 8(8)); </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;by making lump sum and property adjustment 
          orders for the benefit of children under the Matrimonial Causes Act 
          1973 or the Children Act 1989. Although these are mainly used to make 
          provision for housing or other capital expenditure rather than as a 
          substitute for periodical maintenance, it has been held that they may 
          be used for maintenance purposes if the child support machinery has 
          not been invoked: see <I>V v V (Child Maintenance)</I> [2001] 2 FLR 
          799; </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;by making and varying consent orders which 
          embody periodical payments for a child (s 8(5) to (11); Child 
          Maintenance (Written Agreements) Order 1993). Unless the parent with 
          care receives relevant social security payments, this precludes any 
          further application for a child support assessment. Thus parents can, 
          in effect, avoid the intervention of the Child Support Agency by 
          agreeing a nominal sum in periodical payments at the outset and then 
          returning to court for it to be varied: see again <I>V v V</I>; 
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;by making an order for spousal maintenance 
          which includes the costs of supporting the children and will be 
          reduced <I>pro tanto</I> if and when a maintenance assessment under 
          the 1991 Act is made (a so-called 'Segal order' named after the judge 
          who invented it); </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;by enforcing a maintenance agreement made 
          between the parents for the benefit of their children, although such 
          an agreement cannot prevent a person making an application to the 
          Agency for a maintenance assessment, nor does the court have 
          jurisdiction to vary it if the Agency would have jurisdiction to make 
          an assessment (s 9(3), (4) and (5)). </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <LI value=70><A name=para70>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, therefore, that 
        the obligation of a parent to maintain his children, and the right of 
        those children to have the benefit of that obligation, is not wholly 
        contained in the 1991 Act. Far from it. The Act left all the previous 
        law intact, merely precluding the courts from using their powers in 
        cases where the Agency was supposed to do it for them. The situation 
        could not be more different from cases such as <I>Matthews v Ministry of 
        Defence</I> <A 
        href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/4.html">[2003] 1 AC 1163</a></A>, where Parliament clearly did <I>not</I> intend that the 
        servicemen should be able to seek compensation in tort; instead they 
        were to be limited to their service pension rights. The Child Support 
        Act 1991 contemplates that, as a minimum, children should have the 
        benefit of the maintenance obligation as defined under the formula; but 
        it does not contemplate that children should be limited to their rights 
        under that Act; in appropriate circumstances, they may be supplemented 
        or replaced in all the ways recounted earlier. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=71><A name=para71>&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, it is clear 
        to me that children have a civil right to be maintained by their parents 
        which is such as to engage article 6 of the European Convention on Human 
        Rights. Their rights are not limited to the rights given to the parent 
        with care under the Child Support Act. The provisions of that Act are 
        simply a means of quantifying and enforcing part of their rights. I 
        appreciate that the line between a procedural and a substantive bar is 
        not always easy to draw: see <I>Matthews</I> at para 3. A distinction 
        can readily be drawn between that part of the child support scheme which 
        lays down the formula and machinery for assessing the extent of the 
        basic obligation and that part of the scheme which provides for its 
        enforcement. The formula is a substantive definition of the extent of 
        the basic right. But in my view the continued existence of the wider 
        rights, together with the fundamental objective of the 1991 Act to 
        improve the provision made for children by their non-resident parents, 
        places the collection and enforcement provisions of the Act on the 
        procedural rather than the substantive side of the line. A civil right 
        to be maintained exists and <I>prima facie</I> children are entitled to 
        the benefit of the article 6 rights in the determination and enforcement 
        of that right. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=72><A name=para72>&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that this is 
        exactly what the system is trying to do. It is trying to enforce the 
        children's rights. It is sometimes, as this case shows, lamentably 
        inefficient in so doing. It is safe to assume that there are cases, of 
        which this may be one, where the children's carer would be much more 
        efficient in enforcing the children's rights. The children's carer has a 
        direct and personal interest in enforcement which the Agency, however 
        good its intentions, does not. Even in benefit cases, where the state 
        does have a direct interest in enforcement, it is not the sort of 
        interest which stems from needing enough money to feed, clothe and house 
        the children on a day to day basis. Only a parent who is worrying about 
        where the money is to be found for the school dinners, the school trips, 
        the school uniform, sports gear or musical instruments, or to visit the 
        'absent' parent, not only this week but the next and the next for many 
        years to come, has that sort of interest. A promise that the Agency is 
        doing its best is not enough. Nor is the threat or reality of judicial 
        review. Most people simply do not have access to the Administrative 
        Court in the way that they used to have access to their local 
        magistrates' court. Judicial review may produce some action from the 
        Agency, but what is needed is money from the absent parent. Action from 
        the Agency will not replace the money which has been irretrievably lost 
        as a result of its failure to act in time. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=73><A name=para73>&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, in my view the 
        correct analysis of the situation is this. The children's civil right to 
        the benefit of the parental obligation to maintain them survives the 
        Child Support Act. The extent of that obligation is defined by the Act 
        together with the remaining private law powers. But the Act operates, 
        not only as a limit to the extent of the obligation but also as a limit 
        to its enforcement. This is throughout a private civil right. Even in a 
        benefit case the money paid by the non-resident parent is the children's 
        money. All the Act does is take away the carer's right to enforce 
        payment. That places the enforcement provisions on the procedural side 
        of the line. The parallel with <I>Philis v Greece </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1991/38.html">(1991) 13 EHRR 741</a> 
        is very close. Article 6 is therefore engaged. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=74><A name=para74>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Act was designed to 
        improve the enforcement of the children's civil right. That must be a 
        legitimate aim. But was it a proportionate response to that legitimate 
        aim to remove the right of the parent with care to enforce the 
        substantive obligation directly? I do not find that an easy question to 
        answer. The comparative study prepared for this case by Professor 
        Wikeley shows that it is not a necessary feature of comparable child 
        support schemes elsewhere in the common law world. While the child 
        support scheme was under review in the late 1990s, there was 
        considerable debate about whether the courts should regain their power 
        to make the basic award on the application of the parent with care. The 
        formula would remain the same in all cases, but parents who were not 
        receiving means-tested benefits would be able to apply to the courts 
        rather than the Agency to award it. This was, however, rejected after 
        careful consideration by the Government (their final conclusions on the 
        role of the courts can be seen in <I>A new contract for welfare: 
        Children's rights and parents' responsibilities</I>, 1999, Cm 4349, 
        chapter 8). One can see why. The Government did not want to create 'one 
        law for the rich and one for the poor'. It would be difficult to apply 
        to the common case where the parent with care is sometimes in receipt of 
        relevant benefits and sometimes not. The families who can be sure that 
        they will never claim such benefits can still, with careful planning and 
        advice, make use of the courts' residual powers to avoid the Agency if 
        that is what they wish to do. Contrary to popular belief, there are many 
        separating parents who are not at loggerheads with one another and who 
        both want to do the best they can for their children. Sensible parents 
        who know that they will have to go on co-operating in bringing up their 
        children for some time to come may well prefer to make their own 
        arrangements. Others may prefer the arm's-length intervention of the 
        Agency, together with its enhanced collection and enforcement powers, to 
        the face to face confrontation in court. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=75><A name=para75>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the sort of policy 
        choice in a socio-economic field which the courts are usually prepared 
        to leave to the judgment of Parliament. Parliament, with the guidance of 
        Government, is better able to make the decision as to which scheme will 
        most effectively secure the recognition and enforcement of the 
        children's rights generally. It would be difficult to hold that the 
        scheme as a whole is incompatible with the children's rights to a speedy 
        determination and enforcement of their claims. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=76><A name=para76>&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I am right that the 
        children's civil rights to be properly maintained by their parents are 
        engaged, it follows that the public authority which is charged by 
        Parliament with securing the determination and enforcement of their 
        rights is under a duty to act compatibly with their article 6 right to 
        the speedy determination and effective enforcement of those rights. 
        Indeed, Mr Jay did not seek to argue that they were not. He accepted, 
        for the sake of the issue before the House, that if article 6 was 
        engaged in this case, the claim under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 
        1998 for failing to act in compliance with those rights should proceed. 
        It stands to reason that if the state is going to take over the 
        enforcement of a person's civil rights it has a duty to act compliantly 
        with article 6 in doing so. Just as the courts, as public authorities, 
        have to act compliantly with the Convention rights, so does the Agency. 
        The remedies, however, may be different if they do not. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=77><A name=para77>&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that I have reached 
        the same conclusion, albeit by a slightly different route, as Wall J in 
        the Administrative Court. This comes as no surprise. I would allow this 
        appeal and restore the order that he made. </A>

        <P><B>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</B></P>
        <P>My Lords,</P>
        <LI value=78><A name=para78>&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical question for your 
        Lordships' decision is whether Mrs Kehoe's (or indeed her children's) 
        article 6 rights were engaged whilst the Child Support Agency (CSA), 
        pursuant to the Child Support Act 1991 (the 1991 Act), were charged with 
        the enforcement of her ex-husband's assessed maintenance obligation. Did 
        she (or the children) have a civil right, akin to the engineer's 
        undoubted right to his fees in <I>Philis v Greece</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1991/38.html">(1991) 13 EHRR 741</a>, thwarted here as there by an enforcement scheme which denied to the 
        claimants themselves any direct access to the courts? In my judgment she 
        did not. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=79><A name=para79>&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now had the advantage of 
        reading in draft the opinions of all my noble and learned friends, I 
        find myself in agreement with the majority. The 1991 Act introduced, for 
        all those voluntarily or compulsorily seeking the CSA's help, an entire 
        scheme, substituting for whatever rights the parent with care (or, 
        indeed, qualifying children) might otherwise have had, the benefit of 
        the scheme itself (with, necessarily, any incidental dis-benefits). The 
        only right now enjoyed by those in Mrs Kehoe's position is to look to 
        the CSA for the proper discharge of its public law obligations under the 
        statute, a right which of course is itself sustainable under the courts' 
        supervisory jurisdiction. </A>
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI value=80><A name=para80>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I remain unpersuaded 
        that Mrs Kehoe (or her children) retained any right to maintenance 
        payments here such as to engage article 6 and thereby allow her to 
        complain of procedural failures on the part of the CSA in its attempt to 
        enforce payment by her ex-husband. I too would dismiss this appeal. </A>
