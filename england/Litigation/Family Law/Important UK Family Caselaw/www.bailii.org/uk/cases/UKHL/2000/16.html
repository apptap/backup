  <P>My Lords,</P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=3>Section 31(1) of the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A> 
  empowers the court to make an order placing a child in the care of a local 
  authority or putting him under the supervision of a local authority or a 
  probation officer. Before the court may make such an order certain minimum 
  conditions, familiarly known as threshold conditions, must be satisfied. These 
  are set out in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2), which reads: 
  <P>
  <UL>'A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is 
    satisfied- 
    <P></P></UL>
  <P>
  <UL>
    <UL>(a) that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, 
      significant harm; and 
      <P></P></UL></UL>
  <P>
  <UL>
    <UL>(b) that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to- 
      <P></P></UL></UL>
  <P>
  <UL>
    <UL>(i) the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the 
      order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a 
      parent to give him; or 
      <P></P></UL></UL>
  <P>
  <UL>
    <UL>(ii) the child's being beyond parental control.' 
      <P></P></UL></UL>
  <P>Harm is defined in wide terms in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(9). When the threshold conditions are satisfied, and the court proceeds 
  to consider whether to exercise its discretionary power to make a care order 
  or a supervision order, the child's welfare is the court's paramount 
  consideration. The court has regard in particular to the matters itemised on 
  the welfare checklist set out in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 
  1</A>(3) of <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the 
  Act</A>, including any harm the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering 
  and how capable each of his parents is of meeting his needs. Thus, the 
  findings made by the court regarding the threshold conditions are carried 
  forward to the consideration of the child's welfare needs. The court will not 
  make an order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child 
  than making no order (section 1(5)). </P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=4>On this appeal the House is called upon, for the third 
  time, to interpret the threshold conditions. In the previous case of <I>In</I> 
  <I>re M. (A Minor) (Care Orders: Threshold Conditions</I>) [1994] 2 A.C. 424 
  the House considered what was the date at which the threshold conditions must 
  be satisfied. In the case of <I>In re H. (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of 
  Proof)</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/16.html">[1996] AC 563</a> attention was focused on the first threshold 
  condition, sometimes referred to as the 'significant harm' condition, set out 
  in <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>a</I>). On the present occasion the point at issue concerns the 
  second threshold condition (the 'attributable' condition), set out in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>), and in particular the phrase 'the care given to the 
  child'. This appeal is another illustration of what Lord Templeman, in the 
  <I>re M.</I> case, aptly referred to as the tyranny of language. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=5>Before identifying the issue I should mention two 
  preliminary points which attracted little, if any, controversy between the 
  parties. First, the phrase 'attributable to' in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>) connotes a causal connection between the harm or 
  likelihood of harm on the one hand and the care or likely care or the child's 
  being beyond parental control on the other hand. Echoing the language of 
  Donaldson J. in a different context (in <I>Walsh v. Rother District Council 
  </I>[1978] I.C.R. 1216, 1220), the connection need not be that of a sole or 
  dominant or direct cause and effect; a contributory causal connection 
  suffices. For instance, if a parent entrusts a child to a third party without 
  taking the precautionary steps a reasonable parent would take to check the 
  suitability of the third party, and subsequently the third party injures or 
  sexually abuses the child, the harm suffered by the child may be regarded as 
  attributable to the inadequate care of the parent as well as the third party. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=6>The second preliminary point is that to be within <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>)(i) the care given or likely to be given must fall below an 
  objectively acceptable level. That level is the care a reasonable parent would 
  provide for the child concerned. Thus an absence of a reasonable standard of 
  parental care need not imply that the parents are at fault. It may be, for 
  instance, that for reasons beyond their control the parents are not able to 
  provide a reasonable standard of care for the child. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=7>The issue between the parties is best explained by 
  reference to the unhappy facts of this case. They are set out in the judgment 
  of the Court of Appeal, reported at [2000] 2 W.L.R. 346. The essential 
  features are these. Child 'A', a baby girl, was born on 30 March 1998. Her 
  parents were living together. A's mother returned to work three months later, 
  on 13 July, and for the next two months A was looked after by several people. 
  On 7 September 1998 a paid childminder, with a child of her own (child 'B', 
  born on 26 February 1998), took over responsibility for looking after A while 
  A's parents were at work. During the day A was looked after by B's mother in 
  her (B's mother's) home. Otherwise A's parents looked after A in their own 
  home. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=8>After this arrangement had been place for two months, on 
  2 November 1998 A was found to have sustained serious non-accidental head 
  injuries. She was then seven months old. The local authority applied for a 
  care order in respect of A, and subsequently in respect also of B. On 3 
  December A was discharged from hospital to foster carers. At a finding of fact 
  hearing which commenced in court on 1 March 1999 the local authority, in 
  respect of both A and B, sought to satisfy the threshold conditions by relying 
  exclusively on the injuries sustained by A between September and November 
  1998. The local authority did not seek to rely upon any other incident which 
  might have amounted to poor or deficient care by A's parents, nor did it 
  suggest that the choice of B's mother as child-minder constituted deficient 
  care on the part of A's parents. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=9>His Honour Judge Gee, sitting in the Blackburn County 
  Court, found that in the period of six weeks prior to 2 November A had 
  suffered at least two episodes of violent shaking, resulting in serious 
  non-accidental injuries. The injuries comprised subdural haemorrhages, retinal 
  haemorrhages and cerebral atrophy. They constituted significant harm for the 
  purpose of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>. The injuries had been inflicted by a member of household A or 
  household B, but not both. The father of B was not the perpetrator of any of 
  the injuries, but the evidence was such that it was not possible to decide 
  which of A's mother, A's father, or B's mother was the perpetrator. Judge Gee 
  expressed the dilemma confronting him in these stark terms: 
  <P>
  <UL>'If the criteria are met and orders are made I am exposing one child to 
    the possibility of removal from parents who are no risk and have done no 
    wrong. . . . If the applications are dismissed then I will undoubtedly be 
    causing one child to be returned to a parent or parents, one or both of whom 
    are an obvious and serious unassessed risk.' 
    <P></P></UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=10>The judge then applied to the facts of this case an 
  observation of Wall J. in <I>In re G (A Minor)(Care Order: Threshold 
  Conditions)</I> [1995] Fam. 16, 20: 
  <P>
  <UL>'The inescapable construction of <A 
    href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
    31</A>, in my judgment, is that the court has to be satisfied by evidence 
    that the significant harm suffered by the child is attributable to the care, 
    or absence of care, given to the child by the parent against whom the order 
    is sought.' (Emphasis added) 
    <P></P></UL>
  <P>Since he was unable to conclude that the harm suffered by A was 
  attributable to A's mother or father, Judge Gee dismissed the care order 
  application regarding A. As to B, this child had suffered no harm. Nor could B 
  be regarded as at risk of harm in the future because it had not been 
  established that B's mother had caused the injuries to A. The judge therefore 
  also dismissed the care order application regarding B. Judge Gee reached these 
  conclusions with evident reluctance. He said that the case called out for at 
  least a supervision order which would give the local authority, to an extent, 
  the right to keep an eye on the situation. He made an interim care order in 
  respect of both children pending the hearing of an appeal.</P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=11>The Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf M.R., Butler-Sloss and 
  Robert Walker L.JJ.) reversed the judge's decision regarding A and upheld his 
  decision regarding B. The court held that Judge Gee had interpreted the 
  language of the threshold conditions too narrowly. The 'attributable' 
  condition is satisfied if the harm is attributable to an absence of proper 
  care to the objective standard laid down in that condition. Giving the 
  judgment of the court, Robert Walker L.J. said (at [2000] 2 W.L.R. 346, 356): 
  <P>
  <UL>'With the rise in broken marriages and unmarried relationships, and the 
    economic pressure on mothers to remain in employment even while their 
    children are young, the task of caring for children is often shared between 
    parents who are living apart, grandparents and other relatives, and official 
    and unofficial childminders. Where the task is shared in that way and a 
    child suffers serious harm through lack of proper care, that child must not 
    be left at risk simply because it is not possible for the court to be sure 
    which part of the care network has failed.' 
    <P></P></UL>
  <P>The court added, regarding such a case, that 'apportionment of 
  responsibility as between the various carers is both imponderable and 
  irrelevant, even if they are alternate rather than joint carers.' Before the 
  House is an appeal by A's parents against this decision. The Court of Appeal's 
  decision regarding B is not the subject of an appeal to this House. 
  Accordingly, the correctness of the latter decision is not a matter before 
  your Lordships.</P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=12>I can now identify the issue of interpretation arising 
  on this appeal. In a case based on present harm ('is suffering . . . 
  significant harm') the attributable condition requires the court to be 
  satisfied that the harm is attributable to the care given to the child or, 
  which is not this case, to the child's being beyond parental control. That 
  nexus must be established on the basis of proved facts. But that prompts the 
  question: care by whom? The contention of A's parents is that, having regard 
  to the statutory context and the legislative policy behind Part IV of the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act</A>, 'the 
  care given to the child' in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>)(i) means the care given to the child by the parents or 
  other primary carers. The contrary contention, advanced by the local authority 
  and A's guardian, is that no such limiting words are to be read into the 
  statute: the relevant phrase means the care given by anyone who plays a part 
  in the care arrangements for the child. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=13>Stated more fully, the submission made by Mr. Harris 
  Q.C. on behalf of A's parents was that at the heart of the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act</A> is 
  the belief that the welfare and development of children are in general best 
  secured if they are brought up within the family by both parents playing a 
  full part in their upbringing. The same philosophy applies, correspondingly, 
  where substitute primary carers are bringing up a child in a settled home. The 
  state, acting through a local authority, should only be permitted to intervene 
  in the family life of the child by means of a care order if it can demonstrate 
  that intervention is necessary for the child's protection by reason of some 
  serious deficiency in care on the part of the parents or other primary carers, 
  as the case may be, and that no other course is appropriate. Counsel submitted 
  that a strictly literal interpretation of the phrase under consideration would 
  lead to an absurdity. Parliament cannot have intended that a child should be 
  at risk of being removed from his family, and the parents at risk of losing 
  their child, because of an unforeseeable failure of care by a third party to 
  whom the parents, wholly unexceptionably, had temporarily entrusted the child. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=14>Counsel further submitted that the statutory phrase is 
  ambiguous, and invited your Lordships' attention to observations made by Lord 
  Mackay of Clashfern L.C. in this House when promoting the Children Bill. Two 
  instances will suffice. On the second reading of the Bill Lord Mackay stated 
  (Hansard, 6 December 1988, col. 493): 
  <P>
  <UL>'. . . as a matter of principle it is important for the law in a free 
    society expressly to protect the integrity and independence of families save 
    where there is at least likelihood of significant harm to the child from 
    within the family.' 
    <P></P></UL>
  <P>At the committee stage Lord Mackay said (Hansard, 19 January 1989, cols. 
  349, 350):</P>
  <P>
  <UL>'I entirely agree that I have often said that where discretion is given 
    it is wise to make it as flexible as possible. However, I do not think that 
    that is an appropriate approach where the discretion will allow one of the 
    most serious possible interventions in family life. Therefore, I think it is 
    necessary to specify the grounds with reasonable particularity. That is what 
    we seek to do in this Bill . . . 
    <P></P></UL>
  <P>
  <UL>The purpose of this care order is to substitute the local authority for 
    the parent in the sense of the local authority having parental 
    responsibility for the child. That should only happen where something 
    concerning the parent has gone wrong. That appears to me to be essential.' 
    <P></P></UL></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=15>This is a forceful argument, up to a point. I accept 
  that the interpretation of the attributable condition urged on behalf of the 
  respondents and upheld by the Court of Appeal is too wide and loose. For this 
  one needs to look no further than Mr. Harris Q.C.'s example of the one-off 
  temporary entrustment of the child to a person reasonably believed by the 
  parents to be suitable. Injury inflicted by the temporary carer would satisfy 
  the threshold conditions. But the appellants' argument goes too far in the 
  other direction. The interpretation urged on behalf of the appellants is too 
  rigid. As with the respondents' submission, so also with the appellants' 
  submission: the conclusion to which it leads cannot be right. As the present 
  case exemplifies, the appellants' argument, if accepted, produces the result 
  that where a child has repeatedly sustained non-accidental injuries the court 
  may nevertheless be unable to intervene to protect the child by making a care 
  order or, even, a supervision order. In the present case the child is proved 
  to have sustained significant harm at the hands of one or both of her parents 
  or at the hands of a daytime carer. But, according to this argument, if the 
  court is unable to identify which of the child's carers was responsible for 
  inflicting the injuries, the child remains outside the threshold prescribed by 
  Parliament as the threshold which must be crossed before the court can proceed 
  to consider whether it is in the best interests of the child to make a care 
  order or supervision order. The child must, for the time being, remain 
  unprotected, since <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 31</A> 
  of the <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children 
  Act</A> and its associated emergency and interim provisions now provide the 
  only court mechanism available to a local authority to protect a child from 
  risk of further harm. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=16>I cannot believe Parliament intended that the 
  attributable condition in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>) should operate in this way. Such an interpretation would 
  mean that the child's future health, or even her life, would have to be 
  hazarded on the chance that, after all, the non-parental carer rather than one 
  of the parents inflicted the injuries. Self-evidently, to proceed in such a 
  way when a child is proved to have suffered serious injury on more than one 
  occasion could be dangerously irresponsible. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=17>There is a further factor which weighs with me. Sadly, 
  the unhappy facts of the present case are far from being exceptional. As the 
  Court of Appeal observed, the task of caring for children is often shared 
  nowadays between parents and others. When questions of non-accidental injury 
  or abuse arise, the court is frequently unable to discover precisely what 
  happened. This is not surprising. And yet, on the appellants' construction of 
  the attributable condition, in this common form situation of shared caring the 
  court is powerless to make even a supervision order if the judge is unable to 
  penetrate the fog of denials, evasions, lies and half-truths which all too 
  often descends in court at fact finding hearings. Indeed, in the present case 
  the judge observed, regarding the evidence of one witness, that it was 
  impossible to identify what was or might have been fact and what was or might 
  have been fiction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=18><A name=18>Against this background, I consider that a permissible 
  and preferable interpretation of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>)(i), between the two extremes, is as follows. The phrase 
  'care given to the child' refers primarily to the care given to the child by a 
  parent or parents or other primary carers. That is the norm. The matter stands 
  differently in a case such as the present one, where care is shared and the 
  court is unable to distinguish in a crucial respect between the care given by 
  the parents or primary carers and the care given by other carers. Different 
  considerations from the norm apply in a case of shared caring where the care 
  given by one or other of the carers is proved to have been deficient, with the 
  child suffering harm in consequence, but the court is unable to identify which 
  of the carers provided the deficient care. In such a case, the phrase 'care 
  given to the child' is apt to embrace not merely the care given by the parents 
  or other primary carers; it is apt to embrace the care given by any of the 
  carers. Some such meaning has to be given to the phrase if the unacceptable 
  consequences already mentioned are to be avoided. This interpretation achieves 
  that necessary result while, at the same time, encroaching to the minimum 
  extent on the general principles underpinning <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2). Parliament seems not to have foreseen this particular problem. The 
  courts must therefore apply the statutory language to the unforeseen situation 
  in the manner which best gives effect to the purposes the legislation was 
  enacted to achieve. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=19><A name=19>I recognise that the effect<I> </I>of this 
  construction is that the attributable condition may be satisfied when there is 
  no more than a possibility that the parents were responsible for inflicting 
  the injuries which the child has undoubtedly suffered. That is a consequence 
  which flows from giving the phrase, in the limited circumstances mentioned 
  above, the wider meaning those circumstances require. I appreciate also that 
  in such circumstances, when the court proceeds to the next stage and considers 
  whether to exercise its discretionary power to make a care order or 
  supervision order, the judge may be faced with a particularly difficult 
  problem. The judge will not know which individual was responsible for 
  inflicting the injuries. The child may suffer harm if left in a situation of 
  risk with his parents. The child may also suffer harm if removed from parental 
  care where, if the truth were known, the parents present no risk. Above all, I 
  recognise that this interpretation of the attributable condition means that 
  parents who may be wholly innocent, and whose care may not have fallen below 
  that of a reasonable parent, will face the possibility of losing their child, 
  with all the pain and distress this involves. That is a possibility, once the 
  threshold conditions are satisfied, although by no means a certainty. It by no 
  means follows that because the threshold conditions are satisfied the court 
  will go on to make a care order. And it goes without saying that when 
  considering how to exercise their discretionary powers in this type of case 
  judges will keep firmly in mind that the parents have not been shown to be 
  responsible for the child's injuries. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=20><A name=20>I recognise all these difficulties. This is indeed a 
  most unfortunate situation for everyone involved: the child, the parents, the 
  child-minder, the local authority and the court. But, so far as the threshold 
  conditions are concerned, the factor which seems to me to outweigh all others 
  is the prospect that an unidentified, and unidentifiable, carer may inflict 
  further injury on a child he or she has already severely damaged. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=21><A name=21>In reaching this decision I have not overlooked the 
  observations made by Lord Mackay when promoting the Children Bill. Nor have I 
  overlooked the numerous passages from books and government publications drawn 
  to your Lordships' attention. Many of these appear to take for granted that 
  the deficient care referred to in the attributable condition is that of a 
  parent. Sometimes this is stated expressly; for instance, in Cretney and 
  Masson, <I>Principles of Family Law</I>, 6th ed, (1997) p. 805 ('Significant 
  harm must be attributable to care given by the parent to the child'). In none 
  of these publications do the authors express a view contrary to the 
  appellants' construction of the key phrase in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=22>In the present context all these observations and 
  passages suffer from the drawback that they do not address the particular 
  problem raised in the present type of case. For the most part they are 
  concerned with the straightforward distinction between harm caused by 
  deficient care given by the parents (which satisfies the attributable 
  condition) and harm caused solely by a third party (which does not, unless the 
  parent failed to prevent it). As a proposition of general principle that is 
  correct. But this leaves unresolved the case where, in practice, application 
  of the general principle is thwarted: care is shared between the parents and 
  others, the child has sustained harm from deficient care given by one or other 
  of the carers, but in practice it is impossible to identify which carer is 
  responsible. As discussed above, there are particular difficulties and risks 
  in such a case. Generalised statements, not dealing with this special type of 
  case, provide little or no assistance. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=23>Nor can the appellants gain any succour from previous 
  judicial utterances. None of the judicial dicta to which your Lordships' 
  attention was drawn can properly be read as expressions of judicial view on 
  the point now under consideration. I mention the two statements which were the 
  high-watermarks of this part of the appellants' case. In <I>Northamptonshire 
  County Council v. S. </I>[1993] Fam. 136 two children had suffered physical 
  abuse while in the care of their parents. The father proposed that if a care 
  order were not made the children should be cared for by his mother. The father 
  submitted that, this being so, the threshold conditions were not satisfied: 
  the harm caused by the parents could not be attributed to the care 'likely to 
  be given to [the child] if the order were not made', viz., the care of the 
  grandmother. In rejecting this misconceived submission Ewbank J. said, at p. 
  141, that the 'threshold test relates to the parent or other carer whose lack 
  of care has caused the harm referred to in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">s 
  31</A>(2)(<I>a</I>).' Similarly with regard to the dictum of Wall J. in <I>In 
  re G (A Minor)(Care Order: Threshold Conditions)</I> [1995] Fam. 16, 20, 
  relied upon by Judge Gee in the present case: there, the point at which Wall 
  J. directed his observation, quoted above, was that a parent's consent to a 
  care order is not enough for the purpose of satisfying the threshold 
  conditions. The judge rightly said that no agreement between the parties can 
  relieve the court of its duty to satisfy itself by evidence that the 
  conditions have been met. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=24>The appellants also advanced an argument that the 
  continuation of the care proceedings, with the result that A remained in 
  foster care, infringed the rights of A and her parents to respect for their 
  family life guaranteed by article 8(1) of the European Convention for the 
  Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd. 8969). Once 
  the local authority realised, or should have realised, that it could not prove 
  A was injured by either of her parents, it should have discontinued the 
  proceedings and restored A to her parents' care. I do not agree. The steps 
  taken so far have been no more than those reasonably necessary to pursue the 
  legitimate aim of protecting A from further injury. They are within the 
  exception set out in article 8(2). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=25>I would dismiss this appeal. On the facts found by the 
  judge the threshold conditions were met. 
  <P><B>LORD HOFFMANN</B></P>
  <P>My Lords,</P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=26>I have had the advantage of reading a draft of the 
  speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead. For the 
  reasons he has given, I too would dismiss this appeal. 
  <P><B>LORD CLYDE</B></P>
  <P>My Lords,</P></A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=27>I agree that this appeal should be dismissed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=28>The question here is one of the application of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 
  31</A>(2)(<I>b</I>)(i) of the <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A> 
  to the somewhat special circumstances of the case where the precise source of 
  the harm suffered by the child has not been identified. That subsection 
  relates to the harm or likelihood of harm being attributable to the care given 
  or likely to be given to the child. Harm is more likely to be caused by a 
  deficiency of care rather than its existence. But the word "care" here must be 
  being used in quite a general sense, indicating a standard of care, the 
  standard being, as the section explains, that which it would be reasonable to 
  expect a parent to give him. The section is seeking to exclude harm which is 
  attributable to other factors than the care given to the child, or, as the 
  final part of the subsection says, the child's being beyond parental control. 
  Subject to that situation, harm which is not attributable to the care given to 
  the child, for example, harm which has come about through some unforeseeable 
  event against which no one could have taken any precaution, will not fall 
  within the scope of the section. On the other hand the care which a parent 
  would reasonably be expected to give to a child may include the need to 
  confirm that a child may safely be entrusted to the care of some other person, 
  before handing over the child into the care of that other person. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=29>The principle proposition advanced for the appellants 
  was to the effect that the section requires the court to be satisfied that the 
  harm or likelihood of harm to the child is attributable to the care given to 
  the child by someone who had the care of the child in the sense of being a 
  parent or in the position of a parent. I have not been persuaded that the 
  section should be so construed. In the present case, where the child was 
  certainly harmed by someone and that person was either her father or her 
  mother or a person who acted as a childminder for certain hours of the day I 
  see no necessity for the court to have to be satisfied for the purposes of the 
  section precisely which of the three contributed to the harm. I do not 
  consider that such a restricted construction of the section is appropriate and 
  I reach this view for three reasons.</TD></TR> </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=30>In the first place the language of the subsection does 
  not point to the necessity of identifying the individual who caused or would 
  be likely to cause the harm to the child. The harm, or the likelihood of harm, 
  must be attributable to the care given, or likely to be given, to the child. 
  There is no mention of the author of the harm. It is true that the subsection 
  refers to the care as "not being what it would be reasonable to expect a 
  parent to give to him." But that phrase simply defines the standard or level 
  of care. It is an objective test. The selection of that standard does not 
  restrict the scope of the persons who may be responsible for the care given to 
  the child in the particular case. What the subsection requires is the 
  identification of the incidence of harm, or the risk of harm, attributable to 
  the care of the child, not the identification of the hand which caused, or may 
  be likely to cause, it. That the harm must be attributable to the care given 
  to the child requires that the harm must be attributable to the acts or 
  omissions of someone who has the care of the child and the acts or omissions 
  must occur in the course of the exercise of that care. To have the care of a 
  child comprises more than being in a position where a duty of care towards the 
  child may exist. It involves the undertaking of the task of looking after the 
  child. No formal step is necessarily involved in the taking on of that task, 
  and it is not necessarily taken on by anyone who engages with the child. The 
  section appears to relate to anyone who at least at some period is giving care 
  to the child. That responsibility may be possessed by others than the child's 
  parents or persons who are acting as parents. The question whether a person is 
  giving care to a child is a question of fact. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=31>In this connection I should add that I have found no 
  sufficient guidance for the particular problem raised in the present case from 
  the various quotations to which we were referred whether in debate or 
  commentary prior to the passing of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the Act</A> or 
  thereafter or from the reported decisions, because they were dealing with the 
  matter in a more general way than the present case requires. It is no doubt 
  usually the care of the parents which alone is in issue in the context of care 
  proceedings and it is understandable that it is to the care of parents that 
  reference is naturally made. But that is not to mean that it is their care 
  alone with which the section is concerned. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=32>Secondly, the construction for which the appellants 
  contend involves reading in to the subsection some restriction on its scope so 
  as to limit it to care given by particular kinds of people. A restriction to 
  care given by parents would obviously be too narrow since it would exclude any 
  case where a child was in the care of someone other than a parent, such as a 
  close relative, perhaps because of the absence or the death of the parents. So 
  the appellants seek to include in those giving the care persons referred to as 
  "primary carers." That would at least avoid too restrictive a construction but 
  one looks in vain in the statute for the need to read in such a restriction. 
  Moreover while in practice the term may be conveniently adopted as a term of 
  reference, there may well be problems of definition in determining for the 
  purposes of the statutory provision the precise persons who would qualify as a 
  "primary carer." In a provision such as the present it would be desirable to 
  avoid difficult questions of application. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=33><A name=33>Thirdly, it has to be remembered that the function of 
  the section is to define the jurisdiction of the court in entertaining an 
  application for a care order or a supervision order. In terms of subsection 
  (2) the court may only make such an order if it is satisfied that the 
  circumstances specified in the subsection exist. The section merely opens the 
  way to the possibility that an order may be made. The making of the order 
  requires a much more careful consideration of the case with regard in 
  particular to the matters specified in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 
  1</A>(3) of <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the 
  Act</A>, subject always to the paramount consideration of the child's welfare, 
  as specified in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 
  1</A>(1). So it is reasonable to allow a degree of latitude in the scope of 
  the jurisdictional provision, leaving the critical question of whether the 
  circumstances require the making of an order to a detailed assessment of the 
  welfare of the child. The definition of the occasions on which the court may 
  entertain an application for a care order or a supervision order may usefully 
  be wider than the definition of the circumstances in which the court will take 
  the actual step of handing over the upbringing of the child to a local 
  authority or requiring some supervision of the child's continued care. Even if 
  the court has jurisdiction to make an order it by no means follows that an 
  order will be made. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=34>I would make two further observations. The first is, 
  and the matter cannot be too often repeated, that the intervention by the 
  state into matters of family life may often call for immense caution and 
  restraint. The policy of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the Act</A> is to 
  secure the welfare of children. But that policy recognises that that object 
  will very often be best served by retaining the child in the custody of his or 
  her parents and that very considerable harm may be done by an intervention, 
  however well intentioned. The court may be able to provide an eventual 
  safeguard against inappropriate steps taken in the belief of necessity, but 
  even the making of an application is a step not lightly to be embarked upon. 
  The stress which care proceedings may well impose on the parents may even 
  itself be damaging to the child. If the parents are themselves in fact 
  innocent of any harm to the child the proceedings may simply be defeating the 
  basic purpose and the policy of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the Act</A>. The 
  initiating of proceedings may in some cases be readily and immediately a 
  matter of obvious necessity. But in other cases it may be something not to be 
  embarked upon without careful deliberation and a professional objectivity. The 
  granting of a care order will only be done by the court after consideration of 
  the matters detailed in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 1</A> 
  and in particular the requirement in <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 
  1</A>(5) that the order is only to be made if the making of it would be better 
  for the child than the making of no order at all. The need for caution and 
  restraint is underlined by the provisions of article 8 of the European 
  Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) 
  (Cmd. 8969). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=35>Secondly, while there is a necessity to resolve 
  questions of law in the construction of statutory powers, a matter which 
  involves adversarial debate, the operation of <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the Act</A> should 
  ideally be matter of co-operation between all those bearing responsibility for 
  the welfare of the child, working together to secure that the child's 
  interests are best served. To that end it is obviously desirable so far as 
  possible to minimise formality and to avoid delay in the procedures which 
  require to be followed. Indeed <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s32.html">section 32</A> 
  of <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">the Act</A> 
  expressly recognises that latter necessity. The part played by the court, 
  where it is necessary to have recourse to court proceedings, is vital in 
  securing an impartial and objective resolution of the problem. But even there 
  a degree of flexibility in the management of each case may be appropriate. 
  While the present case has concerned the resolution of what is logically a 
  preliminary point of jurisdiction, a point which in some cases may determine 
  the outcome, it is not to be concluded that this should necessarily constitute 
  a separable episode in the management of a case. But how each case is to be 
  handled, within the scope of the prescribed procedural rules, must be a matter 
  for the judge to whom it has been entrusted. </LI></OL>
