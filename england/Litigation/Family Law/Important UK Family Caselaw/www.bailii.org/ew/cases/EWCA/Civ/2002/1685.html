  <P><B>THORPE LJ:</B> </P>
  <P><B>Introduction</B></P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>This is an appeal from the judgment of Connell J 
  dated 22 October 2001. He conducted the trial of the ancillary relief 
  proceedings brought by Shan Lambert against her husband Harry Lambert for 
  eight days between 2 and 10 October. The judgment that he gave some twelve 
  days later was reserved and handed down. Permission to appeal was given by me 
  on paper on 5 December 2001, the application having been lodged with this 
  court on 16 November following refusal by Connell J on 31 October. An interval 
  of ten months between grant of permission and listing of the appeal is most 
  unusual and in many ways undesirable. The skeleton arguments of the appellant 
  and respondent were settled on 14 November 2001 and 17 May 2002 respectively. 
  In the year between trial and listing of the appeal there have been a number 
  of significant decisions both here and abroad in a fluid area of the law. 
  Accordingly the skeletons were but scant guide to the oral submissions. Such a 
  delay is above all undesirable for the parties. Until the litigation is 
  concluded it is difficult for them to complete the transition from married 
  life to independent life either financially or emotionally. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>The case would be very suitable for use in a 
  textbook on ancillary relief. It is a big money case, and the family fortune, 
  taken by the judge to be £20.2M, was all generated during the marriage. Both 
  husband and wife worked hard for their success. There are two children now 
  grown up and independently rich as a consequence of the diversion of a 
  substantial proportion of the family fortune into a trust for their benefit. 
  There are no complicating factors. Following a take-over of the husband's 
  company after the separation the family fortune is more or less all liquid. 
  The wife has always contended for an equal division. The husband offered her 
  only 30% on the grounds that his special contribution entitled him to the 
  lion's share. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Shape of the Judgment of Connell J</B></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>Having introduced the parties as being then aged 
  respectively 49 (the applicant wife) and 57 (the respondent husband), Connell 
  J summarised the essential history with admirable brevity as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"2. The marriage lasted 23 years. There are two children, a son 
    aged 20 and a daughter aged nearly 19. Both are at university and are 
    wealthy as a result of a trust which was created for them by their parents 
    in 1985 and which is based in Guernsey. The value of the trust assets is now 
    £7.3M and both children in reality are financially independent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>3. The parties' significant wealth arises from the sale of the 
    shares in the company Adscene Ltd in September 1999 for £75M. Of this sum 
    the husband received £19,726,000, the wife received £500,000, and the 
    children's trust received £6M. This company had been floated on the stock 
    exchange in 1987, and the quoted share price at the time of the sale was 
    155p. However the price paid for the shares after negotiation conducted by 
    the husband and the board of directors was 263p. Adscene was a company 
    founded by the husband in March 1973, 9 months before he met the wife and 15 
    months before he married her on 20 June 1974. Adscene produced and 
    distributed a free local newspaper funded by advertising revenue, and it 
    expanded dramatically over the course of the marriage until it was sold as 
    described."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>In paragraphs 4 and 5 the judge recorded the 
  principal area of factual dispute between the parties. The husband's case was 
  that he had launched the company and set it on a successful path prior to the 
  marriage, and that its success during the marriage was the result of his drive 
  and initiative. After the separation he contended that the eventual sale was 
  at an outstanding price achieved by his special negotiating skills. He 
  asserted that his wife's involvement in the company was more or less 
  ornamental. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>By contrast the wife claimed for herself not only a 
  committed contribution as wife and mother but also a contribution to the 
  success of the business which she asserted was pivotal. The judge then 
  recorded Mr Pointer QC's submission that, on the husband's case, his 
  contribution to the creation of the family fortune was exceptional, as defined 
  by this court in <I>Cowan v Cowan</I> <A 
  href="../2001/679.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../2001/679.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 679</a></A>, <A 
  href="../2001/679.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../2001/679.html">[2002] Fam 97</a></A>, and that it significantly outweighed the admittedly full but domestic 
  contribution of the wife. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>In paragraph 6 the judge directed himself as to the 
  law, impeccably in my opinion. He said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The court's fundamental duty however remains to apply section 
    25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to all the circumstances of this case 
    in its attempt to arrive at a fair outcome. Although the issue of the 
    parties contributions to the welfare of the family has been uppermost in the 
    minds of the parties and of their representatives, I observe that that issue 
    can claim no statutory priority in the discretionary exercise. I must have 
    regard to each of the eight matters separately specified in section 25(2) 
    against the background of all the circumstances of the case. Since each of 
    the children is now adult and wealthy as described, their welfare no longer 
    requires 'first consideration'."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>The judge then carried out the section 25 exercise 
  considering in turn each of the section 25(2) criteria. That exercise took him 
  from paragraph 7 to paragraph 28. Between paragraphs 29 and 38 he reviewed 
  those passages in <I>White v White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a> and <I>Cowan v 
  Cowan</I> of particular application to the case. Finally in paragraphs 39 and 
  40 he expressed his conclusion, namely a 63%: 37% split in favour of the 
  husband. That left the wife with assets totalling £7.5M, nearer the figure of 
  £6M for which Mr Pointer QC had contended than the figure of £10.2M for which 
  Mr Mostyn QC had striven. The order was summarised thus in the final 
  paragraph, paragraph 41: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Ringleton Manor worth £1.6M will be transferred to the wife. 
    She has other assets worth £2.8M in round figures. I shall in addition order 
    a lump sum payment in full and final satisfaction of all her claims of 
    £3.1M."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>The Grounds of Appeal</B></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>In his grounds of appeal Mr Mostyn QC attacks the 
  judgment on three fronts: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>i) First he contends that Connell J fell into the trap of gender 
  discrimination by concluding that the husband's contribution as a money maker 
  was special, of greater value than the wife's, and a justification for an 
  unequal division of the family fortune.</P>
  <P>ii) Second he submits that the husband held the proceeds of sale of his 
  shares in the company as trustee pending the outcome of the wife's ancillary 
  relief claims. His subsequent investments were reckless and the wife's 
  entitlement should have been determined on the notional basis that the assets 
  retained the value that they held immediately after the sale of the 
  business.</P>
  <P>iii) Third he says that the judgment focussed insufficiently on the wife's 
  needs as the future owner of the final matrimonial home, with the consequence 
  that the yield from her investment capital would not meet her outgoings.</P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>This appeal was dominated by the first ground, which 
  raises many difficult questions and requires a review of recent authorities 
  both here and abroad. The submission underlying the second ground had been 
  rejected by Connell J on the facts and particularly on his assessment of the 
  husband's good faith. Before us when Mr Mostyn saw that the wind was against 
  him he tacitly abandoned this ground. The third ground requires no 
  consideration of law and principle. It is fact dependent and focuses on a 
  single paragraph in the judgment below. I will defer any consideration of 
  ground three until I have dealt with the first ground. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Connell J's Treatment of Contributions</B></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>How then did Connell J deal with contributions? It 
  is perhaps indicative that the section of his judgment devoted to 
  contributions is the longest. He considered the wife's contribution, dealing 
  first with home life. He said this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The wife's contribution as wife and mother is accepted by the 
    husband. Given that this was a husband who was intent on building up 
    Adscene, who worked long hours to that end and who, on his own account, was 
    often away from home for much of the working week, the contribution made by 
    the wife in this regard was particularly valuable. The husband's 
    contribution vis-a-vis home life and his children was primarily confined to 
    weekends; so that he was a committed but frequently absent husband and 
    father. When home he made the major decisions on modernisation and the wife 
    did her best to implement these when he was away."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>He noted that for at least the first five years of the marriage the wife 
  ran her own business which enabled her to pay for the food and other domestic 
  articles. "This was a constructive contribution in the early days of the 
  marriage and in my view is evidence of the unsurprising fact that the parties 
  treated the marriage as a partnership from an early stage."</P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>He put the wife's contribution to Adscene into 
  proper perspective, thus: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I do not see her role as pivotal. On the other hand it would 
    not be fair to her to describe it as purely incidental, since the husband 
    was able to turn to her for support when such was appropriate or necessary 
    in his view. Thus her contribution to the business was modest when compared 
    to that of the husband, but was not irrelevant or meaningless. Bearing in 
    mind the words of the statute, she made a full contribution by looking after 
    the home and caring for the family, which was supplemented when the need 
    arose by her willingness to support the husband in his efforts to develop 
    the business."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>Turning to the husband, he recorded his case for 
  exceptional contribution which was advanced on three fronts: first that the 
  company was created and established prior to marriage, second that during the 
  years of cohabitation the husband's achievement was the product of his 
  exceptional innovation and talent, third that the sale of Adscene some two 
  years after the separation for a price two and half times the separation value 
  was the product of his exceptional judgement and negotiating skills. As to the 
  first the judge recorded that at the date of the marriage the company was only 
  part way through its first year of trading, that the real growth: "all took 
  place during the course of the marriage and during the time that the wife was 
  supporting the husband as well as looking after his home and bringing up the 
  children. This pot of gold was truly created during the marriage". However in 
  relation to the second phase the judge held that the development "was achieved 
  very largely thanks to the husband's efforts and I have no doubt that he was 
  an excellent businessman and manifestly a successful entrepreneur". Of the 
  third phase, the sale, this was the finding: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The husband is entitled to significant credit for this in view 
    of his early participation in the sale process, but in my view it would be 
    stretching language to describe this part of his contribution as 
    exceptional. No doubt as a successful entrepreneur he displayed the talents 
    of a good negotiator in order to reach a good conclusion. It was a very 
    satisfactory conclusion materially assisted by a good businessman but no 
    more than that."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>Paragraph 26 concluded this section of the 
  judgment with this overall assessment of the husband's contribution: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Thus, as indicated, the husband made a very substantial 
    contribution to the welfare of this family by creating its wealth with 
    occasional assistance from his wife. It would not be right in my view to 
    describe him as a genius, and the most exceptional part of his contribution 
    relates to the very large sum of money acquired by the family as described. 
    It is difficult to envisage a financial contribution in a big money case 
    which is not in one sense exceptional, since by definition exceptional or 
    unusual wealth has been created. Where, as here, that contribution consists 
    of a good idea, initiative, entrepreneurial skills and extensive hard work 
    the question still remains whether that contribution is so special when 
    compared to the contribution of the wife and balanced against the other 
    section 25 circumstances as to demand special recognition."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>The judge's answer to the question that he had 
  posed himself in the final sentence of paragraph 26 comes in paragraphs 39 and 
  40, which not only answer the question but also decide the outcome of the 
  case. I therefore set them out in full: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"There is of course a problem in that any court which decides 
    that the contribution of one spouse is properly described as special may 
    appear thereby to decry the contribution of the other spouse. But that is 
    not in fact the case. The wife, as here, may have made a full domestic 
    contribution and a modest business contribution. That being recognised, it 
    cannot be described as an exceptional contribution without causing offence 
    to language. On the other hand the husband may have accumulated exceptional 
    wealth by displaying over many years an innovative approach coupled with 
    excellent business skills and very hard work. If that is so the court must 
    decide whether (per Lord Justice Mance) ''here was something really special 
    about the skill or effort devoted'' by the husband; and in that case must 
    consider its impact on the appropriate order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In my view the contribution made by this husband is as entitled 
    to the description 'really special' or 'exceptional' as was the contribution 
    made by Mr Cowan. Although I would not describe him as a genius, he was more 
    than just a hard working businessman. He showed innovative visions and the 
    ability to develop these visions (see Thorpe LJ at paragraph 67). He was not 
    merely a successful businessman but an exceptionally active, determined and 
    innovative one (see Robert Walker LJ at paragraph 94). His was a special 
    achievement, via special business skills, acumen and effort (see Mance LJ at 
    paragraph 155). The wife's contribution was as described, without any 
    feature which can be described as 'really special'. In answer to the 
    question posed in argument by Mr Mostyn QC, namely 'What more could the wife 
    have done to justify an award of 50%?' The answer is: 'In the circumstances, 
    probably nothing'. That in my view does not lead to the conclusion that an 
    award of less than 50% is unfair. In a case where the issue of contribution 
    is central to outcome, an award which leaves this wife with approximately 
    37.5% of the assets (£7,500,000) is a fair outcome, which departs from the 
    yardstick of equality in deference to the really special contribution of the 
    husband as described. It also recognises in full the contribution of this 
    particular wife thanks to whose help and support the husband was free to 
    pursue those skills. In percentage terms it is similar to the award made in 
    <I>Cowan</I> where the wife achieved 38%. The husband's proposal of a lump 
    sum of £1.6M would have left the wife with (but) 30%. Such an award would 
    not adequately have recognised the various different elements of her 
    contribution which have been previously described."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>In developing his attack on these paragraphs Mr 
  Mostyn relies upon the decision in <I>White v White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a> and 
  upon five cases that were not available to Connell J. Before coming to his 
  submissions it is convenient to review his authorities. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Recent Authorities</B></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>There are three authorities in this jurisdiction, 
  which require scrutiny. I take them in chronological order, the first being 
  the case of <I>H-J v H-J</I> [2002] 1 FLR 415. Coleridge J on 17 October 2001 
  considered cross-appeals in a case first decided by District Judge Million 
  involving assets of approximately £2,711,000. The District Judge's order gave 
  the wife approximately 45% of the assets. Coleridge J increased the wife's 
  share to equality. In so doing Coleridge J differed from District Judge 
  Million neither in principle nor in approach but on a point of detail 
  irrelevant to this review. I begin by recording the approach of the District 
  Judge. I extract three separate passages from his judgment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>1. "Counsel says that this greater emphasis on contributions is 
    an inevitable consequence of the decision in <I>White</I>. I disagree. It is 
    a temptation but it is not a consequence and to give way to it is to commit 
    the very error which <I>White</I> warns us not to, that is to treat some of 
    the factors in section 25(2), in this case contributions, as more important 
    than the others."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>2. "For my part, I would find it repugnant as a judicial 
    exercise to have, in effect, to draw up a merit table in which fine 
    gradations of contribution give rise to a marginally increased or decreased 
    share in the financial spoils of marriage. By whose standards should I 
    measure such distinctions?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>3. "In this case, it is sufficient, as I find, to record that 
    both the husband and wife each made their full and equal contributions in 
    their respective roles within this long marriage. The family has been 
    financially successful and the job of raising the children and looking after 
    the various homes has also been successful. The role of the husband has been 
    predominant in the financial success and, as I find, the role of the mother 
    and wife has been predominant in keeping house and raising the children. Any 
    further distinction is, in my judgment, impossible to draw on the 
  evidence."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>Of District Judge Million's approach Coleridge J 
  said at 428: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the context of this case in relation to this question of 
    contribution, I unhesitatingly agree with the district judge that no useful 
    distinction can be drawn between the husband's contribution and the wife's 
    contribution. I can find nothing special, exceptional or stellar about the 
    husband's contribution in this case. He has undoubtedly worked diligently 
    and successfully and over a long period to amass the assets that have been 
    amassed over the duration of this marriage. He has had some good years and 
    some very good years, but if the facts of this case lead to a finding of a 
    special contribution, in my judgment it would be the thin end of a wedge 
    being driven right into the heart of the principles underlying <I>White v 
    White</I>. So I unhesitatingly come to the view that the district judge's 
    findings and approach were correct even in the light of <I>Cowan v 
    Cowan</I>."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>At the conclusion of his judgment Coleridge J said 
  this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Underlying this appeal and my decision to allow it there seems 
    to me to be two important points:</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The significance attaching to a particular fractional percentage 
    is more than merely the monetary value it represents. It goes to the core of 
    the party's understanding of fairness. So 50/50 resonates with fairness (as 
    the House of Lords has identified); both parties depart with the sense of 
    being equally valued. There are no winners or losers. Once there is a 
    departure from equality, as there often has to be, however small that 
    departure, one party (more often the wife) is left with a sense of 
    grievance, of her efforts having been undervalued. Understandably, at the 
    time of divorce these considerations matter a great deal to the 
  parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In this case, after a marriage which lasted in excess of 25 
    years, net assets, after deduction of notional sale costs and capital gains 
    tax, have been accumulated amounting to more than £2.7M. Accordingly, there 
    is ample to go round. It would indeed be sad if, in this category of cases 
    (as opposed to those cases where the overall means are less than sufficient 
    and so the needs of children and their carers must inevitably remain 
    predominant), the broad and sweeping reform underlying the speeches in 
    <I>White v White</I> was to become bogged down in a welter of zealous, 
    over-sophisticated and costly forensic analysis, or watered down by judicial 
    reticence."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>The next reported case is a decision of a deputy, 
  Mr Peter Hughes QC in a case of <I>H v H (Financial Provision: Special 
  Contribution)</I> [2002] 2 FLR 1021. The family assets amounted to 
  approximately £6M. The husband was described as a highly successful city 
  solicitor. Mr Pointer, on his behalf, contended that for various reasons his 
  financial accumulations during the course of his professional life amounted to 
  a special contribution: but on behalf of the wife it was submitted that he was 
  no more than a typical successful City solicitor. The judge noted that the 
  wife had also succumbed to the temptation to play up her own contribution. In 
  rejecting Mr Pointer's submission the judge said this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I have considerable sympathy for the husband, who has been 
    highly successful and worked extremely hard over many years and no doubt 
    feels that he has created the wealth that exists today. I am unable to 
    accept, though, that his contribution calls for special recognition as in 
    the cases of <I>Cowan</I> and <I>Lambert.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>It is not easy to define what may amount to a 'stellar' or 
    really special contribution, but rather like the elephant, it is not 
    difficult to spot when you come across it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In <I>Cowan</I> Mance LJ referred to the relevance of the 
    expectations of the parties. In my judgment that is an important 
    consideration. What did the parties anticipate when they set out on their 
    married life together? To what extent have those expectations been realised 
    or have their lives taken a course neither of them would ever have expected 
    and led to riches they would never have contemplated? That was the case in 
    <I>Cowan</I>. It was also so in <I>Lambert</I>. In both cases the success of 
    the marriage far exceeded the parties joint expectations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>That cannot be said here. The husband was already a qualified 
    solicitor with a well-regarded city firm when the parties married. He was 
    set on the career that he has pursued successfully, as both he and the wife 
    hoped for. He has had to work hard and it has not always been easy. The 
    rewards have though been substantial, as no doubt they had hoped they would 
    be, and over the years he has had the full support of the wife in her role 
    of looking after the home and family."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>The last case in this jurisdiction was another 
  decision of Coleridge J given on 2 July 2002 in the case of <I>G v G</I>, as 
  yet unreported. The family assets were in the region of £8.5M. The wife sought 
  a half share. The husband proposed that she should have 40%. The husband had 
  built the family fortune through exceptional hard work and astute business 
  acumen in the field of substantial development and construction projects. The 
  case was largely fought on the issue of the husband's contribution. I cite 
  paragraphs 33 and 34 of the judgment in full: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But how should the court now evaluate those respective 
    contributions in the context of section 25? It is in this area that, 
    needless to say, enormous amounts of forensic energy have been expended. 
    That this should have happened is largely due, of course, to the recent case 
    law on the subject. I have had the benefit of being referred not only to 
    <I>White</I> at length but also all the decided cases which have been 
    reported since that case on this particular subject. The husband's counsel 
    has helpfully produced a folder containing all the relevant authorities. He 
    did this in aid of his argument that the husband's contribution should be 
    not regarded as one of equality with the wife's but of a character and 
    quality which marks it out as special or stellar or outstanding. This, he 
    said, should lead to a finding that (after applying the equality crosscheck 
    required since <I>White</I>) his client should end up with more than half 
    the resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In a number of decisions since <I>White</I> eg <I>Cowan</I> <A 
    href="../2001/679.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/679.html">[2001] 2 FLR 192</a></A> and <I>L v L (Financial Provision: Contributions)</I> <A 
    href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/25.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/25.html">[2002] 1 FLR 642</a></A>, the court has recognised, in an appropriate case, the possibility 
    of a (financial) contribution by one spouse or another at such an 
    extra-ordinary level that it is entitled to special recognition and value. 
    Unfortunately, this has led to this concept becoming the centrally important 
    issue in almost every case particularly where the assets exceed the party's 
    reasonable needs. Hardly a case is heard nowadays than that one party 
    (usually the husband) seeks to establish that he has played a markedly more 
    valuable part in the accumulation of the wealth and the marriage partnership 
    so that he should be specially rewarded by way of a greater share of the 
    assets. I wonder whether, with respect to the members of the Court of Appeal 
    in <I>Cowan</I>, they would have made the extensive remarks they did (about 
    the possibility of a special contribution) if they had realised the forensic 
    Pandora's Box that would be opened in actual practice. The effect is not at 
    all dissimilar to the 'conduct' debates of the 1970s. In those days 
    'conduct' was similarly raised against wives to try and limit their claims. 
    However, the court, recognising the undesirable consequences inherent in 
    those arguments and further the impossibility of fairly adjudicating upon 
    them introduced the concept of 'obvious and gross' very effectively to limit 
    their application. It is suggested by some that these current 'special 
    contribution' debates are reintroducing conduct by the backdoor. I would say 
    by the front door. For what is 'contribution' but a species of conduct. 
    'Conduct' (subsection 2(g)) refers to the negative behaviour of one of the 
    spouses. 'Contribution' (subsection 2(f)) is the positive behaviour of one 
    or other of the parties. Both concepts are compendious descriptions of the 
    way in which one party conducted him/herself towards the other and/or the 
    family during the marriage. And both carry with them precisely the same 
    undesirable consequences. Firstly they call for a detailed retrospective at 
    the end of a broken marriage just at a time when parties should be looking 
    forward not back. In part that involves a determination of factual issue 
    (and obviously the court is equipped to undertake that). But then, the facts 
    having been established, they each call for a value judgment of the worth of 
    each side's behaviour and translation of that worth into actual money. But 
    by what measure and using what criteria? Negative 'conduct' is one thing 
    (particularly where it is recognisably 'obvious and gross') but the valuing 
    of positive 'contribution' varies from time to time. Should a wealth creator 
    receive more because eg his talents are very unusual or merely conventional 
    but well employed? Should a housewife receive less because part of her daily 
    work over many years was mitigated by the employment of staff? Is there such 
    a concept as an exceptional/special domestic contribution or can only the 
    wealth creator earn the bonus? These are some of the arguments now regularly 
    being deployed. It is much the same as comparing apples with pears and the 
    debate is about as sterile or useful."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>When he came to express his conclusions on the 
  issue of contributions he said this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Does that put the husband into that narrow category of wealth 
    creators whose special gift or talent is the foundation of great wealth? I 
    cannot so find in this case. I cannot evaluate the husband's contribution as 
    greater than the wife's without discriminating against her on the grounds 
    that the work she did over just as long a period was of less value than the 
    husband's. That is precisely the approach foresworn by Lord Nicholls. The 
    husband in this case was a hard working, dedicated husband, a father and 
    provider over 32 years. By the same token the wife was a hard working and 
    dedicated housewife, a mother and homemaker over the same period. <I>'Each 
    in their different spheres contributed equally to the family'</I> per Lord 
    Nicholls. To find otherwise would, on the facts of this case in my judgment, 
    amount to blatant discrimination. The husband's role was the glamorous, 
    interesting and exciting one. The wife's involved the more mundane daily 
    round of the consistent carer. That was the way in which the parties to this 
    marriage chose, between themselves, to organise the overall matrimonial 
    division of labour. How can it then be said fairly, at the end of the day, 
    that one role was more useful or valuable (let alone special or outstanding) 
    than the other in terms of the overall benefit to the marriage partnership 
    or to the family?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>At the conclusion of his judgment Coleridge J 
  noted that the case had cost the family over £400,000. He continued: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"That is not especially unusual in this class of case. But the 
    parities are not assisted to achieve compromise when they are encouraged by 
    the law to indulge in a detailed and lengthy retrospective involving a 
    general rummage through the attic of their marriage to discover relics from 
    the past to enhance their role or diminish their spouses. Perhaps 'obvious 
    and gross' has a renewed role here. 'Obvious' because it imports the concept 
    of very easily discernible and 'gross' in the sense of it being abnormally 
    large. Unless this or something similar is soon introduced to curb these 
    debates I fear there is a real danger that the forward looking <I>White</I> 
    innovations will be lost in a sea of post break-up, backward-looking mutual 
    recrimination and the court's task and role in this already uncertain area 
    will thereby be set back at least a generation."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>I turn now to the neighbouring jurisdiction of 
  Northern Ireland whose statutory provision more or less mirrors ours. 
  McLaughlin J decided the case of <I>M v M</I> on 20 December 2001. The overall 
  assets amounted to about £3.67M. The case had a number of complexities which I 
  need not record. I want only to demonstrate the judge's approach to the 
  evaluation of contributions. At page 28 of his approved judgment he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the course of adducing evidence before me counsel sought to 
    tempt me with a bait of this kind. He led evidence, and relied upon it in 
    his closing submissions, that the husband worked very long hours getting out 
    of bed at 6.00am to be at work by 7.00am. His work did not finish until late 
    in the evening as he carried on his working day by supervising Y limited and 
    the other business premises owned by the company. I accept all of that 
    evidence as true, but to concentrate on that and fail to recognise that, 
    whilst he toiled at work on company business, Mrs M from early in the 
    morning was getting the children ready for school, taking them there, 
    running the home during the day, collecting them after school, cooking and 
    cleaning, nurturing them by ferrying them to social, sporting and 
    recreational activities, supervising homework and tutoring them when 
    required, would be to be guilty of the very kind of discrimination warned 
    against by Lord Nicholls. An example of the value of the life's work of Mrs 
    M can be seen today in the accomplishments and personalities of their 
    children. These are the abiding rewards of her labour of love rather than 
    the transient rewards in the form of money produced by the labour of the 
    husband. In the context of this family's life these admirable qualities of 
    both parties are to be considered of equal value. Indeed the words of Lord 
    Nicholls might almost have been written to describe the respective roles of 
    Mr and Mrs M."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>I close my review of Mr Mostyn's authorities by 
  recording a recent significant development in Australia. This is of particular 
  relevance given the extent to which Mance LJ was influenced by Australian 
  authority, and particularly the case of <I>Lynch v Lynch</I> [2000] FamCA 
  1353, [2001] FLC 93-075, in formulating and expressing guidance in the case of 
  <I>Cowan</I> on the assessment of what constitutes an exceptional contribution 
  by the family money-maker. The case in point is <I>Figgins v Figgins 
  </I>[2002] FamCA 688. <I>Figgins</I> was an appeal to the Full Court in a big 
  money case whose distinguishing features were inheritance and a relatively 
  brief marriage. The Full Court consisted of Nicholson CJ sitting with Ellis 
  and Buckley JJ. In giving the judgment of the court Nicholson CJ said that in 
  the Australian jurisprudence special contribution "clearly refers to some 
  special factor of skill or capacity that produces the result that there is a 
  loading in favour of the party providing it". By way of instance he cited the 
  case of <I>Lynch</I> and in particular this paragraph from the judgment of the 
  majority of the Full Court: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"However, there are cases where the performance of those roles 
    has what may be described as 'special' features about it either adding to or 
    detracting from what may be described as the norm. For example in relation 
    to the homemaker role the evidence may demonstrate the carrying out of 
    responsibilities well beyond the norm as, for example, where the homemaker 
    has the responsibility for the home and children entirely or almost entirely 
    without assistance from the other party for long periods or cases such as 
    the care of a handicapped or special needs child. On the other hand, in the 
    breadwinner role the facts may demonstrate an outstanding application of 
    time and energy to producing income and the application of what some of the 
    cases have referred to as 'special skills'."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>Immediately following that citation comes this 
  highly critical appraisal in paragraph 57: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"We are troubled that in the absence of specific legislative 
    direction, courts consider they should make subjective assessments of 
    whether the quality of a party's contributions was 'outstanding'. It is 
    almost impossible to determine questions such as: Was he a good 
    businessman/artist/surgeon or just lucky? Was she a good 
    cook/housekeeper/entertainer or just an attractive personality? We think it 
    invidious for a judge to in effect give 'marks' to a wife or husband during 
    a marriage. We think that this doctrine of 'special contribution' should, in 
    an appropriate case, be reconsidered. We think that the decision of the 
    House of Lords in <I>White v White </I>gives force to these 
  concerns."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>The court returned to this theme at paragraph 131. 
  The court's clear message is that the concept of special contribution reached 
  its zenith in the decision of the full court in <I>Lynch</I>. The impact of 
  <I>White v White</I> in Australia stretches beyond valuing equally the 
  contribution of the male breadwinner and the female homemaker to challenge and 
  seemingly to overrule the proposition that one spouse's contribution might, in 
  an appropriate case, be elevated to such an exceptional degree as to dictate 
  the division of the family fortune. Accordingly it is necessary to cite in 
  full paragraphs 131 – 134 of the court's judgment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In <I>Cowan</I> (supra) Thorpe LJ commented (at 210) in 
    relation to Lord Nicholls' formulation in <I>White</I> (supra) that the 
    ratio of the judgments in <I>White</I> is that the judge's objective is 
    about fairness rather than equality. See <I>Cordle</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1791.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 1791</a>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>We respectfully agree. We think that the important concept that 
    can be said to emerge from <I>White</I> is that, in order to test whether a 
    result is fair, or in Australian terms just and equitable, it is important 
    to ask whether the husband and wife are being treated equally. It states in 
    the clearest terms the modern recognition of equality of the sexes and the 
    need to abandon all forms of discrimination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In the present case we think that the emphasis given by 
    <I>White</I> to gender equality is important in testing the overall result. 
    We think that the lesson to be learned from <I>White</I> is that it is a 
    major error to approach these cases upon the basis that one arrives at a 
    figure that is thought to satisfy the needs of the wife and give the balance 
    to the husband.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In some cases that may produce an appropriate result but in many 
    others it is likely to be productive of a grave injustice. We reject the 
    concept that there is something special about the role of the male 
    breadwinner that means that he should achieve such a preferred position in 
    relation to his female partner. To do so is to pay mere lip service to 
    gender equality. Marriage is and should be regarded as a genuine partnership 
    to which each brings different gifts. The fact that one is productive of 
    money in large quantities is no reason to disadvantage the other. We think 
    that cases such as <I>Lynch v Lynch </I>(supra) and the minority view of 
    Guest J in <I>Farmer v Bramley</I> [2000] FamCA 1615 have missed this point 
    and have led to an imbalance of gender considerations in arriving at results 
    that unduly favour the male partner."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>From these authorities in this and related 
  jurisdictions two consistent themes emerge. First it is unacceptable to place 
  greater value on the contribution of the breadwinner than that of the 
  homemaker as a justification for dividing the product of the breadwinner's 
  efforts unequally between them. Second both the practicality and the value of 
  the exercise of marking the parties to a failed marriage on their respective 
  performances is questioned. Some judges understandably regard it as a 
  distasteful exercise. In this jurisdiction, both in the judgment of District 
  Judge Million and in the judgments of Coleridge J are clear warnings that the 
  excess commonly seen in the litigation of the issue of the applicant's 
  reasonable requirements has now been transposed into disputed, and often 
  futile, evaluations of the contributions of both of the parties. Additionally 
  the decision of the full court in <I>Figgins v Figgins</I> clearly supports 
  Coleridge J's distaste for special contributions and suggests the need for 
  this court to return to the relevance of an asserted special contribution and 
  to reconsider its impact upon the section 25 exercise. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>Before turning to Mr Mostyn's detailed criticisms 
  of Connell J's approach it is very necessary to remember where <I>Lambert</I> 
  stands in the chronology of the authorities cited to us. It was handed down 
  only five days after the decision of Coleridge J in <I>H-J</I> <I>v H-J</I> 
  and it seems reasonable to assume that each was delivered without knowledge of 
  the other. It therefore precedes<I> H v H, G v G </I>and<I> Figgins v 
  Figgins</I>. Had this appeal been listed within three months of the grant of 
  permission, which would be usual enough in family appeals, Mr Mostyn would 
  probably have had only <I>H-J</I> to support his submissions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Counsel's Submissions</B></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>In developing his submissions Mr Mostyn states 
  that the consequence of the decision of this court in <I>Cowan v Cowan</I> has 
  been to create a culture in which the husband in every big money case asserts 
  an exceptional financial contribution, thus provoking lengthy and costly 
  battles. He further states that the judges of the Family Division have divided 
  into those who have embraced the spirit of the decision in <I>White v 
  White</I> and those who have adhered to ingrained discriminatory thinking. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>Mr Mostyn's detailed submissions stop short of 
  wholesale assault on the decision in <I>Cowan v Cowan</I>. He suggests that 
  its acknowledgement of the possibility of special contributions must be 
  confined to the rarest instances and perhaps only where the acquisition of the 
  family fortune is achieved by innovative genius: thus the court can terminate 
  the new forensic industry in the field of contribution. He submits that the 
  fundamental and important rule against gender discrimination must lead to the 
  following plain conclusions: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>i) The contribution of the homemaker is no less valuable than the 
  contribution of the breadwinner and judges should eschew the undesirable 
  exercise of awarding marks to parties for performance during marriage.</P>
  <P>ii) The breadwinner's contribution cannot be rendered special by reference 
  to the size of the product. If the size of the pot alone constitutes a good 
  reason for departure from equality that would mean that the yardstick could 
  never apply in such a case. So too would it be wrong to regard the workaholic 
  breadwinner as having made a special contribution, since invariably his 
  physical and emotional absence from family life casts special burdens on the 
  homemaker. As to entrepreneurs, Mr Mostyn emphasises that they live 
  dangerously: the wife is not shielded when the husband's effort results in 
  bankruptcy. Since she fully shares the risks she should equally share the 
  fruits of success. Finally he suggests that the entrepreneur continues his 
  earning capacity uninterrupted after the division of the family fortune whilst 
  the wife, whose earning capacity has long since been sacrificed, has little or 
  no prospect of reviving it.</P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>Turning to the present case Mr Mostyn emphasises 
  the judge's respective findings that this husband could not be described as a 
  genius whilst the wife could probably have done no more to qualify for an 
  award of 50%. He submits that having categorised the husband's contribution 
  realistically at the outset of paragraph 26 it was not open to the judge to 
  elevate it to something special by taking selected exerts from the judgments 
  in <I>Cowan</I>. Finally he submits that, insofar as exceeded expectations is 
  a relevant consideration, the husband, in advancing the first limb of his 
  claim to special contributions, had asserted that Adscene was immediately and 
  spectacularly successful. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>When Mr Mostyn was asked to explain why, given his 
  clear submissions as to the equal worth of the different contributions, he had 
  devoted so much time and effort at the trial to establish the wife's pivotal 
  business contribution, he responded that it was because he anticipated that he 
  had no other prospect of achieving an equal share in front of Connell J. He 
  pointed out that by contrast he had argued the case of Mrs G in front of 
  Coleridge J on the simple basis that her contribution as homemaker was no less 
  valuable than that of Mr G. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>I turn to the rival submissions of Mr Pointer. He 
  was critical of the scale of the wife's costs which are put at £650,000. That 
  was to be contrasted with his client's costs which he put at £344,000. That 
  was by way of introduction to his first clear submission that the case had 
  been fully tried by a most experienced Family Division judge over the course 
  of eight days. Having seen and heard the parties the judge had arrived at 
  clear conclusions in the exercise of a broad discretion. The speech of Lord 
  Hoffman in <I>Piglowska v Piglowski</I> rendered any interference by this 
  court unprincipled. He characterised Mr Mostyn's submissions as implicitly 
  labelling the decision in <I>Cowan</I> as being inconsistent with that in 
  <I>White</I>. He relied most strongly on the judgment of Mance LJ in <I>Cowan 
  v Cowan</I> which shows that the trial judge is entitled, indeed bound, to 
  make a value judgment as to the respective worth of the contributions of the 
  spouses and to place the husband's financial contribution on the spectrum 
  stretching from the ordinary to the extraordinary. Mr Pointer contests that a 
  new litigation industry has developed around the concept of special 
  contribution or in the area of contributions generally. He disputes that 
  exceeded expectations has become a new field of unnecessary skirmishing. He 
  does not recognise a broad division of the Family Division bench into those 
  who seek to find equality and those who seek to avoid it. He submits that the 
  statute requires the judge to make a full and comparative assessment of the 
  respective contributions of the parties. It is a task that cannot be avoided 
  and judges of the Division have particular expertise in making value judgments 
  of that nature. He supports the judge's view that wherever the family fortune 
  is spectacular the breadwinner will in all probability have made a special 
  contribution. He suggests a threshold of about £10M: above that the fortune 
  made entirely within the marriage by the unaided efforts of one of the spouses 
  is likely to be regarded by the court as a significant achievement and 
  therefore a special contribution to be reflected in the outcome. He is 
  particularly critical of the decisions of Coleridge J who he submits has taken 
  an impermissible judicial stride towards a presumption of equality. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>Turning to the present case Mr Pointer submits 
  that the single question is whether the wealth generated by Mr Lambert allowed 
  a discretionary choice of a 37%:63% split. He argues that the submission that 
  the wife bore additional burdens because of the husband's commitment to the 
  company is to make a stereotypical assumption: here the children were at 
  boarding schools and the family employed staff. Mr Pointer defends paragraphs 
  26 and 40 of the judgment as being proper findings in a territory that is 
  essentially that of the trial judge. As to the suggestion that genius alone 
  deserves recognition in the award, Mr Pointer submits that cases are not to be 
  decided by reference to the IQ of the parties but to what has been achieved by 
  acquisition. Finally he draws a comparison between Mrs Cowan, who contributed 
  over 40 years of marriage during which the husband accumulated a fortune of 
  £11.5M, with Mrs Lambert, who contributed during 23 years of marriage during 
  which her husband achieved a fortune of £27M. Ultimately he suggests that 
  greater restraint on unnecessary future litigation would be achieved by 
  dismissing the appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>In his submissions in reply Mr Mostyn reiterated 
  that this was essentially a discriminatory judgment. If due allowance be made 
  for the lifetime needs of each, the whole of the balance above that 
  calculation was awarded to the husband. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>I will consider the issues raised by these 
  submissions generally and then in their application to the present appeal. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>General Conclusions</B></P>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>Section 25(2)(f) imposes a duty on the court to 
  have regard amongst other matters in particular to: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(f) the contributions which each of the parties has made or is 
    likely in the foreseeable future to make to the welfare of the family, 
    including any contribution by looking after the home or caring for the 
    family."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>How then is the court to approach that duty in the 
  light of the judicial debate revealed by recent authority? The language of the 
  subsection certainly does not suggest any bias in favour of the breadwinner. 
  Lord Nicholls could hardly have expressed more clearly or more forcefully the 
  need to guard against gender discrimination in this as in all areas of the 
  trial judge's assessment. There must be an end to the sterile assertion that 
  the breadwinner's contribution weighs heavier than the homemaker's. It is easy 
  to criticise with hindsight and I do not mean to do so by suggesting that even 
  in October 2001 Mr Mostyn should have had the courage of his convictions. 
  Perhaps more realistically his strategy was driven by the need to respond to 
  the husband's special contribution riposte to the case for equal division. 
  Hereafter there is much to be said in favour of a straightforward presentation 
  of the homemaker's case on this issue unencumbered by unrealistic and 
  strategic claims to significant contribution to the accumulation of wealth. As 
  Robert Walker LJ succinctly said in <I>Cowan</I> the nature of the 
  contributions is intrinsically different and incommensurable. Each should be 
  recognised as no less valuable than the other. Whilst I accept Mr Pointer's 
  submission that the judge has a duty to assess each and every one of the 
  section 25(2) criteria that bear on outcome and equally that judges of the 
  Family Division have great expertise in making value judgments, I do not 
  accept that the duty requires a detailed critical appraisal of the performance 
  of each of the parties during the marriage. Couples who cannot agree division 
  are entitled to seek a judicial decision without exposing themselves to the 
  intrusion, indignity and possible embarrassment of such an appraisal. I fully 
  agree with Coleridge J that any other approach encourages a vain endeavour to 
  recreate historic situations, choices and failings which in the context of a 
  long marriage can never be recaptured fully or accurately. I share the views 
  of District Judge Million cited by Coleridge J in <I>H-J v H-J</I> at 421A. I 
  fully agree with the views expressed by McLaughlin J in the case of <I>M v 
  M.</I> I do not consider that the approach which has been adopted by Coleridge 
  J amounts to an impermissible judicial stride towards a presumption of 
  equality. A distinction must be drawn between an assessment of equality of 
  contribution and an order for equality of division. A finding of equality of 
  contribution may be followed by an order for unequal division because of the 
  influence of one or more of the other statutory criteria as well as the 
  over-arching search for fairness. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>A formula for the equal division of assets on 
  divorce is justly criticised for producing crude and unfair outcomes. It might 
  be unfair to the one who inherited those assets years before the marriage. It 
  might be unfair to the one who needs all the available assets to provide a 
  secure home for the children. However a formula for the equal division of 
  whatever surplus there may be having made fair provision for the assessed 
  needs of each of the parties before the court would produce a fair outcome in 
  many test cases. When chairing the Ancillary Relief Working Group charged with 
  advising the Lord Chancellor on options for reform of section 25 I tabled a 
  proposal for some reduction in the width of judicial discretion by adopting a 
  rebuttable presumption of equal division of any surplus (see Appendix 1 to the 
  report). The proposal met with little support at the time. However it was 
  subsequently reflected in the government's proposal contained in paragraph 
  4.49 of the inter-departmental White Paper Supporting Families published in 
  October 1998. The government's publication in June 1999 of the responses 
  demonstrates that, although the proposal attracted relatively few responses, 
  the vast majority of the responses were in favour. I have since consistently 
  argued that the reform of section 25 along the lines of the government's 
  proposal would be beneficial in many respects, not least in bringing statutory 
  provisions first enacted in 1970 more into line with contemporary social 
  values and expectations. In the absence of legislation and given the 
  encouragement expressed by Lord Nicholls (and more strongly by Lord Cooke of 
  Thorndon) in <I>White v White</I>, Coleridge J is, in my judgment, entitled to 
  regard the crosscheck of equality as an important duty. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>I would not, however, share all the reasoning of 
  Coleridge J expressed in the concluding paragraphs of his judgment in <I>H-J v 
  H-J</I>. It is the objective judicial consideration of fairness rather than 
  the parties' subjective understanding that must determine outcome. Parties who 
  share the perception that equality would be fair to each of them never get to 
  trial. The notion that the judge who orders equal division despatches the 
  parties from the judgment seat without a sense of grievance and with a sense 
  of being equally valued may instance a piece of judicial wishful thinking. I 
  am however in full agreement with the approach expressed in his following 
  paragraph to cases that broadly equate with the case that he there decided. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>Equally the warnings which he, as an experienced 
  specialist amongst specialists, expresses in paragraph 34 of his judgment in 
  <I>G v G</I> must be heeded. Where a family has accumulated a fortune almost 
  too large to dissipate, it might be thought that an expensive and contentious 
  trial would be an unlikely necessity. But all who specialise in this field 
  know that it is not so and accordingly there is a tendency for the case to 
  escalate as it proceeds, each tactical development attracting at least another 
  in response. Therefore if the decision of this court in <I>Cowan v Cowan</I> 
  has indeed opened what Coleridge J describes as a forensic Pandora's Box, then 
  it is important that we should endeavour to close and lock the lid. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>I also endorse concerns that he expresses in his 
  final paragraph at the costs of these tactical exercises. Our concern should 
  be all the greater given that the costs in the present case are estimated to 
  amount to almost £1M. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Special Contributions</B></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>The absence of any legislative review of section 
  25 since 1984 has undoubtedly created problems for the judiciary. (I leave 
  aside the somewhat enigmatic amendment to section 25(2)(g) enacted by the 
  Family Law Act 1996 which is not to be brought into force.) The judgments in 
  <I>Cowan v Cowan</I> that consider the legitimacy of a departure from equality 
  on the basis of exceptional financial contribution must be understood in the 
  context of that case. First the trial had been conducted before the decision 
  in <I>White v White</I> and therefore decided on the basis of reasonable 
  requirements. On appeal it was common ground that in principle the court was 
  free to depart from equality if the husband's financial contribution had been 
  sufficiently exceptional. Both parties submitted that that issue should be 
  remitted for determination by the trial judge. Out of a desire to achieve 
  finality and avoid further costs we declined and ourselves made the value 
  judgment from the evidence and findings at trial, which were of course not 
  specifically directed to the issue. With the advantage of hindsight it seems 
  regrettable, given the significance subsequently attached to our judgments, 
  that the crucial issue was not addressed at trial nor was there any argument 
  before this court on the validity of the principle. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>The authority of <I>Cowan v Cowan</I> cannot 
  therefore be elevated nearly as high as Mr Pointer would have it. In my 
  judgment I based my departure from equality on five considerations, of which 
  the special character of the husband's contribution was but one. Each member 
  of the court advanced different reasons for arriving at the same result. Those 
  who have subsequently attempted to argue that their breadwinning contributions 
  were special have focussed on the judgment of Mance LJ. In his reasoning he 
  placed considerable reliance on the Australian authorities culminating in the 
  decision of the full court in <I>Lynch v Lynch</I>. But a large question mark 
  has been placed against that line of authority by the judgment of the full 
  court in <I>Figgins v Figgins</I>. In <I>Cowan</I> I offered no new approach 
  and certainly no new principle. As I said in paragraph 41, this court could do 
  no more than explore the boundaries by the application of the principles to be 
  found in <I>White</I> on a case by case basis. I recognise that the specialist 
  professions hope for and probably expect more. But just as this court evolved 
  guidelines for the application of the statutory criteria approximately 30 
  years ago (notably of course the concept of reasonable requirements and the 
  Duxbury mechanism for capitalisation of reasonable requirements), so, it seems 
  to me, this court must adopt the same approach now that those guidelines have 
  to a substantial extent become outdated and then proscribed by the decision in 
  <I>White</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>Having now heard submissions, both full and 
  reasoned, against the concept of special contribution save in the most 
  exceptional and limited circumstance, the danger of gender discrimination 
  resulting from a finding of special financial contribution is plain. If all 
  that is regarded is the scale of the breadwinner's success then discrimination 
  is almost bound to follow since there is no equal opportunity for the 
  homemaker to demonstrate the scale of her comparable success. Examples cited 
  of the mother who cares for a handicapped child seem to me both theoretical 
  and distasteful. Such sacrifices and achievements are the product of love and 
  commitment and are not to be counted in cash. The more driven the breadwinner 
  the less available will he be physically and emotionally both as a husband and 
  a father. There is also some justification in Mr Mostyn's emphasis on the 
  extent to which the homemaker frequently sacrifices her potential to generate 
  assets by undertaking the domestic commitment to husband and children. At the 
  same time she risks the outcome of failure and so earns her entitlement to 
  share in the successful outcome. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>In sum I am much more wary of the issue of special 
  contribution than I was in writing my judgment in <I>Cowan</I>. Perhaps Chief 
  Justice Nicholson, who seems poised to banish the phenomenon, may have found 
  the better path. The circumstances set out in paragraph 43 above allow this 
  court to re-evaluate the whole issue. However for the present, given the 
  infinite variety of fact and circumstance, I propose to mark time on a 
  cautious acknowledgement that special contribution remains a legitimate 
  possibility but only in exceptional circumstances. It would be both futile and 
  dangerous to even to attempt to speculate on the boundaries of the 
  exceptional. In the course of argument I suggested that it might more readily 
  be found in the generating force behind the fortune rather than in the mere 
  product itself. A number of hypothetical examples were canvassed ranging from 
  the creative artist via the superstar footballer to the inventive genius who 
  not only creates but also develops some universal aid or prescription. All 
  that seems to me to be more safely left to future case by case exploration. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Exceeded Expectations</B></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>I am doubtful of the origins of this test for the 
  existence of a special contribution. There is no doubt that it originates from 
  the judgment of Mance LJ in <I>Cowan v Cowan</I> at paragraph 161. There he 
  said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The underlying idea is that a spouse exercising special skill 
    and care has gone beyond what would ordinarily be expected and beyond what 
    the other spouse could ordinarily have hoped to do for himself or herself, 
    had the parties arranged their family lives and activities 
  differently."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>The interpretation that Mr Hughes QC in <I>H v 
  H</I> placed on that passage appears from the paragraphs of his judgment which 
  I have cited above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>Certainly Mance LJ posits success going beyond 
  general expectations but when he turns to the subjective hopes of the other 
  spouse he does not relate those hopes to the outset of the venture but rather 
  to what might have been had family lives and activities been differently 
  divided. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>However all that may be I reject the 
  interpretation and approach adopted by Mr Hughes. There is an understandable 
  desire for tests and mechanisms to strengthen judicial confidence in the 
  rationality of the discretionary outcome. But the danger is 
  over-sophistication and complexity that ends up by perverting the statutory 
  task. The concept of special contribution is first formulated and then the 
  concept of exceeded expectations is deployed to demonstrate special 
  contribution. Each provides an opportunity to win a point over the other 
  party. Furthermore the concept of exceeded expectations invites exactly the 
  sort of exchanges that raise the emotional temperature and augment the costs. 
  The exchanges are of questionable relevance to the essential objective 
  assessment of fairness. In any marriage of considerable duration evidence as 
  to what the young couple at the outset of their married life each thought, 
  felt, intended, expected or aspired to is likely to be more imaginative and 
  self-serving than realistic. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Specific Conclusions</B></P>
  <LI value=51><A name=para51>How then do these general conclusions bear on the 
  principle issue argued in the present appeal, the issue of special 
  contribution? Within it there are two questions: (a) was the judge right to 
  find that the husband's contribution was special, and (b) if yes, was he right 
  on that ground, and on that ground alone, to depart so far from equality? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=52><A name=para52>Mr Mostyn criticises paragraph 26 of the judgment, 
  perhaps not entirely fairly, as posing a question at its close which has 
  effectively already been answered in the negative in the opening. It may be 
  that the main foundation for the judge's conclusion was the size of the family 
  fortune, albeit generated by the husband's hard work, determination and 
  acumen. If that be the yardstick there is an obvious danger of gender 
  discrimination. There may be cases where the product alone justifies a 
  conclusion of a special contribution but absent some exceptional and 
  individual quality in the generator of the fortune a case for special 
  contribution must be hard to establish. If I turn to the question posed by 
  Connell J at the end of paragraph 26, a good idea, initiative, entrepreneurial 
  skills and extensive hard work are in my judgment insufficient to attract the 
  label. It is too easy to compile a comparable catalogue of qualities that the 
  homemaker has brought to the other essential contribution. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=53><A name=para53>I have every sympathy for Connell J and every 
  appreciation of his succinct and skilful judgment. I am in no doubt that he 
  looked at the case as he did in part because of the way the applicant's case 
  was fought with its outdated endeavour to present her as pivotal in the 
  company. Furthermore we judge this appeal against a consistent pattern of 
  recent authority which was not available to Connell J. I recognise that he had 
  eight days of evidence in which to assess the parties, and particularly the 
  special qualities of the husband. I recognise the force of Mr Pointer's 
  submission that it is not for us to interfere with such assessments. However 
  there is a gulf between the approach of Connell J in <I>Lambert</I> and the 
  approach of Coleridge J in <I>H-J</I>, each writing independently and handing 
  down within a week of each other. The two approaches cannot be reconciled and 
  in my judgment the approach of Coleridge J must be supported. Once Connell J 
  had concluded that the husband was not a genius and that the wife could not 
  have done more, he should not have elevated one contribution above the other, 
  given that the two are essentially incommensurable. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>Even if Connell J was entitled to find the 
  husband's contribution special it would not in my opinion justify so great a 
  departure from equality. If it be conceived that each needed approximately 
  £7.5M to maintain their respective lifestyles the surplus of £5.2M all went to 
  the husband. That hardly satisfies the fairness test. If outcomes become 
  driven by comparative assessment of contribution then there is an obvious 
  danger of over-emphasis on that criterion with a corresponding under-emphasis 
  of others. Of course, as I have said before, the special characteristics of 
  each case draw to them some of the criteria whilst others are evidently not 
  engaged. We must therefore ask which criteria, other than contribution, were 
  engaged here and how did the judge deal with them? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>He dealt with each of the section 25(2) 
  considerations in turn. First he carefully considered the assets, as to the 
  extent of which there was no great contention, although much dispute as to 
  whether after the sale of Adscene the husband had exercised his control and 
  management irresponsibly or selfishly. All those issues were resolved in the 
  husband's favour. Next came needs. This is an important paragraph to which I 
  will return. On the standard of living, Connell J recorded that it had 
  improved dramatically, achieving a rating of high from the mid 1980s onwards 
  and, by the 1990s, extravagant. He concluded that each should be able to enjoy 
  a comparable standard for the future. In relation to age and duration of 
  marriage Connell J recorded the facts: the husband then 57, the wife then 49, 
  the marriage 23 years in duration. However nothing follows as to how those 
  considerations bore on outcome. The lengthy section dealing with contributions 
  I have already reviewed. In relation to the three remaining subsections 
  (disability, conduct and loss of pension) the judge simply recorded that 
  neither party had suggested that these considerations had any bearing on the 
  case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Age and Duration of Marriage</B></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>With all due respect to Connell J I consider that 
  some reflection should have been given to age and duration of marriage. As to 
  the latter it is not just the duration of 23 years but the fact that they span 
  the most productive period of the wife's life from 22 to 45. Not only are 
  those the years of child bearing and rearing but those are the years in which 
  an adult develops talents and expends the force of energy in the chosen work. 
  The wife had a modest business which she gave up. What sort of an independent 
  career she sacrificed is a matter of speculation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>In my judgment the respective ages of the parties 
  are also relevant. Of the fortune of £27.5M derived from the sale of Adscene, 
  £7M has been allocated to the children. The greater part that remains is 
  primarily, if not exclusively, for the parties to meet their needs during the 
  remainder of their lives. Applying actuarial tables the wife has a further 
  span of 35 years whilst the husband has a further span of about 23 years. This 
  consideration may require some reflection in an assessment of the respective 
  future needs of the parties, the consideration to which I now turn. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Needs</B></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=para58>At the outset the judge considered two 
  inter-connected areas of dispute, the wife's desire to remain at the former 
  matrimonial home, Ringleton Manor, and her asserted need for an income of 
  £460,000 a year net. As to the first the judge held that the wife's proposal 
  was reasonable. However the judge did not make any finding as to what her 
  expenditure would be as the owner/occupier of the property. The husband had 
  advanced a figure of £194,000. Connell J merely criticised the forensic 
  exercise of preparing for the wife a budget that was plainly inflated. He 
  said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I question the value of an exercise of this nature in a case of 
    this type. It is manifest that there are ample funds available to provide 
    properly for the future needs of both spouses. In such a case it is for the 
    wife (or the husband as the case may be) to decide whether a particular 
    aspect of proposed expenditure is justifiable in the circumstances …. In 
    short the Duxbury type exercise which has been undertaken in this case for 
    illustrative purposes as well as by way of quantification of the wife's 
    claim in part is in my view of little value. The wife will have available to 
    her the home which she chooses and sufficient income to enable her to 
    maintain a high standard of living. The same will be the case for the 
    husband …. Whichever solution is preferred by the court in this case both 
    parties will be well able to satisfy their financial needs and to meet their 
    obligations and responsibilities for the foreseeable future."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>Mr Mostyn's argument focuses on the final 
  sentence. The solutions to which the judge refers are the solution of £10.2M 
  or the solution of £6M advanced by the wife and the husband respectively. But 
  Ringleton Manor and its contents count for £1.878M. On the judge's eventual 
  award of £7.5M the sum remaining to the wife for income production is 
  therefore £5,622,000. At an annual yield of 4.5% gross, less tax, that would 
  leave the wife with an annual income of £150,000 approximately without 
  amortisation. So she would be forced to draw down capital in order to remain 
  in the former matrimonial home, even on the husband's assessment of her need 
  at £190,000 a year. Contrast the position of the husband. Under the judge's 
  division he has about £12.7M. Assuming for him the same investment in housing 
  and chattels of £1.878M he has a sum for income production of £10.8M which 
  would produce for him at the same assumed rate nearly £300,000 per annum after 
  tax without amortisation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=60><A name=para60>In my judgment Mr Mostyn succeeds in this 
  submission which Mr Pointer could not convincingly undo. Assuming in the 
  husband's favour that his present residence in Monaco where he is not subject 
  to United Kingdom tax is only short-term, I see no possible reason why the 
  wife alone should be required to amortise in order to meet the cost of living 
  in the property which the judge has found that she reasonably occupies. If 
  there were any consideration of amortisation then the wife's greater life 
  expectancy enters the calculation. Finally there is validity in Mr Mostyn's 
  submission that after the sale of Adscene the husband resumed his 
  entrepreneurial activities with the prospect of a further decade of successful 
  business. By contrast the wife has no realistic prospect of augmenting the 
  yield from her investment capital. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=61><A name=para61>I conclude that Connell J fell into error in 
  holding that however the family fortune were divided both parties would be 
  able to satisfy their financial needs for the foreseeable future. Had there 
  been a finding as to the wife's reasonable income needs as the occupier of the 
  final matrimonial home (a figure that would presumably be less than half her 
  assertion but no less than the figure for which the husband contended) then it 
  would have become critical to consider whether division of assets at the level 
  proposed by the husband or at any level less than that for which the wife 
  contended, would indeed meet her future needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=62><A name=para62>I have therefore reached the conclusion that the 
  wife is entitled to succeed in this appeal. The only justification for a 
  departure from equality asserted by the husband cannot be upheld without 
  discrimination. Of importance too is the rival consideration that the wife's 
  needs, given the respective ages of the parties, point towards equality. I 
  would therefore increase the wife's lump sum from £3,152,732 to £5,751,474 or 
  such other sum as counsel may agree to be necessary to bring her to a 50% 
  share. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=63><A name=para63>I am conscious that this conclusion does little to 
  increase clarity or predictability of outcomes. However any expectation of 
  such was surely unrealistic. Specialists in the field, whether judges, 
  practitioners or academics, have yet to suggest a principle or mechanism that 
  might produce greater certainty or predictability within the very wide 
  discretionary field for which parliament opted in 1984. Such new approaches as 
  have been advocated or debated all require legislation for their introduction. 
  Accordingly it must be recognised that a largely unfettered judicial 
  discretion comes at a price. </A>

  <LI value=65><A name=para65>Notwithstanding the understandable submissions of

  agree that this appeal should be allowed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=66><A name=para66>This is for two main reasons. The first relates to 
  the evaluation of the parties' differing contributions, in which respect 
  Connell J made four crucial findings of mixed fact and value-judgment, namely: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>i) that "…. the parties treated this marriage as a partnership from an 
  early stage";</P>
  <P>ii) that "…. this pot of gold was truly created during the marriage";</P>
  <P>iii) that "…. in answer to the question posed in argument by Mr Mostyn QC, 
  namely 'what more could the wife have done to justify an award of 50%?', the 
  answer is: 'in the circumstances, probably nothing'"; and</P>
  <P>iv) that "…. it would not be right in my view to describe [the husband] as 
  a genius and the most exceptional part of his contribution relates to the very 
  large sum of money acquired by the family as described".</P>
  <LI value=67><A name=para67>Without overlooking the judge's other findings as 
  to the husband's qualities as an exceptionally active determined and 
  innovative businessman able to develop his visions, it does seem to me that 
  the four findings at (i) to (iv) above flagged up cumulatively the risk of 
  unfairness, if unequal weight were to be given to the differing nature of the 
  parties' respective contributions to the family's welfare according to their 
  particular roles in the marriage. </A>

  <LI value=68><A name=para68>The recent authorities examined by Thorpe LJ 
  further developing the law both here and elsewhere since the decision under

  make this point not only the more forcefully but, in my view, conclusively. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=para69>I agree that it is not possible to define once and 
  for all, by way of some formulaic label, the precise characteristics of the 
  fortune-maker (or fortune-making) required in the paradigm case such as this, 
  in order that when the proposed distribution of the resources is checked 
  against the 'yardstick of equality', the fully contributing homemaker should 
  receive a lesser share of the wealth than the fortune-maker. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=70><A name=para70>However, those characteristics or circumstances 
  clearly have to be of a wholly exceptional nature, such that it would very 
  obviously be inconsistent with the objective of achieving fairness (ie it 
  would create an unfair outcome) for them to be ignored. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=71><A name=para71>I do not accept Mr Pointer's submission that to 
  state the position in this way represents an 'impermissible judicial gloss' on 
  one of the section 25 statutory criteria (ie the requirement to consider the 
  parties' contributions). It is rather to apply the guidance of the House of 
  Lords in <I>White v White</I>, recognising that where – in the paradigm case 
  like this – the homemaker has given of her (or his) utmost, then any weighting 
  of the impact of contributions in favour of the fortune-maker is almost always 
  going to be unfair, since ex hypothesi the pure homemaker neither has the 
  opportunity to create wealth, nor in the nature of things the ability to have 
  any meaningful comparative 'value' accorded to her (or his) particular 
  contributions to the welfare of the family. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=72><A name=para72>I conclude that, as the law has now been further 
  developed, such wholly exceptional characteristics and circumstances as are 
  referred to in paragraph 70 above did not exist in this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=73><A name=para73>The second main reason for allowing this appeal, 
  being more of fact and less of general importance, relates to the criterion of 
  the wife's needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=74><A name=para74>As demonstrated by Thorpe LJ, her income position 
  under the existing award would be insufficient to enable her to continue to 
  reside at Ringleton Manor, as was held by the judge to be a reasonable 
  aspiration, unless (even on the basis of the lower budget put forward by the 
  husband for her to do so) she were to amortise part of her capital. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=75><A name=para75>For her to have to amortise capital when the 
  husband himself would not have to do likewise, does not seem to me to meet the 
  aim of achieving fairness in the circumstances of a long marriage such as 
  this, during which the family fortune was created and within which, as found, 
  each party gave respectively of his/her all. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=76><A name=para76>I agree with Thorpe LJ that the wife's 
  presentation below of an excessively high budget would have tended to divert 
  attention away from this significant point, as would the very fact of the 
  judge's conclusion that the husband's contribution by way of wealth creation 
  called for an unequal distribution of the available resources. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=77><A name=para77>For these reasons and the others expressed more 
  fully by Thorpe LJ, I too would replace the order of the learned judge with 
  one achieving an equal division of the overall capital resources. </A>
  <P></P></LI></OL>
