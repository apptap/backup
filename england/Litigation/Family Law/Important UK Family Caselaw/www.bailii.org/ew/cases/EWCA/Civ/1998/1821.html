<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE NOURSE: Lord Justice Henry will give the first 
Judgment. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE HENRY: This is an application for leave to apply 
for judicial review made on behalf of Miss Shirley West, after refusal by the 
single judge, Mr Justice Connell. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The applicant wishes the Secretary of State for Social Security 
or the Child Support Agency to make a maintenance assessment in respect of a 
former cohabitee. She says that he, Mr Philip Spiers, should be assessed under 
section 26 because he comes under Case F, which applies where: "(a)the alleged 
parent has been found, or adjudged, to be the father of the child in question - 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(i) in proceedings before any court in England and Wales which 
are relevant proceedings for the purposes of section 12 of the Civil Evidence 
Act 1968; ... <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>... and that finding or adjudication still subsists ..." 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The line taken by the respondent is that there has been no such 
finding or adjudication, as required by that section; alternatively, that it 
does not subsist; or alternatively, that there is another remedy which the 
applicant should avail herself of, namely, a reference to the court for a 
declaration of parentage under section 27. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The facts are these. The applicant and Mr Spiers cohabited for 
15 years between 1974 and 1989. During that time two children were born to the 
applicant, in 1985 and 1987 respectively. After the separation of the parties, 
no payments for maintenance were made by Mr Spiers, despite the fact that there 
seems to have been at one point an order. In 1993 the Child Support Agency took 
over responsibility for the maintenance assessment and applied to Mr Spiers for 
maintenance. Mr Spiers then applied for contact orders and, when filling in the 
application form for that purpose, he stated that he was the father of the 
children. In April 1994 the Child Support Agency made an interim maintenance 
assessment and arrears finding against Mr Spiers. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In June 1994 Mr Spiers applied for a parental responsibility 
order in respect of the two girls. The basis of the application was that he was 
the children's father. That was not contested by the mother. As a result, 
District Judge Jolly made a consent order on 8th July ordering that further 
proceedings be transferred to the Llandrindod Wells County Court; that there be 
interim contact between the applicant and the children by way of telephone calls 
and letters; that the applications for contact be adjourned generally; and that 
the applicant was to have parental responsibility for the two children, with 
liberty for either party to apply. When the Child Support Agency started chasing 
Mr Spiers for arrears, he then, in July 1995, denied paternity, and in February 
1997 the parental responsibility order was discharged. It was not discharged on 
the basis that Mr Spiers was not the father, but that it was inappropriate in 
all the circumstances. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Three points are made on behalf of the applicant. The first is 
that there has been a finding or adjudication that Mr Spiers was the father of 
the children in question before District Judge Jolly. When parties have 
cohabited for a long time, normally there will not be any dispute about 
paternity. There was a clear admission on the form applying for interim contact 
that Mr Spiers was the father. That was not contested, and so there was no 
discussion of that issue before the judge. The application was made and the 
judge's adjudication were both predicated on the basis that the applicant was 
the father. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>It is submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that that 
was not clear-cut enough because, as the matter was not in issue, there was no 
conclusion upon an inquiry of fact. I, for myself, would regard the contrary 
view (namely, that there was an adjudication on this question of fact) as well 
and realistically arguable. It also seems to me that, when the parental 
responsibility order was discharged in February 1997, it did not alter the fact 
that Mr Spiers had been adjudged to be the father of the child in question, and 
did not cast any doubt on that adjudication. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In relation to the third point, that of the alternative remedy 
available under section 27, that remedy involves a reference to the court and 
the applicant's co-operation in that reference, and it may, as I understand it, 
involve physical material being taken from the applicant for DNA testing. The 
applicant's case is that, if she is right on the main point, there is no need to 
go back to the court. Again it seems to me to be well arguable that that is a 
course that she is entitled to pursue, and that she is not being in any way 
unreasonable in choosing to follow that course. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>I would, therefore, for my part, grant leave. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE ROBERT WALKER: I agree. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE NOURSE: I also agree. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Order: application for leave to appeal granted; belief expressed 
by the court that this is a case which ought to be expedited in the Crown Office 
List. <BR></DIV>
