<p align="right"><u>Friday 7th July 1995</u></p>

<p><a name="para1">LORD JUSTICE WAITE: This appeal, concerning the
disputed beneficial interests in a matrimonial home, was heard during
the week in which the Law Commission published its Sixth Programme of
Law Reform. Item 8 of the Programme recommends an examination of the
property rights of home-sharers. The Report comments that "the present
rules are uncertain and difficult to apply and can lead to serious
injustice." Though that was a reference to the problems of unmarried
home-owners, the rights of married occupiers can be equally problematic
- as the present case shows - when the claims of third parties such as
creditors or mortgagees become involved. The economic and social
significance of home-ownership in modern society, and the frequency
with which cases involving disputes as to the property rights of
home-sharers (married or unmarried) are coming before the courts,
suggest that the Law Commission's intervention is well-timed and has
the potential to save a lot of human heartache as well as public
expense. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para2">Mr and Mrs Cooke were married on 31 July 1971. After
the wedding they moved into their new home "Thatchatty, 58 High Street,
Abbotsley Cambridgeshire (to which I shall refer as "the property"). On
1 July 1971, shortly before the marriage, Mr Cooke, who is the first
defendant in the proceedings but has played no part in the current
appeal, had taken a conveyance of the property in his sole name. He was
then 19 years of age and his fiancée was a little older. The purchase
price was £8500, of which £6540 was provided by way of a mortgage from
the Leeds Permanent Building Society. The balance of the purchase price
and costs was paid in cash provided as to £1100 by Mr Cooke's parents,
and as to the remainder by a contribution in the region of £1000 by Mr
Cooke out of his own savings. The mortgage was of the conventional
Building Society type providing for repayment by monthly instalments of
capital and interest.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para3">Mrs Cooke, who is the second defendant in the action
and appellant in this appeal, was a student teacher at the time of the
wedding and qualified soon afterwards. Virtually from the outset
husband and wife were both working - she as a teacher and he as a
self-employed proprietor of a business selling kits for the making of
lampshades. Mrs Cooke did not make any direct payments of mortgage
instalments but was discharging other household outgoings out of her
earnings. She remained in work, although there were brief spells of
part-time working when their three children were born in 1972, 1974 and
1984 respectively.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para4">On 27 September 1971 a second mortgage was taken out
on the property in favour of the National Westminster Bank. It was
executed jointly by Mr and Mrs Cooke (who were described in it as
together constituting the mortgagors) to secure their overdraft with
the Bank. This second mortgage was redeemed on 18th May 1972.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para5">The Building Society Mortgage was replaced from 26
June 1978 by a general mortgage of that date in favour of the Midland
Bank ("the Bank") who are plaintiffs in the proceedings and Respondents
to this appeal. This mortgage (which I shall call "the mortgage") was
granted by Mr Cooke in his sole name and charged the property to the
Bank to secure repayment on demand of the business overdraft of Mr
Cooke's company. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para6">From the outset of their occupation the wife devoted
much time and energy to the improvement of the house and garden. The
judge's finding about that was:</a></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para6">"Quite plainly the wife was
engaged in a considerable amount of work on the property, with or
without the assistance of contractors, on the interior of the property
and in particular the garden. The works she has described in her
evidence - and I do not propose to go through it in detail - could be
described as falling into the three categories of redecoration,
alterations/improvements and repair."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para7">It is common ground that the evidence which the
judge was there summarising included undisputed evidence that she had
paid a number of contractors' bills out of her own earnings. It will be
convenient to refer to Mrs Cooke's efforts in this respect as "the
maintenance and improvement contribution".</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para8">The Court of Appeal decision in <u>Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank v Boland</u> (later to be affirmed on appeal to the House of Lords in </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/4.html">[1981] AC 487</a></a>)
was reported in April 1979. Soon afterwards the Bank requested Mrs
Cooke to sign a form of consent to any present or future right or
interest which she might have in the property being postponed to the
Bank's security under the mortgage. I will refer to that as "the
consent form". She did so sign it on 12th July 1979 at a meeting with
officials of the Bank attended by her husband and herself. The judge's
findings as to what transpired at that meeting were firstly that Mr
Cooke stated to her in front of the Bank officials that she had no
alternative but to sign the consent form, and secondly that she was
visibly upset by the whole transaction.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para9">On 28 May 1981 Mr and Mrs Cooke together executed a
second charge on the property to secure their liability under a joint
guarantee they had executed as security for a business loan to Mr
Cooke's company.</a></p>

<p><a name="para10">In about 1984 Mrs Cooke brought Married Womens
Property Act proceedings against Mr Cooke in the county court in which
an order was made by consent declaring that the property was held by
the spouses jointly. That order was recited in a Conveyance of 12th
March 1985 made between the spouses and transferring the property into
their joint names, holding beneficially as tenants in common.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para11">On 15 July 1987 the Bank brought these present
proceedings against Mr and Mrs Cooke as first and second defendant
respectively in the Bedford County Court claiming payment of the sum of
£52,491 then claimed to be due under the mortgage and possession in
default of payment.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para12">On 4 November 1987 Mrs Cooke served a defence in
the action. It contained firstly a plea that the mortgage was
statute-barred, secondly a claim that her signature to the consent form
had been procured to the knowledge of the Bank by Mr Cooke's undue
influence, and thirdly an assertion that she was entitled to a one half
beneficial interest in the property over-riding any interests of the
Bank under the mortgage. She counterclaimed for declarations against
the Bank that she was the joint legal owner of the property and
entitled to one half of the beneficial interest free of any claim or
interest of the Bank. The Bank joined issue by their Reply and Defence
to Counterclaim of 25 January 1988.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para13">It does not appear that any defence was served by
Mr Cooke, who by this time was living apart from his wife, she
remaining in occupation of the property with the children. The
litigation moved extremely slowly, but eventually the action was listed
for trial before Judge Hamilton in the Hitchin County Court on 5th
February 1992. Mr Cooke attended in person and protested that he had
not been given notice of the hearing, of which he had learned only the
previous day when Mrs Cooke told him about it. There is no transcript
of the exchanges which then took place, but it seems clear that the
judge, who was understandably alarmed at the prospect of further
adjournment of proceedings that had taken so long to come trial, took
the view that the action could be dealt with in two bites - with the
issues between the Bank and Mrs Cooke being tried at once, and those
between the Bank and Mr Cooke on some future occasion at which Mr Cooke
could be represented. In the meantime Mr Cooke would be allowed to
attend the first stage as a party in person.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para14">The primary issue before the court was the
allegation of undue influence upon the signing of the consent form, and
the greater part of the evidence was devoted to that issue. Evidence
was also given, however, by Mr and Mrs Cooke as to the terms on which
the property was first purchased. It was common ground that at the time
of purchase there had been no discussions between them as to the name
in which the property should be taken, and both stated positively that
there had been no discussion and no agreement as to how the property
should be owned beneficially. It was also common ground that they each
had their own separate bank accounts, that there was no joint account,
that Mr Cooke made the payments on the Building Society mortgage until
it was redeemed and replaced by the mortgage, and that Mrs Cooke made
no savings from her earnings as a teacher, but applied them in the
payment of household and decoration bills. It has been common ground at
this appeal hearing that although it is undisputed that Mr Cooke paid
the mortgage instalments under the original Building Society mortgage
and also some of the household bills and that Mrs Cooke paid other
bills out of her own earnings, there was insufficient evidence before
the judge as to the earnings of the parties and the amount of the
outgoings to enable any conclusion to be drawn as to whether (and if so
to what extent) Mr Cooke's ability to pay the instalments under the
Building Society mortgage was dependent upon the contribution made by
Mrs Cooke to other outgoings. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para15">Mr Cooke gave evidence about the contributions to
the original purchase price. The relevant passage from his evidence in
chief is worth quoting, not only because a submission is founded upon
it, but because it provides a vivid illustration of the difficulties
which these cases pose for the honest recollections of witnesses and
the barrenness of the terrain in which the judges and district judges
who try them are required to search for the small evidential nuggets on
which issues as to the existence - or the proportions - of beneficial
interest are liable to depend.</a></p>

not appear on the title deeds?</a></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">A No.</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">Q So far as you were concerned, at the
time you were signing the conveyance, going through the legalities with
the solicitors, whose house did you think this was to be once the
transaction was completed?</a></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">A Well it was very similar to sort of
recalling what was happening 10 or 12 years ago. To be truthful, I
can't actually remember, but I always thought of it as "our house". It
was just because I did.....Jane was at teacher training college in
Eastbourne .....</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">Q Do you remember anything in relation to the building society and obtaining the mortgage - any problems which arose there?</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">A Only in respect of when I told them that
Jane was a student and they said they didn't want that on the form,
basically, because she had no income, you see, so.....</a></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">Q Do you now have any recollection of
discussing before acquisition or at the time of acquisition or at the
time you actually got married with your wife the precise arrangements
in relation to the house?</a></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="para15">A Not really, no. We were just happy, I suppose, you know.</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para16">He was not cross-examined on that evidence. The
judge also heard evidence from Mrs Cooke as to the maintenance and
improvement contribution, on which she was not challenged. She too
agreed in evidence that there had been no discussion or agreement at
the time of acquisition as to the terms on which the property was to be
owned.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para17">In his judgment delivered on 10th February 1992
Judge Hamilton dealt as follows with the initial contributions to the
purchase price.</a></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para17">"The husband, however, told me
that of the £2,000 cash that was required for the deposit he put in
£900 and his parents had given -- he first used the word "us" - the
£1,000 to make up the rest. He went on to say, "My father gave the
money to me to buy the house. My wife's parents paid for the wedding.
My parents put £1,000 towards the house as a present."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para17">What am I to make of that? I
am concerned, of course, with events that happened over 20 years ago,
with a wife who, hardly surprisingly, cannot remember any of the
details and with two parties who, equally unsurprisingly, gave no
thought whatsoever to the legal effect of what they were getting into.</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para17">The husband, however, said
this in his evidence: "I can't remember whose house it was meant to be
but I always thought it was our house."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para17">In the normal course of
events, if parents make gifts by way of wedding presents to their
offspring, those gifts are considered to be gifts jointly to the
husband and wife. As a matter of practice it has become the position -
and certainly was when Married Women's Property Act cases had to be
thrashed out item by item under voluminous schedules - that, subject to
adjustment, those specific items which could be identified as having
come from one set of parents rather than the other, should remain after
the marriage had broken up in the possession of the person whose
parents had so contributed. No such rule, however, applies to money.</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para17">I can see here, assuming that
I accept the husband's evidence, which I do, no reason to depart from
the usual assumption that this gift made by his parents towards the
purchase of a house in which he and his fiancée were to live, being
their contribution towards what can be loosely described as the overall
part of the wedding, should be regarded as otherwise than a joint gift
of money to the husband and the wife. If her share of that £1,000, call
it £500, then went into the overall sum it would appear of about
£8,000, then, in my judgment, she plainly acquires an equitable
interest which, at the date of acquisition of the property, bears the
relationship of £500 to £8,000. The precise amount may very well have
to be decided at a later stage, but there is no question but that such
a proportion amounts to a substantial interest in the property which is
certainly otherwise than <u>De minimis</u>, and accordingly I hold that she had, upon the purchase of that property, an equitable interest in it."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para18">That was followed by the finding (already quoted)
as to Mrs Cooke's maintenance and improvement contribution. The judge
held that it did not amount to a contribution to the purchase price,
with the result that her beneficial interest depended upon her monetary
contribution (i.e. her half share of the joint wedding present from her
in-laws) alone. There can be no doubt that this holding was entirely
justified by the authorities, ranging from <u>Pettitt v Pettitt</u> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/5.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/5.html">[1970] AC 777</a></a> to <u>Lloyds Bank v Rosset</u> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/14.html">[1991] 1 AC 107</a></a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para19">The remainder of the judgment was devoted to the
issue of undue influence, on which the judge found in favour of Mrs
Cooke, holding that the consent form was not binding on her and that
her equitable interest took priority over the claims of the Bank. He
then dealt briefly with the issue of limitation, on which he found in
favour of the Bank that its claim was not statute-barred. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para20">At the end of his judgment the judge indicated that he expected the adjudication of the current proportions of the spouses'</a></p>

<p><a name="para21">beneficial interests to be dealt with at the second
stage of the hearing, when the husband would have an opportunity of
professional representation. That was supported by Mr Gore, counsel for
Mrs Cooke. Mr Bergin, counsel for the Bank, submitted, however, that
the judge should make a ruling on the proportions there and then, on
the ground that he had heard all relevant evidence, made all necessary
findings and heard submissions from counsel for the only two parties
who were affected by the proportions, namely the Bank and Mrs Cooke (it
being common ground that the mortgage debt had by then reached a figure
which far exceeded the value of any beneficial interest that might be
asserted on behalf of the husband). The judge, acceded to that
submission, no doubt taking the realistic view that since he already
had the husband before him as a party and a witness, and that Mr
Cooke's interests in asserting the highest possible beneficial interest
in the property were identical to those of the Bank seeking to enforce
its charge, it would be pointless to postpone a decision as to current
entitlement. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para22">The judge accordingly proceeded to announce his
concluded finding in regard to the proportions of beneficial
entitlement. He held that Mrs Cooke was entitled to a beneficial
interest of 6.47% of the property, that being the proportion born by
her half of the wedding present (£550) to the total cost (£8500). It is
implicit in that finding (though the judge did not spell it out in so
many words) that he did not regard any other aspect of the course of
dealing between the parties - whether it be the maintenance and
improvement contribution, or the assumption of mortgage liability, or
the sharing of household expenses or any other factor - as capable of
having any influence at all upon the quantification of the current
interests of husband and wife.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para23">The Judge's final order accordingly dismissed the
Bank's claim to possession as against Mrs Cooke, adjourned the Bank's
claim against Mr Cooke for hearing at a later date, and declared (on
Mrs Cooke's counterclaim in the action) that she had a beneficial
interest in the property amounting to 6.47%. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para24">From that Order Mrs Cooke now appeals to this
court, contending that the judge, having correctly found that she had a
beneficial interest, adopted the wrong approach to its quantification;
and the Bank cross-appeals, contending that the judge ought to have
held that Mrs Cooke had no beneficial interest at all. There is no
cross-appeal by the Bank against the finding of undue influence in
respect of the consent form. Mr Cooke has played no part in the appeal.
</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para25">In a clear and able argument, Mr Bergin, for the Bank, contends that: </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para25">(1)The evidence did not establish that the
contribution made by Mr Cooke's parents to the original purchase price
of the property included any element of gift to Mrs Cooke: it was a
present to their son alone (this is the basis for the cross-appeal).</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para25">(2)If that be wrong, and the parents' contribution
is to be regarded as a gift to the spouses jointly, it is conceded that
Mrs Cooke would fall on that footing to be treated as a party who has
contributed directly to the purchase price; but her beneficial interest
is restricted, on basic principles of the law of resulting trusts, to
the proportion born by her cash contribution (£550) to the price of the
property (£8500). All her subsequent conduct, in the admitted absence
of any further direct contribution to the purchase price on her part,
is irrelevant, and can have no retrospective effect upon the
quantification of her share. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para25">(3)If (contrary to (2)) subsequent conduct is prima
facie capable of being taken into account as evidence from which the
court could infer an implied agreement between the spouses that the
proportions in which they share beneficial ownership should be
different from the strict proportions resulting from direct
contribution to the purchase price, no such agreed intention can be
inferred in the present case because both spouses have stated on oath
that they neither made nor intended any agreement - and the court
cannot impute an agreement to parties who have expressly stated that
there never was one.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para26">I will deal separately with those submissions.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para27">A<b> WAS THERE A GIFT BY MR COOKE'S PARENTS TO BOTH SPOUSES?</b></a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para28">The judge was in my view (rejecting Mr Bergin's
first submission) fully entitled, on the evidence which I have quoted,
to hold that there was. In a case where the bride's parents were paying
for the wedding and reception and the bridegroom's parents were
providing a contribution to the purchase price of the matrimonial home,
it would not only be sensible to draw the inference that the
bridegroom's parents intended to make a present to them both of the
monies which were to be applied in the purchase, but highly artificial
to draw any other inference. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para29">In contending that it is, Mr Bergin submits that:</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para29">(a) it is now well settled that in determining (in
the absence of evidence of express agreement) whether a party unnamed
in the deeds has any beneficial interest in the property at all the
test is the stringent one stated by Lord Bridge of Harwich in <u>Lloyds Bank v Rosset</u> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/14.html">1991 1 AC 107</a> at 133:</a></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para29">"In this situation direct
contributions to the purchase price by the partner who is not the legal
owner, whether initially or by payment of mortgage instalments, will
readily justify the inference necessary to the creation of a
constructive trust. But, as I read the authorities, it is at least
extremely doubtful whether anything less will do".</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para29">(b) by parity of reasoning, in cases where a direct
contribution has been duly proved by the partner who is not the legal
owner (thus establishing a resulting trust in his or her favour of <u>some</u>
part of the beneficial interest) the proportion of that share will be
fixed at the proportion it bears to the overall price of the property.
Although the proportion may be enlarged by subsequent contribution to
the purchase price, such contributions must be direct - i.e. further
cash payments or contribution to the capital element in instalment
repayments of any mortgage under which the unpaid proportion of the
purchase remains secured. Nothing less will do.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para30">Mr Bergin derives support for that submission from <u>Springette v Defoe</u>
1992 2 FLR 388. That was a case where cohabitees of mature years bought
in their joint names (so there was no dispute that they both had some
beneficial interest) a council house of which one them had been the
sitting tenant. After crediting the former tenant with the discount in
the purchase price attributable to her rights as a sitting tenant and
taking account of the contributions to that price which each partner
had made in cash, the proportions of their initial contributions stood
at 75% - 25%. Part of the purchase price was provided by a mortgage,
and by express agreement the parties contributed to the mortgage
installments equally. The judge held that the beneficial interests were
equal. He was overruled on appeal, where it was held that the parties
were beneficially entitled in the proportions of 75% to 25%.. Dillon LJ
said (at page 391) in regard to the common intention to be imputed to
the parties, in the absence of express agreement, as to what their
precise shares should be:</a></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para30">"The common intention must be
founded on evidence such as would support a finding that there is an
implied or constructive trust for the parties in proportions to the
purchase price. The court does not as yet sit, as under a palm tree, to
exercise a general discretion to do what the man in the street, on a
general overview of the case, might regard as fair.....</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para30">Since, therefore, it is clear
in the present case that there never was any discussion between the
parties about what their respective beneficial interests were to be,
they cannot, in my judgment, have had in any relevant sense any common
intention as to the beneficial ownership of the property......The
presumption of resulting trust is not displaced."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para31">That decision has to be compared with <u>McHardy and Sons v Warren</u>
[1994] 2 FLR 338, a case in which (as here) it became necessary to
quantify the interests of husband and wife on a strict equitable basis
because of third party claims against the property. The purchase of the
first matrimonial home was (again as in this case) partly financed by a
contribution from the husband's parents, but with the difference that
in that instance the husband's parents paid the whole of the deposit
(using that term in the sense of the net purchase price not covered by
a mortgage) for the property, which was registered in the husband's
sole name. The two subsequent homes successively purchased by the
parties out of the net proceeds of sale of the former home were
similarly taken in his name alone. The husband then executed a charge
on the current home to secure his indebtedness to the plaintiffs who
were trade creditors. In proceedings by the plaintiffs against both
husband and wife to enforce their charge, the plaintiffs asserted that
the wife either had no beneficial interest or at most an interest
equivalent to 8.97% representing the proportion that half the initial
deposit of £650 bore to the total purchase price of the first home. The
judge rejected that claim, holding that the parties were beneficially
entitled in equal shares. He was upheld on appeal. It does not appear
from the law report that <u>Springette v Defoe</u> was cited, but the presiding Lord Justice was again Dillon LJ who said (at p 340):</a></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para31">"To my mind it is the
irresistible conclusion that where a parent pays the deposit, either
directly or to the solicitors or to the bride and groom, it matters not
which, on the purchase of their first matrimonial home, it is the
intention of all three of them that the bride and groom should have
equal interests in the matrimonial home, not interests measured by
reference to the percentage half the deposit [bears] to the full price."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para32">I confess that I find the differences of approach
in those two cases mystifying. In the one a strict resulting trust
geared to mathematical calculation of the proportion of the purchase
price provided by cash contribution is treated as virtually immutable
in the absence of express agreement: in the other a displacement of the
cash-related trust by inferred agreement is not only permitted but
treated as obligatory. Guidance out of this difficulty is to be found,
fortunately, in the passage in the speech of Lord Diplock in <u>Gissing v Gissing</u>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/3.html">[1971] AC 886</a> where he is dealing (at page 908) with the approach to be
adopted by the court when evaluating the proportionate shares of the
parties, once it has been duly established through the direct
contributions of the party without legal title, that <u>some</u> beneficial interest was intended for both. He said:</a></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para32">"Where in any of the
circumstances described above contributions, direct or indirect, have
been made to the mortgage instalments by the spouse into whose name the
matrimonial home has not been conveyed, and the court can infer from
their conduct a common intention that the contributing spouse should be
entitled to some beneficial interest in the matrimonial home, what
effect is to be given to that intention if there is no evidence that
they in fact reached any express agreement as to what the respective
share of each spouse should be?</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para32">I take it to be clear that if
the court is satisfied that it was the common intention of both spouses
that the contributing wife should have a share in the beneficial
interest and that her contributions were made upon this understanding,
the court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction would not
permit the husband in whom the legal estate was vested and who had
accepted the benefit of the contributions to take the whole beneficial
interest merely because at the time the wife made her contributions
there had been no express agreement as to how her share in it was to be
quantified.</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para32">In such a case the court must
first do its best to discover from the conduct of the spouses whether
any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the probable common
understanding about the amount of the share of the contributing spouse
upon which each must have acted in doing what each did, even though
that understanding was never expressly stated by one spouse to the
other or even consciously formulated in words by either of them
independently. It is only if no such inference can be drawn that the
court is driven to apply as a rule of law, and not as an inference of
fact, the maxim "equality is equity," and to hold that the beneficial
interest belongs to the spouses in equal shares.</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para32">The same result however may
often be reached as an inference of fact. The instalments of a mortgage
to a building society are generally repayable over a period of many
years. During that period, as both must be aware, the ability of each
spouse to contribute to the instalments out of their separate earning
is likely to alter, particularly in the case of the wife if any
children are born of the marriage. If the contribution of the wife in
the early part of the period of repayment is substantial but is not an
identifiable and uniform proportion of each instalment, because her
contributions are indirect or, if direct, are made irregularly, it may
well be a reasonable inference that their common intention at the time
of acquisition of the matrimonial home was that the beneficial interest
should be held by them in equal shares and that each should contribute
to the cost of its acquisition whatever amounts each could afford in
the varying exigencies of family life to be expected during the period
of repayment. In the social conditions of today this would be a natural
enough common intention of a young couple who were both earning when
the house was acquired but who contemplated having children whose birth
and rearing in their infancy would necessarily affect the future
earning capacity of the wife.</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para32">The relative size of their
respective contributions to the instalments in the early part of the
period of repayment, or later if a subsequent reduction in the wife's
contribution is not to be accounted for by a reduction in her earnings
due to motherhood or some other cause from which the husband benefits
as well, may make it a more probable inference that the wife's share in
the beneficial interest was intended to be in some proportion other
than one-half. And there is nothing inherently improbable in their
acting on the understanding that the wife should be entitled to a share
which was not to be quantified immediately upon the acquisition of the
home but should be left to be determined when the mortgage was repaid
or the property disposed of, on the basis of what would be fair having
regard to the total contributions, direct or indirect, which each
spouse had made by that date. Where this was the most likely inference
from their conduct it would be for the court to give effect to that
common intention of the parties by determining what in all the
circumstances was a fair share.</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para32">Difficult as they are to
solve, however, these problems as to the amount of the share of a
spouse in the beneficial interest in a matrimonial home where the legal
estate is vested solely in the other spouse, only arise in cases where
the court is satisfied by the words or conduct of the parties that it
was their common intention that the beneficial interest was not to
belong solely to the spouse in whom the legal estate was vested but was
to be shared between them in some proportion or other."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para33">The decision of this court in <u>Grant v Edwards</u>
[1986] 1 Ch 638) also affords helpful guidance. The context was
different, in that the court was there dealing with a legal owner who
has made representations to the occupier on which the latter has relied
to her detriment so as to introduce equities in the nature of estoppel.
Once a beneficial interest had been established by that route, however,
the court then proceeded - as I read the judgments - to fix the
proportions of the beneficial interests on general grounds which were
regarded as applying in all cases. That appears from the judgments of
Nourse LJ at p 650 and of Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C at p 657,
where (after citing the passage I have quoted from Lord Diplock in
Gissing) he says at G:</a></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para33">"Where, as in this case, the
existence of some beneficial interest in the claimant has been shown,
prima facie the interest of the claimant will be that which the parties
intended: <b>Gissing v. Gissing</b> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/3.html">[1971] AC 886</a>, 908G. In <b>Eves v. Eves</b> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../1975/3.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/3.html">[1975] 1 WLR 1338</a></a>,
1345G Brightman L.J. plainly felt that a common intention that there
should be a joint interest pointed to the beneficial interests being
equal. However, he felt able to find a lesser beneficial interest in
that case without explaining the legal basis on which he did so. With
diffidence, I suggest that the law of proprietary estoppel may again
provide useful guidance. If proprietary estoppel is established, the
court gives effect to it by giving effect to the common intention so
far as may fairly be done between the parties. For that purpose, equity
is displayed at its most flexible: see <b>Crabb v. Arun District Council</b>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/7.html">[1976] Ch 179</a>. Identifiable contributions to the purchase of the house
will of course be an important factor in many cases. But in other
cases, contributions by way of the labour or other unquantifiable
actions of the claimant will also be relevant. Taking into account the
fact that the house was intended to be the joint property, the
contributions to the common expenditure and the payment of the fire
insurance moneys into the joint account, I agree that the plaintiff is
entitled to a half interest in the house."</blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para34">The general principle to be derived from <u>Gissing v Gissing</u> and <u>Grant v Edwards</u>
can in my judgment be summarised in this way. When the court is
proceeding, in cases like the present where the partner without legal
title has successfully asserted an equitable interest through direct
contribution, to determine (in the absence of express evidence of
intention) what proportions the parties must be assumed to have
intended for their beneficial ownership, the duty of the judge is to
undertake a survey of the whole course of dealing between the parties
relevant to their ownership and occupation of the property and their
sharing of its burdens and advantages. That scrutiny will not confine
itself to the limited range of acts of direct contribution of the sort
that are needed to found a beneficial interest in the first place. It
will take into consideration all conduct which throws light on the
question what shares were intended. Only if that search proves
inconclusive does the court fall back on the maxim that "equality is
equity".</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para35">My answer to Question "B" would therefore be "No".
The court is not bound to deal with the matter on the strict basis of
the trust resulting from the cash contribution to the purchase price,
and is free to attribute to the parties an intention to share the
beneficial interest in some different proportions. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para36">Mr Bergin submits, however, that in the particular
circumstances of this case, that is an approach which the court is
precluded from following by the evidence of actual intention given by
the spouses themselves. That brings me to his last submission. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para37">C<b>CAN AN AGREEMENT BE ATTRIBUTED BY INFERENCE OF LAW TO PARTIES WHO HAVE EXPRESSLY STATED THAT THEY REACHED NO AGREEMENT?</b></a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para38">Mr Bergin begins by pointing out (rightly) that
this is an area of the law in which there is no scope for discretion.
The entire jurisdiction rests upon the very limited exception provided
by Parliament to the general requirement in S 53 of the Law of Property
Act 1925 that trusts must be evidenced in writing. It is an exception
in favour of trusts that are "resulting, implied or constructive". Mr
Bergin then submits that the resulting trust is that which results from
a contribution to the purchase price, and prima facie that fixes the
proportion of the beneficial interest. Any implied or constructive
trust relied on to alter or enlarge that prima facie entitlement must
rest upon an imputed agreement inferred from conduct by equity. If the
parties themselves testify on oath that they made no agreement, there
is no scope for equity to make one for them.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para39">That is a submission which, if it fell to be
considered without assistance from authority, I would reject
instinctively on the ground that it runs counter to the very system of
law - equity - on which it seeks to rely. Equity has traditionally been
a system which matches established principle to the demands of social
change. The mass diffusion of home ownership has been one of the most
striking social changes of our own time. The present case is typical of
hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of others. When people, especially
young people, agree to share their lives in joint homes they do so on a
basis of mutual trust and in the expectation that their relationship
will endure. Despite the efforts that have been made by many
responsible bodies to counsel prospective cohabitants as to the risks
of taking shared interests in property without legal advice, it is
unrealistic to expect that advice to be followed on a universal scale.
For a couple embarking on a serious relationship, discussion of the
terms to apply at parting is almost a contradiction of the shared hopes
that have brought them together. There will inevitably be numerous
couples, married or unmarried, who have no discussion about ownership
and who, perhaps advisedly, make no agreement about it. It would be
anomalous, against that background, to create a range of home-buyers
who were beyond the pale of equity's assistance in formulating a fair
presumed basis for the sharing of beneficial title, simply because they
had been honest enough to admit that they never gave ownership a
thought or reached any agreement about it.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para40">Mr Bergin submits, however, that his proposition is
supported by authority. He relies upon the passage already quoted from
the judgment of Dillon LJ in <u>Springette v Defoe</u>. He also relies
on the judgment in the same case of Steyne LJ, who quoted the finding
of the trial judge in that case that "It is my judgment that there is
sufficient evidence, on the facts, of inference of common intention or
arrangement between the parties that the property should be owned in
equal shares", and then commented as follows at page 395:</a></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><a name="para40">"But these factors could not
support such an inference because the assistant recorder had already
found as a matter of fact that no such common intention was
communicated between the parties. The simple answer to the man's case
is that there was no communicated common intention. Given that no
actual intention to share the property in equal shares was established,
one is driven back to the equitable principle that the shares are
presumed to be in proportion to the contributions."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para41">These observations of Dillon and Steyne LJJ (with
which Sir Christopher Slade agreed) are of course entitled to the
highest respect, and if they formed part of the ratio of the decision
would be binding on us. But they are observations which need to be read
in the context of a decision relating to the part pooling of resources
by a middle aged couple already established in life whose house-
purchasing arrangements were clearly regarded by the court as having
the same formality as if they had been the subject of a joint venture
or commercial partnership. I cannot for my part believe that it was
intended in that case to lay down a principle, applicable to all
instances, that absence of express agreement precludes inference of
presumed agreement. This impression is confirmed by the subsequent
participation of Dillon LJ in the decision in <u>McHardy's</u> case.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para42">I would therefore hold that positive evidence that
the parties neither discussed nor intended any agreement as to the
proportions of their beneficial interest does not preclude the court,
on general equitable principles, from inferring one. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para42"><b>CONCLUSION</b></a></p>

<p><a name="para43">It follows from the answers I have given to the
last two questions that the judge was in my view in error when he
proceeded to treat the cash contribution to the purchase price as
wholly determinative of the issue of the current proportions of
beneficial entitlement, without regard to the other factors emerging
from the whole course of dealing between the husband and wife. That was
an error of principle, which entitles this court to intervene and reach
our own conclusion as to how the proportions of beneficial interest
should be assessed.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para44">When the proper approach (that is to say the
approach I have summarised in dealing with Question "B") is applied to
the present case, I have little doubt as to what the answer should be.
Mrs Cooke is a wife who in addition to bringing up three children (one
of whom is still only 11) was working full or part time as a teacher
and paying out her earnings in relief of household bills. When a second
charge was taken out on the property within a few months after the
marriage, she undertook joint and several liability to repay it. When
her husband wanted her to sign the consent form in respect of the
mortgage to the Bank for the benefit of his business, she did so,
despite the anxiety and distress which provided part of the grounds for
the judge's ruling that it had been obtained by undue influence.
Thereafter she again undertook liability under a second charge on the
property for the benefit of his business. One could hardly have a
clearer example of a couple who had agreed to share everything equally:
the profits of his business while it prospered, and the risks of
indebtedness suffered through its failure; the upbringing of their
children; the rewards of her own career as a teacher; and, most
relevantly, a home into which he had put his savings and to which she
was to give over the years the benefit of the maintenance and
improvement contribution. When to all that there is added the fact
(still an important one) that this was a couple who had chosen to
introduce into their relationship the additional commitment which
marriage involves, the conclusion becomes inescapable that their
presumed intention was to share the beneficial interest in the property
in equal shares. I reach this result without the need to rely on any
equitable maxim as to equality. It is reinforced by the subsequent
terms of their compromise of the Married Womens Property Act
proceedings. </a></p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="para45">For all these reasons I would allow the appeal,
dismiss the cross-appeal, and substitute for the declaration granted by
the judge a declaration that Mrs Cooke has a beneficial one half
interest in the property. </a></p>
