JUSTICE ROCH:  I will ask Mr Justice Wall to give the first judgment.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">MR
JUSTICE WALL:  This is an appeal brought with the leave of Thorpe LJ on the
papers from an order made by His Honour Judge Curran, sitting in the Cardiff
County Court, on 25th July 1997.  The case concerns a little girl called SH,
born on 1st January 1991 and so just seven years old.  The judge had before him
the father's application for definition of contact, and, for reasons which will
appear as this judgment progresses, the order he made was that the father of
the child, JH, should have direct contact with her each Saturday from ten in
the morning until 12 noon at the 4C's Contact Centre in Cardiff, and in
addition he should have indirect contact with her by way of cards, letters and
presents.  That situation I have just mentioned, contact at the contact centre,
had been going on for some time, and the issue before the judge was a narrow
one, namely:  should contact be moved from the 4C's Contact Centre to the
address in Cardiff where the father was living, which had in fact been the
matrimonial home, to which the father had returned after paying the mother a
lump sum which enabled her to purchase alternative accommodation also, as I
understand it, in the near vicinity.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">At
first blush, therefore, it is somewhat surprising that so narrow an issue
should reach the judge, let alone the Court of Appeal, but to understand why it
has, it is necessary to look at the facts.  I take them from the excellent
chronology and skeleton argument prepared in this appeal by Miss Morris on the
father's behalf.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">S
is a mixed-race child.  Her father is Tunisian and her mother is English.  The
parties met whilst the mother was on holiday in Tunisia in February 1989, and,
following the start of their relationship, the father came to Wales with her at
the end of that year and they were married on 20th April 1990.  It transpires
that the marriage may, depending on what view of the law one takes, have been
bigamous.  The father was prosecuted in the local magistrates court for bigamy,
but we have been told that on appeal, by way of case stated to the Divisional
Court, the conviction was quashed.  The relevance of that is only, in my
judgment, that if he had been convicted there was at least the possibility of
the Home Office reinvestigating his situation, notwithstanding he now has
British citizenship.  In the event it is accepted on all sides that there is no
question of the Home Office seeking to review his status in this country and it
is his case that he intends to remain here permanently.  He obtained British
citizen in 1993.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately
the marriage between the parties was not successful.  The father left the
matrimonial home, which is in Cardiff, and the mother remained there with S.
It has never been in issue that the mother should not look after S.  She has at
all times remained with the mother and the father takes no steps to seek to
vary the residence order subsequently obtained by her.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
father took divorce proceedings and there has, as I understand it, been a
decree.  As I indicated earlier, the father has returned to live in the
matrimonial home.  That took place in early December 1995.  The mother lives
about 400 yards away in a property she has purchased.  Up until January 1996,
again by agreement, the father had regular unrestricted contact with S.  The
arrangement was that he would care for her during the day whilst the mother was
at work.  There is in the papers some dispute between the parties as to how
successful that arrangement was, how regular the father was, how regular the
mother was.  That is not material to this appeal.  There was also an argument
about money.  The father was unemployed for a time and did not pay the
maintenance for S.  Again that, in my judgment, is immaterial to this appeal.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">On
22nd January 1996 there was a most unfortunate incident at the matrimonial
home.  The father had been having contact.  The agreement was that S would be
returned by 5 o'clock.  The father was late.  The mother telephoned the father
to enquire what the reason was.  She was unhappy with his answer and she went
to his house at about 6 o'clock.  There was an argument, and it is alleged that
the father said to her: "I will make sure you don't see her again", referring
to S.  The father denies making that remark and alleges that it was the mother
who behaved in a threatening manner.  Indeed the mother accepts that during the
course of the argument she smashed a pane or panes of glass in the front door
of the father's property.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Most
unfortunately that incident has never been the subject of judicial finding.  I
will return to that point later in this judgment.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Following
the incident I have just described, the mother terminated contact and applied
to the Cardiff County Court on 23rd January 1996 for a residence order and a
prohibited steps order.  On the following day she was granted an ex parte
interim residence order and a prohibited steps order preventing the father from
removing S from the jurisdiction.  On 12th March the father undertook to
surrender his passport to the court.  On that basis it was ordered by consent
that there should be a residence order in favour of the mother; the father was
prohibited from removing S from the jurisdiction, and, in order to re-establish
contact, he was to have contact with S on 16th March from 3.00 pm to 4.00 pm,
and thereafter from 10.30 am to 1.00 am every Saturday.  A court welfare
officer's report was ordered on the issue of contact; and the matter was
adjourned to 27th June for further consideration.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">On
that day the matter came before the court with the benefit of the court welfare
officer's report dated 12th June.  The author had observed a session of contact
between the father and S and reported that there was an affectionate bond
between the two of them.  That, I think, is not in dispute.  It is accepted by
the mother that the father is very fond of the little girl and that she is fond
of him.  However, by this time there had arisen in the mother what the court
welfare officer called "an immovable fear" on her part that S would be abducted
by her father, and in these circumstances the mother argued that contact could
only go on if it was at a contact centre.  The welfare officer was of the view
that the father's contact needed sorting out and defining and that the
arrangement had to be progressive; in other words the matter must move on.
Contact could not go on indefinitely in the contact centre.  She concluded: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"It
may not be unreasonable in time for Mr H to be allowed to take S from the
centre into the town."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">At
the hearing on 27th June a change in the mother's working arrangements was
discovered.  She was no longer able to take S to the contact centre on Saturday
mornings, so for a time contact took place at the Weston Leisure Centre in
Cardiff.  Contact was to be from 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm each Sunday.  That
arrangement was not entirely successful for reasons which I need not go into.
The father says the mother ceased to comply with the order, and on 27th
November he re-applied for contact to be reviewed.  The mother responded by
applying to terminate contact, and on 23rd December the matter came before the
court.  Contact was ordered by consent from Saturday, 11th January 1997 from
10.00 am to 12.00 noon each Saturday at the contact centre, and a further
welfare officer's report was ordered for a review in March.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">On
17th March the court welfare officer reported that mother's concern that S
would be abducted appeared to have intensified, and, given the lack of trust
between the parties, the welfare officer took the view that the contact centre
was the most appropriate venue.  In those circumstances it was ordered by
agreement that the previous order for contact should continue and that the
court welfare service should provide a further report on the issue of contact
and the father's application for what amounted to unsupervised contact was
adjourned to 25th July.  This was the hearing which came before Judge Curran
and which is the subject of the instant appeal.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">As
I already indicated, the father was applying for what I think is genuinely
described as a modest variation of the contact order.  He found the situation
of the contact centre somewhat repressive. There were limited facilities, and
inevitably a limitation to what he could do with S in that environment.  He
said that he wanted to take S to the former matrimonial home for identical
hours, 10:00 to 12:00 each Saturday.  He invited the mother to come into the
house  whilst he was exercising contact, or, alternatively, she could sit
outside in a motorcar to ensure that no attempt was made for S to be removed.
The mother opposed the application and sought to maintain the order that S have
contact with her father at the contact centre.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">There
was, I think, what is by now the fourth court welfare officer's report before
the court.  The officer reported that the mother's fears of abduction remained
constant and that S had picked up on her mother's anxieties.  When asked
directly by the court welfare officer about that, the little girl stated that
she did not like it when her mother was not there because her father might
"pinch" her.  She also stated:  "If he takes me to the zoo it is a long way.  I
would fall asleep and wake up in Tunisia."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
welfare officer reported that the mother has been prescribed medication for
depression and stress and had regular counselling sessions with her health
visitor.  There was produced to the court a letter from the health visitor and
the general practitioner, which I think is of some relevance and which I
propose to read.  It is dated 6th May 1997 and is addressed to the court
welfare officers.  It says: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"We
wish to express our serious concerns about our patient and the adverse
indications for her 6 year-old daughter's well-being if the matter of parental
access for her ex-husband is not resolved soon.  It is clearly not in the
interests of mother and daughter - nor the intention of the Court - to
otherwise subject them to long term and continuous pressure.  [The mother]
feels that unsupervised contact between her daughter and former husband is
unsafe.  She tells us he has violently threatened her, barely over a year ago,
with never seeing her daughter again.  On this occasion he banged [the
mother's] head repeatedly against a wall in front of their daughter (then 5 yrs
old) - this was apparently in keeping with Mr H's violent and intimidating
behaviour towards his 2nd wife (WT) during their 4 yrs of marriage."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Once
again, that allegation against the father, if made, has never been the subject
of judicial interpretation or finding.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
letter continues: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Judge
Graham Jones stated in court on 2 separate occasions that unsupervised access
was untenable.  W feels nothing has changed and that safe and appropriate
paternal access can only be provided at the 4Cs until her daughter is a
teenager.  We are aware that the Court has done its best to safeguard S's
interests by issuing various Orders but this has not put our patient's mind at
rest.  Past history of similar cases does reveal serious pitfalls and we are
sure [the mother's] fears are not unreasonable.  
	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		To
add to [the mother's] difficulties, she has sustained a back injury due to a
fall at work - this has been serious enough to force her to give up her job and
will clearly take some time to heal properly.  This and the worry of the
repeated returns to the Court is placing her (as it would anyone) under
enormous strain.  She is an excellent and conscientious parent and it is not
conducive to her or her daughter's welfare that she is being pushed to the
limit by this situation.  A long-term, safe resolution is urgently required for
the best interest of the mother and the daughter."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Whilst
I have to say I find that letter somewhat tendentious in tone and it is not, in
my judgment, the function of doctors or court welfare officers to express a
view about whether or not an incident has occurred, it nonetheless raises a
serious issue which must be in the mind of the court when deciding what contact
to award.  Clearly the mother's fears as to abduction are genuine, as the judge
found, and are strong, again as the judge found.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
the final court welfare officer's report dated 9th July 1997, the welfare
officer comments that S has undoubtedly and inevitably picked up her mother's
anxieties.  The welfare officer described SH nonetheless in other respects as: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"...
a happy, well adjusted child, accepting the routine of weekly contact with her
father but with an underlying awareness that it might not be safe for her to be
separated from her mother."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">That
underlying awareness clearly stems from her mother's anxieties.  The welfare
officer comments that: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"[The
father] appears to have co-operated with the Orders of the Court, surrendering
his passport and prioritising his weekly contact with S.  He feels the
constraints of the Centre and would like to spend more time with his daughter
through [different] outings and activities." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
final paragraph of the report is, in my judgment, of some considerable
importance.  It reads as follows: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
Court's decision will undoubtedly be reached having heard the full evidence,
and on the basis of S's overall welfare which overrides all other
considerations.  In my view, S's needs for contact with her father is currently
being met.  There may be a possibility of emotional harm to the child should
the mother feel subjected to ongoing anxiety and fear for her child's long term
security and safety.  As I said in my previous report, unless a measure of
trust develops between the parents contact will continue to be strained.
Sadly, the possibility of any trust developing appears to be diminishing rather
than growing."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
judge heard evidence from both parties.  We have of course a transcript of his
judgment.  He was clearly anxious to be as sympathetic as possible to both
sides and he made fair assessments of their respective positions.  He related
the history which I have already set out and do not propose to repeat.  He
accepted the court welfare officer's evidence that S's primary bond of love and
affection was with her mother and that this was so was recognised by her
father.  He also said that the child had a right to contact with her father and
that it was conceded by the mother that the child enjoyed her contact visits,
that she loved her father and had a bond of affection with him which was
reciprocated.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">So
much is common ground.  He goes on in these terms: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
root of the problem that exists in this case is that although in the majority
of instances after a period of supervised contact the court would hope and
expect in the interests of the child that the situation would move on, as it
were, and that unsupervised contact could be restored, there is still that
issue between the parties.  Father now seeks contact at what was the former
matrimonial home during the same hours on a Saturday morning.  Mother contends
that because she is afraid father would remove the child from the jurisdiction
if he had the opportunity of doing so and if the mood took him, contact should
remain on the neutral ground of the contact centre where she fees a sense of
security and safety and does not feel threatened by any suggestion that the
child would be removed from her care.  That is what I have to resolve in this
case.  The principle of their being direct contact between the father and
daughter is not in dispute.  The question is, where, in the interests of the
child, that should be from now on."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">So
far, if I may respectfully say so, so good.  That is, in my view, a sensitive
and concise assessment of the position.  The judge said that he was not going
to spell out the full welfare checklist under s 1</A>(3)(e) of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act</A></A>
<A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">1989</A></A>.  I agree with him that it is not necessary for a judge to do so, provided
that, in the body of his judgment overall, it can be shown that he has had the
relevant factors in mind.  In this case the judge went through a number of
them, so he clearly did.  He then referred to the letter from the general
practitioner and the health visitor, which I have read, and commented in these
terms: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"What
is also clear from the letter which has been produced to the court attached to
the court welfare officer's report, from the doctor and health visitor, is that
mother has been under a considerable degree of stress and strain as a result of
her fears that the child might be removed from the jurisdiction."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Then
follows the crucial part of the judgment: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"What
I am here to decide is, not whether this father does actually intend to remove
the child from the jurisdiction.  That is not really the central point in this
application.  The question is, is there a genuine fear by the mother that he
would do so if had the opportunity?" 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Having
asked that question, the judge finds that the mother does have a genuine fear
of abduction, a fear which has been gnawing away at her, as it were, and that
it has caused her a great deal of distress and unhappiness which has been
undoubtedly communicated to the child.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
judge went on: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Those
are the circumstances in which I have to consider the application for contact.
This is not a case now where I propose to make an order for contact, with a
view to it coming back before the court in another three or four months with a
view to further review and a further report from the welfare officer.  It seems
to me that, one way or another, a contact order has to be made today which the
parties can regard as a permanent order, in so far as any order on such a topic
is regarded as permanent, because obviously parties have a right to come back
before the court and made a fresh application."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">He
therefore decided that the status quo should remain and that contact should
continue to take place at the contact centre.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Ground
1 of the notice of appeal settled by Miss Morris is in these terms: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
Learned Judge was plainly wrong when he stated that the test was not whether or
not the Appellant intended to abduct the child, S, but whether or not the
Respondent believed that such a threat existed.  It was incumbent upon the
Learned Judge to assess the risk of abduction in order to assess whether the
Respondent's fears about unsupervised contact were justified."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
second ground is: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
learned judge was plainly wrong when he failed to make any findings of fact in
relation to the incident between the parties on 22nd January 1996, in
particular, as to whether or not the Appellant threatened to abduct the child
S, as alleged by the Respondent and/or failed to assess the risk of such
abduction."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
my judgment those two grounds of appeal are made out.  The critical issue in
this case was this:  was the father likely to abduct the child?  The judge saw
him and had a great deal of evidence about him, and he saw the mother.  Both
were examined and cross-examined.  There was substantial material put forward
on the father's behalf to establish that he was fully integrated into English
society, apart from the fact that he referred to Tunisia from time to time as
home.  He had a good job here, he had a house here, and so on.  In my judgment,
the judge should have grasped the two nettles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of
the notice of appeal.  The critical question in the case was:  is there a
substantial risk that this father will abduct this child?  However, that risk
could only be properly assessed on the basis of findings of fact made by the
judge, critical amongst which were the two questions:  what happened on 22nd
January?  In particular, did the father threaten the mother that she would
never see the child again?
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">That
this is the correct approach is made clear by 
<U>Re
M and R (Minors) (Sexual Abuse:  Expert Evidence

<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/16.html">[1996] AC 563</a> that the assessment of the likelihood of significant harm in care
proceedings had to be based on findings of fact made on the balance of
probabilities.  Thus the assessment of a given risk to a child in private law
proceedings must be based on findings of fact.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">There
are of course cases in which a judge takes the view that investigation of a
particular issue is likely to cause more distress than the probative value of
any findings on that issue.  In such circumstances a judge may well say that he
is not going to investigate or that he is not proposing to make findings of
fact; but where a particular issue is critical to the exercise of his
discretion, as was the case here, in my judgment the judge has a plain duty to
make findings of fact.  As 
<U>Re
M and R
</U>
(supra) shows, he cannot assess risk unless he has made findings of fact.  It
was of critical importance to the exercise of his discretion to know, firstly,
whether or not the father had threatened the mother in the way she suggests and
whether or not there was a likelihood of the father abducting the child.  In my
judgment, therefore, this failure to make these necessary findings of fact
vitiates the exercise of the judge's discretion and it is therefore open to
this court to substitute its own view.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">A
variety of possibilities are open.  We could send the matter back to the judge
for re-hearing and for him to make the findings of fact which we believe to be
necessary.  That is one option.  Against it is the fact that litigation clearly
causes this family substantial stress.  The letter from the doctor makes it
quite clear that the mother is under stress and that court proceedings
exacerbate that stress.  I am also conscious of the fact that further court
proceedings are likely to be adversarial, however skilfully conducted and
however moderate the tone.  So the idea of an immediate further trial on issues
of fact when the same incidents have to be gone over again is, on its face,
unattractive.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Secondly,
we could substitute our own view, but the difficulty about that, in my
judgment, is that we are of course wholly unable to assess the father's
credibility.  This court is wholly unable to decide what did happen on 22nd
January.  We have not heard the witnesses and we have not, in particular, heard
the mother and the father's accounts of the relevant incidents alleged.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">There
is therefore a considerable difficulty, and I have not myself found the
resolution of it easy.  One resolution which greatly appeals to me, given the
very strong amount of common ground that there is in this case, is that the
parties should attend mediation.  A skilled mediator who would have had no
contact with the case (not, therefore, the court welfare officer) could, I
think, discuss this matter with the parties and build on the common ground
which undoubtedly exists between them.  There needs to be a mechanism to reduce
the mother's anxiety, assuming for this purpose that the father's 
<I>bona
fides 
</I>are
established.  But that is a matter for the parties.  I cannot compel them to
mediation and indeed compulsory mediation is a contradiction in terms.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
these circumstances I have come to the conclusion, speaking for myself, that I
do not think we can properly substitute our own order for that made by the
judge.  I have to say that on what we have heard today it seems to me highly
likely that it is in the interests of this little girl for contact to move on.
The father has had ample opportunity to abduct her if he had wanted to.  The
parties live 400 yards apart.  We are told that the contact centre has
entrances and exists not all of which have been manned during the contact, and,
speaking for myself, I can see little reason why, with suitable safeguards,
contact should not take place in the matrimonial home, with the mother, if she
does not wish to enter the premises, sitting outside in her car and possibly,
if she really feels it necessary, for someone else to be sitting outside the
back door.  But that again seems to me a matter which is not within the
province of this court, however desirable it may be to move the matter on.  I
cannot make that order, in my judgment, because I am not the trial judge and in
the Court of Appeal we lack the vital findings which would make it appropriate.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">So
what do we do?  I have come to the conclusion that the only way forward here,
in the exceptional circumstances of this case (and in my judgment they are
exceptional), and accepting that the mother's fear, which may be unfounded, is
nonetheless genuine, is to make a family assistance order made under <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s16.html">section 16</A>
of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A></A>.  That order has to be made by consent, and I am
grateful to both the mother and the father for giving their agreement to that
order being made this afternoon.  The order under <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s16.html">section 16</A> requires either a
probation officer to become available or the local authority to make an officer
of the authority available to advise, assist and, where appropriate, befriend
any person named in the order, and the people named in the order will of course
be the parents and the child.  We cannot make such an order unless the court is
satisfied that the circumstances of the case are exceptional (and I am
satisfied that this is an exceptional case) and that the parties consent, which
they do.  The local authority is bound to accept an order provided the child
concerned lives or will live within their area, and so that condition is
fulfilled as well.  Whilst I am acutely aware of the financial constraints on
local authorities in their social services budget, I hope very much that this
authority will be able to make an officer available.  Speaking for myself, I
would propose to direct that that officer should have access to the court
papers, which should be released to him or her, and that that officer should
also see a copy of the judgments of this court. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
family assistance orders lasts for six months, unless renewed, and I would
leave the matter there.  Clearly if progress has not been made during the six
months of the family assistance order, it may well be necessary for the father
to apply to the court further to define contact, and if that occurs I
anticipate and hope that any tribunal dealing with the matter would make the
necessary findings of fact as to his 
<I>bona
fides.  
</I>This
father needs to know where he stands.  At the moment he stands in
no-man's-land; he does not know what the court thinks of him and he is entitled
to have that finding.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">This
is a difficult and sensitive case and, in my judgment, litigation often
polarises when it should bring together, particularly where contact is
concerned.  Both parents are in court and they have heard me say that there is
here a very substantial measure of common ground.  Both parties love their
child; the child loves both of them.  The principle of contact is not in issue.
SH is a child of mixed race.  It is very important for SH that in due course
she should have the opportunity to get to know and fully to understand and
appreciate the Tunisian side of her heritage.  The mother's fear of abduction,
however, needs to be overcome if contact is to move smoothly forward, and if
the parties do not choose to go to mediation it seems to me, speaking for
myself, that the best way forward is that which I propose, namely a family
assistance order, followed by an application to the court by the father to vary
the order, if need be.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">I
would therefore leave the order in place, albeit that I am disagreeing with the
reasons of the judge for reaching it.  It is of course open to the father to go
back at any time, but I hope he will take the view that he has a whole lifetime
to enjoy his daughter's company and to get to know her.  There will come a
time, whatever the mother's anxieties, even if they are not resolved, when this
little girl will be of an age to come and see him and go out with him and to be
part of his life, unrestricted by court orders or injunctions.  He has to
demonstrate to the mother, as I am bound to say on the papers his conduct
appears to me to indicate so far, that he is genuine in his wish for contact
and genuine in his expression of protestation against the allegation that he is
going to remove the child from the mother's care and the country.  So I urge
him not to rush back to court.  I urge him to give the family assistance order
a chance.  Equally, I urge the mother to search her mind and conscience very
carefully to see whether she can see her way to moving the matter forward in
the interests of this little girl.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">For
these reasons, although I am disagreeing with the reasoning of the circuit
judge, I would dismiss this appeal but direct there be a family assistance
order, directed to the Cardiff City Council, for a period of six months.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">LORD
JUSTICE ROCH:  I agree.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		ORDER:
 Appeal dismissed; family assistance order naming the father, mother and child;
no order for costs; legal aid taxation.
