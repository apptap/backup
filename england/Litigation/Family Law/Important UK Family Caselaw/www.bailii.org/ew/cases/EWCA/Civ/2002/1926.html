  <P>Lord Justice Buxton : </P>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Introduction</I></P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>This appeal from a decision of Elias J concerns the 
  compatibility of section 548(1), as amended, of the Education Act 1996 with 
  various provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights [the 
  Convention]; principally, though not exclusively, article 9(1) of the 
  Convention and article 2 of the First Protocol thereto. Section 548(1) 
  provides that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Corporal punishment given by, or on the authority of a member 
    of staff to a child for whom education is provided at any school….cannot be 
    justified in any proceedings on the ground that it was given in pursuance of 
    a right exercisable by a member of staff by virtue of his position as 
  such."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Similar provisions had existed in earlier legislation. The significant 
  change in those provisions, achieved by an amendment to the Education Act made 
  by section 131 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, was to extend 
  this prohibition even to staff in wholly private schools.</P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>I first give an account, drawn from the evidence 
  before the court, of the beliefs and practices of the appellants, teachers and 
  parents at certain private schools, which they allege are interfered with by 
  section 548 in breach of the Convention. Such an account is necessary, not 
  merely as background to the appeal, but also because the claim to be entitled 
  to the protection of the Convention depends on a precise understanding of what 
  it is that is sought to be protected. Next, I set out the asserted interests 
  of the parents who send their children to the schools, on the one hand; and of 
  the teachers who work in and manage those schools on the other; and describe 
  how those interests are interfered with by section 548 on its normal, domestic 
  law, construction, applied without reference to the Convention. I then set out 
  my conclusions as to whether section 548 does, in the case of either the 
  parents or the teachers, infringe the rights under the Convention that they 
  assert in this case; and give my reasons in support of those conclusions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The appellants' beliefs and their practices</I></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>The appellants are teachers at, and parents who send 
  their children to, a number of independent private schools established 
  specifically to provide Christian education based on biblical observance. It 
  is a feature of the regime administered by the teachers at all of these 
  schools that in appropriate cases discipline will be enforced by the use of 
  corporal punishment, an arrangement to which all of the parents agree. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>It is the appellants' case that the use of corporal 
  punishment is based upon Christian principles, though the nature, and the 
  intensity, of the stated connexion differed between various of the appellants 
  who had offered evidence to the court below. The essence of the appellants' 
  beliefs was however summarised thus in their written submissions to this 
  court: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>It is a central tenet of the Christian religion that mankind is 
    born with a heart inclined to evil; disciplining in the educational context 
    is therefore vital. It is not an 'optional extra', but corporal punishment 
    is expressly sanctioned, approved and may be necessary. Judicial notice can 
    be taken that current views on the approach to educational requirements of 
    children are contrary to orthodox Christian teaching.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>In evidence, Mr Williamson, the headmaster the 
  Christian Fellowship School, Liverpool, and the only deponent before Elias J, 
  said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>All teaching staff, and all parents have made considerable 
    sacrifices to place their children within a Christian education, which has 
    strict observance to the Bible according to their religious beliefs. As part 
    of our beliefs we believe it is an integral part of the teaching and 
    education of children both by their parents, and by teachers, that physical 
    discipline should be administered if and when appropriate. Obviously such 
    punishment must always be within the law, and no person concerned with the 
    case has ever been involved in any criminal offence involving the punishment 
    of children, abuse or otherwise. Unfortunately, when putting these beliefs 
    forward, we are often accused of abusing children which is wholly untrue 
    without foundation and an attack on the exercise of our religious 
  beliefs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>A more detailed account of the perceived 
  justification for the practice was given by Mr KG Jones, the Principal of the 
  Maranatha Christian School, who had given evidence in an earlier application 
  to Strasbourg, which evidence was admitted before Elias J: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The Bible and a 1000 years of British history, that rests on it, 
    provide significantly compelling reasons to use loving corporal correction 
    to train a child. Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is 
    old he will not depart from it [Book of Proverbs, 22.6]. Foolishness is 
    bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it 
    far from him [Proverbs, 22.15]. Do not withhold correction from a child for 
    if you beat him with a rod, he will not die. You shall beat him with a rod 
    and deliver his soul from hell [Proverbs, 23.14]. In sum, it is an essential 
    of the Christian faith that loving corporal correction be utilised in the 
    development of Christian character in my pupils. Further, it is a basic of 
    religious liberty that the parents whom I serve be permitted to delegate to 
    the School the ability to train children according to Biblical 
  principles.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>Reliance was also placed before the judge, and 
  before us, on Proverbs 13.24: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is 
    diligent to discipline him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>It was the general view of the appellants that the 
  justification for, or requirement of, their practices came from those 
  scriptural sources. Thus Mr Williamson, in further evidence to which I shall 
  have to return, said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>A fundamental reason for the child to be sent to a Christian 
    school is for the maintenance of a disciplinary policy in accordance with 
    the Book of Proverbs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In that connexion, I of course accept and respect the observations of Rix 
  and Arden LJJ that the content of a religious belief is not necessarily to be 
  found solely in scriptural sources, but may be developed from those texts by 
  interpretation and insight. But Mr Williamson's evidence would seem to 
  demonstrate that, in this case, the religious obligation to employ corporal 
  punishment that these appellants assert is found by them in the literal 
  wording of the texts that they cite from the Book of Proverbs.</P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>A number of statements were produced from parents 
  explaining their support for the institution of corporal punishment. These 
  varied in content and emphasis, but a consistent theme amongst them was that 
  corporal punishment was "biblical". Many of them also expressed the view that 
  corporal punishment works. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>However, the actual practice in the schools in 
  question is, on the evidence, somewhat different from what might be assumed to 
  follow from these theological positions. Mr Jones explained that his school 
  employed a very wide range of punishments, and that corporal correction was 
  reserved for "some cases of a severe moral offence". The act of physical 
  punishment is done lovingly, after full discussion, and only if the child 
  "volitionally accepts the need for this correction". The infliction is done as 
  correction, not as a punishment, and takes the form of a thin, broad flat 
  paddle administered to both buttocks simultaneously in a firm controlled 
  manner. The appellants were adamant that there was no question of beating in 
  the traditional sense: "smacking" was closer to the mark (see Elias J's report 
  of the submissions before him, at §4 of the judgment). And it was emphasised 
  that nothing was done that fell within the prohibition on degrading treatment 
  or punishment in article 3 of the Convention. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>There was disagreement between the witnesses as to 
  the desirability of punishment incurred for infractions of school discipline 
  being administered not by the teachers but by the childrens' parents. This 
  issue became one of some importance in the context of a particular line of 
  authority in the ECtHR that I address at the end of this judgment. Mr Jones 
  said that in his school the preferred course was for a parent to be invited in 
  to the school to administer the punishment. It was only if that were not 
  possible that the teachers took action, in the manner described in §10 above. 
  However, in their further evidence, filed in relation to the line of authority 
  just referred to, Mr Williamson and a Mr Sammons, the parent of a child at Mr 
  Williamson's school, strongly repudiated any involvement of the parents in the 
  infliction of the disciplinary measures. They took this view primarily because 
  of the delay that would be involved between identification of the offence and 
  the actual infliction of the punishment, a delay that they considered to be 
  contrary to scriptural direction: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, 
    therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil 
    (Ecclesiastes chapter 8 verse 11).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Further, the evidence said that the school wished to follow a consistent, 
  and public, disciplinary policy, which might be disrupted by the involvement 
  of individual parents; and that parents might not be able to attend the school 
  at short notice, and in any event did not wish to suffer the emotional trauma 
  of administering discipline without first-hand knowledge of the incident.</P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>When the court asked for an explanation of this 
  discrepancy, Mr Diamond, counsel for the appellants, said that, as in respect 
  of other beliefs, differing views might be taken as to the extent and detail 
  of the application of the beliefs. What united all of the appellants was the 
  belief that the evil heart of man had to be addressed by physical correction. 
  The actual application of that belief might vary between different adherents: 
  as the evidence in this case indeed demonstrated. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The interests of the parents and of the teachers</I></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>In the present state of English law, it is a 
  defence to what would otherwise be a criminal assault by a parent on his child 
  that the parent was inflicting "reasonable chastisement" on the child. The 
  limits of this parental right or liberty are obscure, as is the point at which 
  such chastisement becomes unacceptable to the extent that a failure on the 
  part of the state to use the criminal law to control the parent engages the 
  state's responsibility under article 3 of the Convention: see <I>A v UK</I> 
  (1998) 27 EHRR 611. This last, and difficult, issue does not, however, arise 
  in our case, since it was accepted that nothing was done to the children by 
  the teachers that, if it had been done by a parent, would have exposed the 
  parent to civil or criminal claims for assault, or would have exposed the 
  state to any liability under article 3. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>But under the regime in issue in the present case, 
  although at least in some schools the punishment may be inflicted by a parent 
  at the instance of the school, where for any reason that does not occur the 
  teachers assert a right not only to adjudicate upon the child's behaviour, but 
  also themselves to administer the corporal punishment in respect of that 
  behaviour. Teachers as a class were, under the common law, protected against 
  charges of assault, provided they inflicted only "reasonable chastisement", by 
  the fact that the parent had delegated or transferred to them responsibility 
  for, and thus power over, the behaviour of the child. I however agree with 
  Elias J, in his analysis in §§ 17-18 of his judgment of <I>Clearly v Booth</I> 
  [1893] 1 QB 465 and <I>Ryan v Fildes</I> [1938] 3 All ER 516, that such 
  delegation was seen as constituted by the general act of sending the child to 
  school, rather than as an <I>ad hoc</I> power conferred in a particular case. 
  That conclusion is supported by the practical reflection that unless the 
  delegation were to teachers in their capacity as such, and to support their 
  general exercise of authority within the school, it would have been necessary 
  for the parent to adjudicate in each case upon whether the particular offence 
  merited punishment at all: a point that is indeed taken, as an argument 
  against parental involvement, in the appellants' evidence referred to in §11 
  above. We can also no doubt take judicial notice of the fact that, when 
  corporal punishment was in general use in English schools, direct involvement 
  of the parents was not the general practice; and it was certainly not the 
  practice in the cases that upheld the teacher's right of correction. As Tucker 
  J put it in <I>Ryan v Fildes</I>: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"when a parent sends his child to school, he delegates to 
    teachers at the school the power to inflict moderate and reasonable corporal 
    punishment in a proper case, and…he delegates to the teacher the taking of 
    such steps as are necessary to maintain discipline with regard to the child 
    committed to the teacher's care."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>It was that exemption or liberty that was removed 
  by section 548, which removes any protection for the teacher asserted "by 
  virtue of his position as such [teacher]". That was precisely the basis of the 
  common law exemption explained in the preceding paragraphs: the teachers were 
  protected under the common law authority there cited because the children had 
  been placed in their care <I>as teachers</I>. With the removal of that 
  exemption, they are exposed to liability for civil and criminal sanctions in 
  just the same way as anyone else who commits an assault. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>If, therefore, section 548 is open to objection on 
  Convention grounds, the teachers have two grounds of complaint. First, they 
  are exposed to sanctions, not only legal sanctions, but also under the regime 
  for the control of education operated by the respondents loss of livelihood, 
  if they continue to inflict corporal punishment on their pupils. Second, they 
  are effectively prevented from running, and offering to the world, an 
  educational regime that includes corporal punishment as part of its scheme of 
  pupil management: an element in the ethos of their schools to which they 
  attach importance. Accordingly, the practical effect of section 548 is, as its 
  cross-note asserts, "abolition of corporal punishment" as part of the school 
  regime. If section 548 is inconsistent with the Convention, the teachers would 
  therefore be victims for the purposes of section 7(7) of the 1998 Act, because 
  section 548 takes away from them the ability to run the schools as they wish. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>What of the parents? They are by the same token 
  deprived of the availability for their children of schools that provide the 
  regime described in the evidence in this case. They would also therefore be 
  "victims" of section 548. Section 548 would not bite upon a specific 
  delegation to a teacher by the parent in a particular case of the parent's 
  power to inflict reasonable chastisement. However, the question of whether, as 
  the judge thought at §26 of his judgment, such a delegation is not in any 
  event possible in English law need not detain us, because the facts of this 
  case, and the regime that both teachers and parents wish to retain, do not 
  support an analysis in terms of specific delegation of that type. The 
  delegation here involved is of the nature described in §14 above. It occurs 
  and is completed by the act of sending the child to a school that offers this 
  particular form of discipline, a regime that is agreed to, in general and 
  comprehensive terms, by the parents before they enter the child. Elias J 
  correctly analysed the factual position in the present case when he said of 
  the parental delegation argument, at §28 of his judgment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It would still be the case that the parent would be expressly 
    delegating the power only because the recipient was a teacher. It is only 
    because of his office that the parent wishes him to be able to impose the 
    sanction. In administering the punishment, the teacher would therefore still 
    be exercising the power by virtue of his position as such. He would, 
    therefore, fall firmly within the terms of [section 548]."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>The relief sought by all of the claimants is a 
  declaration that </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Section 548 of the Education Act 1996 as amended does not 
    prevent a parent delegating to a teacher in an independent school the right 
    to administer physical punishment. A teacher who so administers physical 
    punishment on the basis of an expressed delegation by a parent in writing, 
    does not act unlawfully or unprofessionally"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs, I am clearly of the 
  view that section 548, understood in its primary, domestic, construction does 
  indeed prevent such delegation, at least when the "delegation" is to teachers 
  in schools of the type and with the regime and practices that both the 
  teachers and the parents engaged in this case wish to maintain. We are 
  therefore unavoidably obliged to consider whether that inhibition is lawful in 
  view of the obligations of the United Kingdom under the Convention.</P>
  <P><I>Summary of the conclusions of this judgment</I></P>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>It will be convenient here to summarise my 
  conclusions </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>i) As a general background to consideration of the specific issues in the 
  case, it has to be noted that the evidence of the beliefs and practices of the 
  parents and the teachers reveals a significant degree of unclarity as to the 
  basis upon which corporal punishment is inflicted, and disagreement as to the 
  implementation in practice of the beliefs asserted.</P>
  <P>ii) However, whatever conclusions as to the content and nature of their 
  beliefs may follow from the analysis that is referred to in (i) above, neither 
  the teachers, in inflicting corporal punishment, nor the parents in supporting 
  its infliction within the school, manifest those beliefs in the sense of that 
  expression as it is used in article 9(1) of the Convention. Article 9 is not, 
  therefore, engaged in this case in any event.</P>
  <P>iii) Article 2 of the First Protocol to the Convention is concerned solely 
  with the rights of parents, and therefore the interests of the teachers are 
  not engaged by it. </P>
  <P>iv) The parents are potentially beneficiaries of article 2, but the beliefs 
  expressed and sought to be practised by them in this case do not, for the 
  reasons referred to in (i) above, attain the level of cogency and cohesion 
  that is required if those beliefs are to count as religious and philosophical 
  convictions of the nature that are protected by article 2.</P>
  <P>v) Further, and in any event, the relevant belief can only be analysed as 
  being that corporal punishment should be inflicted for breaches of school 
  discipline. Infliction of such punishment by the parent, rather than by the 
  teacher, would fulfil that belief, and therefore neither the parents nor the 
  teachers can rely on the belief to protect infliction of punishment by the 
  teachers. Such infliction of punishment by the partents would not be impeded 
  by section 548, which is concerned solely with the conduct of the 
teachers.</P>
  <P>vi) Claims that section 548 infringes either article 8 or article 10 of the 
  Convention are without foundation.</P>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal. However, 
  the general importance of some of the issues involved requires me to explain 
  in some detail the reasoning that leads me to that conclusion. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Religious belief as demonstrated by the evidence </I></P>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>Article 9 protects the manifestation of religion 
  or belief. Article 2 of the first protocol protects religious and 
  philosophical convictions in the context of education. Before considering the 
  detailed jurisprudence of those two provisions of the Convention it is 
  necessary to say something more about the nature of the religious beliefs 
  engaged in this case. It is right to record that the appellants strongly 
  criticised any such investigation on the part of the court. In their view, if 
  I understand it correctly, a secular court, faced with an assertion of a 
  religious belief, must take that stated belief at face value, and, except at 
  least in extreme cases, should not seek to adjudicate upon its basis or 
  validity. I have no difficulty, at least in general terms, with the latter 
  contention, and do not seek to pass any judgement upon the appellants' 
  beliefs. But when, as in this case, the court is asked to adjudicate upon 
  whether the practice of a particular belief is interfered with by legislation; 
  and whether that interference is contrary to the requirements of the 
  Convention; it cannot possibly address that question without a clear 
  understanding of what the belief in question is, and how it is followed 
  through in practice. I have already said enough in this judgment to indicate 
  that in this case the answers to those questions are, on the material before 
  the court, far from self-evident. The court must, therefore, look at that 
  material with particular care. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>It would be wrong if I did not say immediately 
  that I am caused considerable difficulty by the gap that is apparent from the 
  evidence set out earlier in this judgment between the actual practice of the 
  appellants and the imperatives of the scriptural authority by which those 
  practices are said to be justified. Nor have I found myself able to explicate 
  those beliefs by reference to more general Christian precepts. The court can 
  only proceed on the evidence before it: indeed, as I have already indicated, 
  the appellants urged very strongly that it is not our role to bring to the 
  case our own understanding of the nature of religious belief. No such wider 
  Christian precepts were explained in evidence, nor were they supported by any 
  biblical authority, either generally or in specific relation to corporal 
  punishment: despite the emphasis in the evidence upon the strict biblical 
  basis of the appellants' beliefs. And while a good deal was said about general 
  Christian principles of love and forgiveness, it is not those principles, but 
  much more specific Biblical authority, as cited by the appellants from the 
  Book of Proverbs, that is claimed to mandate the obligation or right of these 
  Christians to inflict corporal punishment at all: which is the question that 
  is in issue in this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>Accordingly, we have to give close attention to 
  the biblical texts that were relied on in the evidence, the most significant 
  of which I have set out in §§ 6-8 above. Any fair reading of those texts 
  indicates a regime very different from that which the appellants practise and 
  ask this court to authorise. Injunctions not to spare the rod; to beat the 
  child with a rod to deliver his soul from hell; and, in the appellants' 
  argument before us as set out in §4 above and repeated in the oral submissions 
  summarised in §12 above, to confront children who, as a class, are born with 
  hearts inclined to evil; would seem to call for use of physical punishment on 
  a much more extensive basis, and in a more rigorous form, than that in fact 
  adopted by the appellants. And, in particular, the biblical texts hardly seem 
  to contemplate the witholding of corporal punishment where the child does not 
  volitionally accept the need for that form of correction: which is stressed as 
  a feature of the regime that is described in the evidence referred to in §10 
  above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>Such a line of enquiry into the precise nature of 
  the belief that is asserted is forced on the court specifically because of the 
  importance that the Convention attaches to religious belief, and to a proper 
  analysis of the nature of that belief, as demonstrated in the judgment of the 
  ECtHR in <I>Kokkinakis v Greece</I> (1993) 17 EHRR 397, cited in more detail 
  by Rix LJ in § 143-144 of his judgment. If, as I consider to be the case, the 
  practice relied on does not follow the statements of belief on which it 
  purports to be based, then it is much more difficult to accept that the 
  practice is an expression of a religious imperative, as opposed to being a 
  feature of a regime whose connexion with religion is much more elusive. And in 
  our case the difference is not merely in matters of detail and degree. I have 
  not found it at all possible to reconcile the carefully hedged-around and 
  limited practices described in the evidence with the scriptural injunctions 
  that are said to mandate them. Those practices, although based on the broad 
  injunctions of the Book of Proverbs, seem to be worked out as a matter of 
  judgement in each separate school: as was indeed effectively conceded, in the 
  context of the disagreement as to whether or not the punishment could be 
  inflicted by the parents, as described in §12 above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>I return to these considerations when I address 
  article 2 of the First Protocol. First, however, I address article 9: which in 
  my view is not engaged in this case whatever view is taken of the nature of 
  the religious beliefs asserted by the appellants. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Article 9</I></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>The relevant part of article 9 relied on by the 
  appellants is freedom to manifest religion or belief. Section 548 does not 
  interfere with anyone's freedom to believe in, or to seek to persuade others 
  to believe in, the merits of corporal punishment, whether on religious or on 
  secular grounds. It does not prevent democratic activity, in whatever form, to 
  seek to reintroduce corporal punishment in schools, whether public or private. 
  Nor does it prevent the parents from themselves inflicting corporal punishment 
  on their children. Article 9 is therefore only engaged if the teachers when 
  inflicting corporal punishment, and the parents when supporting them in that 
  action, are manifesting their religion or beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>I will accept for the purposes of this part of the 
  enquiry, as did the judge, that the punishment that the teachers inflict and 
  that the parents support is seen by them as inflicted and supported in pursuit 
  of a religious belief; even though, as I have already indicated, the nature 
  and basis of that belief is somewhat elusive. However, the immediate question, 
  whatever in detail may be the belief that is engaged, is whether the parents, 
  in supporting the regime of corporal punishment practised in the schools, and 
  the teachers in inflicting that corporal punishment, "manifest" that belief. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>An early case on this issue is the decision of the 
  Commission in <I>Arrowsmith v UK</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/7.html">(1978) 3 EHRR 218</a>. There the Commission

  <BLOCKQUOTE>The leaflets did not express pacifist views. The Commission 
    considers, therefore, that the applicant, by distributing the leaflets, did

  of its decision,</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Public declarations proclaiming generally the idea of pacifism 
    and urging the acceptance of a commitment to non-violence may be considered 
    as a normal and recognised manifestation of pacifist belief. However, when

    cannot be considered to be as such protected by Article 9(1), even when they 
    are motivated or influenced by it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>This view of article 9 was also adopted by the 
  Commission in <I>X v United Kingdom</I> (1984) 6 EHRR 558: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Article 9 primarily protects the sphere of personal beliefs and 
    religious creeds, <I>i.e.</I> the area which is sometimes called the 
    <I>forum internum</I>. In addition, it protects acts which are intimately 
    linked to these attitudes, such as acts of worship and devotion which are 
    aspects of the practice of a religion or a belief in a generally recognised 
    form.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>This apparently limited approach to Article 9(1) 
  followed from a close consideration of the text of the article. The somewhat 
  stilted language of the English version of the article, and the use of the 
  word, unusual in English, "manifest", is explicible, as the Commission 
  recognised in the passage quoted above from §70 of its decision, by its being 
  a translation from the French. The French text makes clear, as the Commission 
  found, that the article 9(1) protection is rooted in the concept of religious 
  teaching and worship. Both such activities involve, as the Commission put it 
  in its §71, the "expression" of belief. Where such expression is absent, 
  article 9(1) is not engaged. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>The ECtHR has paid similarly close attention to 
  the detailed wording of article 9, and to the illumination that is to be found 
  from the French text. Thus in a case concerning Jewish ritual slaughter, 
  <I>Jewish Liturgical Association v France </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/351.html">(2000) 9 BHRC 27</a> at §73, the 
  Court said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The court next reiterates that art 9 lists a number of forms 
    which manifestation of one's religion or belief may take, namely worship, 
    teaching, practice and observance (see <I>Kalac v Turkey</I>, para 31). It 
    is not contested that ritual slaughter, as indeed its name indicates, 
    constitutes a rite or "rite" (the word in the French text of the convention 
    corresponding to 'observance' in the English), whose purpose is to provide 
    Jews with meat from animals slaughtered in accordance with religious 
    prescriptions, which is an essential aspect of practice of the Jewish 
    religion."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Court's view of the limits of article 9 within worship, teaching and 
  ritual is reinforced by the authority that it cited in <I>Jewish Liturgical 
  Authority, Kalac v Turkey</I> (1997) 27 EHRR 522, where the Court said, at 
  §27:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Article 9 lists a number of forms which manifestation of one's 
    religion or belief may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and 
    observance. Nevertheless, Article 9 does not protect every act motivated or 
    inspired by a religion or belief."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>This guidance from the Commission and from the 
  Court makes it particularly important to consider with care the nature of the 
  activity that is said to be protected by article 9. What section 548 prohibits 
  is the infliction of corporal punishment by teachers, even with the approval 
  or authorisation of the parents. As already observed, it does not prevent the 
  holding of beliefs in favour of corporal punishment, nor the proselytising of 
  those beliefs, nor even the teaching of them in the schools. The question 
  therefore is whether the teachers, when they inflict corporal punishment as 
  part of their educational work, manifest a religion or belief in the sense 
  analysed by the Commission and the Court. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>Viewed objectively, the act of inflicting corporal 
  punishment is entirely neutral as to the beliefs that inspire it, as it is as 
  to the beliefs that, in the language that the Commission adopted in 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I>, it expresses. In the days when corporal punishment was 
  endemic in the British educational system, those who practised it no doubt had 
  a wide variety of reasons for thinking it to be necessary. Similarly in the 
  case of Miss Arrowsmith. Opposition to the presence of the British Army in 
  Northern Ireland, even when it took the unlawful form adopted by Miss 
  Arrowsmith, could be, and was, based by a wide range of people on a wide range 
  of arguments. Objectively, such opposition said nothing about, did not 
  manifest, pacifism. The Commission regarded that as fatal to Arrowsmith's 
  case, even though it accepted that pacifism was the motivation for her 
  objective actions. In holding thus that religious motivation was not enough, 
  the Commission was exactly anticipating what was said by the ECtHR in 
  <I>Kalac</I>, cited in §31 above. I can see no difference in the present case. 
  The infliction of corporal punishment expresses nothing as to the religion of 
  the inflicter. That it is accompanied by assertions as to religious 
  motivation, none of which are in any way rendered unlawful by section 548, 
  does not alter the position; any more than Miss Arrowsmith's assertions of 
  pacifist motivation were seen by the Commission as bringing her within article 
  9. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>I would make two further points. First, we have to 
  decide whether we are to take in any way seriously the language employed by 
  the Commission in <I>X v United Kingdom</I>, cited in §29 above. The 
  Commission said that article 9 protects acts </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"which are intimately linked to [religious] attitudes, such as 
    acts of worship and devotion which are aspects of the practice of a 
  religion"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>That approach is of a piece with that of the Court in <I>Kalac, </I>cited 
  in §31 above, which sees article 9 in terms of acts of worship and ritial. On 
  that basis, it seems impossible to bring the acts of corporal punishment in 
  the present case within the ambit of article 9. Whatever may be claimed as to 
  the scriptural authority for that form of punishment, the act of inflicting it 
  is simply not an act of worship or devotion, nor a "rite", nor any act of 
  teaching or observance that is reasonably cognate to such acts. Nor did the 
  Commission in <I>X v United Kingdom</I> suggest that its formulation was by 
  way of example only, or the expression of a narrow form of a much wider 
  regime. It plainly spoke as it did because it continued to see article 9 as 
  limited to distinctively religious or propagandist activity: as it had 
  formulated the matter in <I>Arrowsmith</I>, and as the Court subsequently 
  viewed article 9 in <I>Jewish Liturgical Association</I> and <I>Kalac</I>.</P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>I accept that it is possible (though I have found 
  no case that actually supports the proposition) that article 9(1), when it 
  refers to the protection of manifestation of belief by "practice", may extend 
  further than the core meanings of worship, devotion and proselytism that are 
  stressed in the authorities already cited; and I would countenance that 
  possibility even though the use in the French text of the plural form 
  "practiques" does suggest something closely allied to worship. On this view, 
  an established practice that is mandated by a particular religion as a 
  necessary expression of its beliefs would be protected by article 9(1). But 
  the present case does not qualify under this rubric, however widely this 
  aspect of article 9(1) may be viewed. As we have seen, the "practice" in the 
  present case cannot be stated more clearly than that corporal punishment 
  should be available for some sorts of offences, but with the mode of 
  administration; the identify of the persons who administer the punishment; 
  and, it would seem, the types of offences for which it is imposed; varying 
  between believers on no more worked-out basis than their particular perception 
  of the limits imposed by Christianity, very broadly understood. It is quite 
  impossible to characterise the practice or practices sought to be protected in 
  this case as a clear, uniform and agreed requirement of the religion in 
  question; in contrast to, for instance, the requirements of dress or diet 
  imposed by some non-Christian religions. The various acts of the appellants in 
  this case are, as is accepted, motivated by religious belief; but for the 
  reasons indicated they cannot qualify as the practice, in article 9(1) terms, 
  of that belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>It follows that I am respectfully unable to follow 
  the analysis adopted by Rix LJ at §165 of his judgment that <I>Arrowsmith</I> 
  is a decision limited to, or at least strongly constrained by, its own facts. 
  In my view, the Commission carefully reasoned out the ambit of article 9 in 
  general terms; reinforced that analysis in its subsequent decision in <I>X v 
  United Kingdom</I>; and was supported in that analysis by the Court in the 
  cases that I have already cited.. I am also, with equal respect, unable to 
  accept the view of Rix LJ, at § 166 of his judgment, that the decision of the 
  Strasbourg Court in <I>Kokkinakis</I> offsets or differs from the 
  jurisprudence of <I>Arrowsmith</I>. Proselytism, the activity in issue in 
  <I>Kokkinakis</I>, is of the very essence of manifestation of belief as 
  understood in <I>Arrowsmith</I>. The Commission so said in terms, at §71 of 
  its decision in that case: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Public declarations proclaiming generally the idea of 
    pacificism and urging the acceptance of a commitment to non-violence may be 
    considered as a normal and recognised manifestation of pacifist 
  belief"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>That the Court in <I>Kokkinakis</I> protected the act of urging others to 
  adopt a particular religion was therefore wholly in accord with 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I>. And I would add that the actual decision in 
  <I>Kokkinakis</I> does not in any event assist in our case, because the acts 
  in issue here are not on any view ones of proselytism.</P>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>Mr Diamond, appreciating the difficulties that 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I> presented for the appellants' case, said that the case had 
  been wrongly decided; only carried the authority of the Commission; was out of 
  date; and should not be followed by us. I am afraid that I cannot agree with 
  those arguments either. I would be prepared to agree that the court's 
  obligation under section 2 of the Human Rights Act to "take into account" the 
  jurisprudence of the Convention organs, including the Commission, does not 
  place the English courts under an obligation to follow that jurisprudence just 
  as if it were binding domestic authority. At the same time, however, the court 
  must tread very carefully even where it thinks that rulings by the Court or 
  Commission may eventually prove to have been mistaken. I would venture in that 
  connexion to refer to the judgments in this court in <I>R (Taylor) v SSHD 
  </I><A href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1698.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1698.html">[2002] 2 WLR 1143</a></A>. I am certainly not prepared to ignore, and much less to hold to 
  have been wrong, a reasoned decision of the Commission such as 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I>: which, as I have sought to demonstrate, pays careful regard 
  to the text and to the objectives of the article of the Convention that it had 
  under review. The approach in <I>Arrowsmith </I>has, moreover, been reflected 
  in the more recent judgments of the Court, already cited. Mr Diamond said that 
  those authorities also did not approach article 9 in the correct manner. 
  Again, I am unable to agree. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>It is important also to have in mind the practical 
  implications if the Commission's limited approach to article 9 is not 
  respected. As the quotation from the appellants' written argument before this 
  court that is set out in §4 above indicates, the appellants present their 
  beliefs as those of orthodox Christianity. The court cannot shield from its 
  attention the fact that adherence to orthodox Christian belief commits 
  believers to the obligation to perform, or to the permissibility of 
  performing, a very wide range of acts in society, of which the disciplining of 
  school children by one means rather than another is only one example. If the 
  appellants are right, all such acts are, by the very fact of their actual or 
  asserted religious motivation, protected from control by the state by the 
  provisions of article 9. But both the Commission and the Court have limited 
  the reach of article 9 by not extending its protection to acts performed for 
  religious motives simply on the ground that such a claim can be made for them. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>Nor is it possible to avoid that difficulty by 
  saying that no harm is done by interpreting the reach of article 9 widely, 
  because practical utility can be introduced by arguments under article 9(2). 
  Such an analysis undermines an important principle of Convention 
  jurisprudence, that of the balance that that jurisprudence seeks to strike 
  between the assertion of Convention rights, on the one hand; and on the other 
  hand the interests of the nations that are the subjects of the Convention in 
  being free to legislate by democratic means in areas that are potentially 
  affected by those rights. That balance is struck in different ways and in 
  different terms according to the particular Convention rights that are in 
  issue. A conspicuous example of the balancing process, not in issue in this 
  case, is the development by the Strasbourg Court of the doctrine of the margin 
  of appreciation. In relation to articles 8-11 of the Convention, the balance 
  is to be found in the original terms of the Convention itself, by requiring 
  the respondent state, once the case is found to fall under the first limb of 
  the article, to justify its legislation; and, rightly, the state is then 
  limited in the grounds on which that justification may be based. To place the 
  state under that burden however represents a significant limitation on the 
  freedom of action of its democratic institutions. I have no doubt that the 
  Convention organs had that consideration well in mind when interpreting the 
  ambit of a concept as potentially broad, as in the present case it is asserted 
  to be, as manifestation of religious belief. That concept is rightly limited 
  in the Convention to worship, proselytism, and possibly, in the terms 
  recognised in §35 above, to mandated religious "practice"; because a state 
  would properly need to demonstrate very strong reasons for interfering with 
  such activities. But an extension of article 9 beyond those core religious 
  values and practices unjustifiably widens the restrictions placed on the 
  state; and inappropriately requires the state to justify legislation that does 
  not trench upon the important freedoms that article 9(1) does protect. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>For the reasons indicated, therefore, I am of the 
  clear opinion that the teachers in inflicting corporal punishment, and the 
  parents in supporting and seeking the infliction of corporal punishment, do

  article 9. </A>

  relevance to this case. In taking that step the court had in mind that it is

  <P></P>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>The facts of <I>Pretty</I> are too well known, and 
  too recent, to require reiteration. Amongst the arguments deployed by Mrs 
  Pretty in her attempt to oblige the Director of Public Prosecutions to withold 
  criminal sanctions from her husband if he were to assist her suicide was a 
  claim that the suicide would be the manifestation on her part of a relevant 
  belief under article 9. The joinder of issue before the House on this point 
  can only be understood by reference to the arguments of the parties, to be 
  found in the official Law Reports. Mrs Pretty argued, [2002] AC at p 805D, 
  that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
    guaranteed by article 9 entitles the claimant to believe in suicide for 
    herself with the assistance of her husband (see <I>Arrowsmith v United 
    Kingdom </I>(1980) 19 DR 5), and in refusing the undertaking the Director 
    has interfered with her right to manifest her belief in that the consequence 
    of his refusal will be to deny her that assistance."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The intervener:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"A claim to entitlement to manifest her belief in assisted 
    suicide by practising it lies outside the claimant's right to manifest 
    belief contemplated [by] article 9. That is intended to apply to religious 
    practices, not to give individuals a guaranteed right to act generally in 
    the course of everyday living in pursuance of any beliefs they might hold, 
    whether religious or secular."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>The House only dealt briefly with this point, and 
  I would not pretend that its observations could be relied on in the present 
  case if the general trend of Convention authority pointed in a different 
  direction. That said, however, it seems clear, first, that the House agreed 
  with the general thrust of the respondent's argument, as just set out; and, 
  second, that although recognising that the claim would fail in any event under 
  article 9(2), Mrs Pretty's argument was seen as not even qualifying under 
  article 9(1). Thus, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill at §31: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"One may accept that Mrs Pretty has a sincere belief in the 
    virtue of assisted suicide. She is free to hold and express that belief. But 
    her belief cannot found a requirement that her husband should be absolved 
    from the consequences of conduct which, although it would be consistent with 
    her belief, is proscribed by the criminal law. And if she were able to 
    establish an infringement of her right, the justification shown by the state 
    in relation to article 8 would still defeat it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Per Lord Steyn at §63:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Counsel submitted that Mrs Pretty is entitled to manifest her 
    belief in assisted suicide by committing it. This cannot be right. [Article 
    9] was never intended to give individuals a right to perform acts in 
    pursuance of whatever beliefs they may hold, eg to attack places where 
    experiments are conducted on animals. The article does not yield support for 
    the specific proposition for which it is invoked. In any event, as 
    discussed, section 2 [of the Suicide Act 1961] is a legitimate, rational and 
    proportionate response to the wider problem of vulnerable people who would

  <LI value=44><A name=para44>As I have already accepted, Mrs Pretty's case was 
  significantly different from our case. At the same time, however, I find it 
  difficult to see how the House could have dismissed her article 9 claim in the 
  short order set out above if the construction of article 9 urged by the 
  appellants in our case were correct. The infliction of corporal punishment is 
  said to be a manifestation of the appellants' beliefs, not because it is an 
  act of worship, or of proselytism, but rather because it is undertaken in 
  pursuit of the appellants', in this case religious, beliefs: a claim of the 
  very nature that, as it seems to me, Lords Steyn and Hope, whose opinions on 
  the Convention points were agreed by Lords Bingham and Scott, held not to be 
  sufficient to engage article 9. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>Accordingly, although because of the brief 
  treatment of the point in argument I would not be minded to rely on 
  <I>Pretty</I> as any sort of binding authority on this point, I do nonetheless 
  respectfully consider that the approach of their Lordships is a significant 
  pointer away from the construction of article 9 urged by the appellants in our 
  case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>I should add, for completeness, that Mrs Pretty's 
  case was subsequently considered by the Strasbourg Court: <I>Pretty v UK</I>, 
  Application 2346/02. That Court also dealt with the article 9 point very 
  shortly, and dismissed it. However, it is not without some interest that in so 
  doing the Strasbourg Court said, at §82 of its judgment: </A>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The Court does not doubt the firmness of the applicant's views 
    concerning assisted suicide but would observe that not all opinions or

    the Convention. Her claims do not involve a form of manifestation of a 
    religion or belief, through worship, teaching, practice or observance as 
    described in the second sentence of the first paragraph. As found by the 
    Commission, the term "practice" as employed in Article 9 § 1 does not cover 
    each act which is motivated or influenced by a religion or belief

    October 1978, DR 19, p. 5, at p. 19, § 71)."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I would venture to say no more than that this statement appears to be a 
  further affirmation of the Court's understanding of the jurisprudence of

    that right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The appellants said, in an argument not adduced before Elias J, that this 
  section placed on the court a particular obligation to protect religious 
  rights. That should therefore affect the court's approach to section 548, in 
  the sense of making it particularly alert to ensure that that section, or any 
  other legislation, did not trespass on the freedom of religious organisations: 
  which the schools in this case could be said to be.</P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>I must express some reserve about the last element 
  in that claim. I am far from certain that Parliament intended the concept of 
  "religious organisations" to extend as far as schools, or for that matter 
  bodies such as sports clubs or benevolent associations, that are conducted 
  according to religious principles; nor can the appellants, or at least the 
  parents, easily be said to be "members" of the schools. I however do not 
  pursue that detailed question, because it is clear that in any event section 
  13 cannot apply in the present case. That is because "the Convention right to 
  freedom of thought, conscience and religion" plainly refers to the article 9 
  right. If, as I have found, the appellants' conduct does not involve exercise 
  of the article 9 right, then section 13 cannot be engaged, and adds nothing to 
  the argument. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>I do not agree that that interpretation evacuates

  Convention or otherwise, such as rights under employment or discrimination 
  legislation. What exact process the court is then required to go through in 
  having "particular regard" to the "importance" of the article 9 right; and 
  whether a presumption of priority of one article of the Convention over others 
  is consistent with the United Kingdom's obligations under the Convention,

  <LI value=52><A name=para52>The United Kingdom had argued before the Court in 
  <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans</I> that, if the applicants were right, parents could

  article 2. It said, at §36 of its judgment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In its ordinary meaning the word 'convictions', taken on its 
    own, is not synonymous with the words 'opinons' and 'ideas', such as are

    '<I>convictions</I>') appearing in Article 9….and denotes views that attain 
    a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance…..Having 
    regard to the Convention as a whole, including Article 17, the expression 
    'philosphical convictions' in the present context denotes, in the Court's 
    opinion, such convictions as are worthy of respect in a 'democratic society' 
    and are not incompatible with human dignity….The applicant's views relate to 
    a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour, namely the 
    integrity of the person, the propriety or otherwise of the infliction of 
    corporal punishment and the exclusion of the distress which the risk of such 
    punishment entails. They are views which satisfy each of the various

  <LI value=53><A name=para53>The Court reverted to article 2 in <I>Valsamis v

  holidays, a parade commemorating Greek National Day. She claimed that 
  attendance would have been inconsistent with her and her parents' pacifist

  <BLOCKQUOTE>The verb "respect" means more than "acknowledge" or "take into

    questions of expediency on which is not for the Court to rule and whose

    Given that discretion, the Court has held that the second sentence of 
    Article 2 forbids the State "to pursue an aim of indoctrination that might 
    be regarded as not respecting parents religious and philosophical 
    convictions. This is the limit that must not be exceeded".</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>Looking objectively both at the nature of the

  <P>The latter part of that observation is again quoted by the Court from its 
  judgment in <I>Kjeldsen and others</I>.</P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>The appellants said that that jurisprudence, and 
  in particular the statement in <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans</I>, led to a simple 
  solution in our case. Their belief in the need to have corporal punishment 
  available had quite as much cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance as 
  did Mrs Campbell's belief that corporal punishment should not be available. If 
  Mrs Cambell's conviction on the one side of the argument about corporal 
  punishment had to be respected, so should be their conviction on the other. 
  And their conviction did not infringe the human dignity of the child, but 
  rather enhanced it by its respect for what Mr Jones, the headmaster quoted in 
  §10, above described as the development of Christian character in the pupils. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>Elias J did not accept this argument. He said this 
  at §§ 44-46 of his judgment, in a passage that because it is severely 
  criticised before us I am constrained to set out in full: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>44. There is some attraction in this argument, but ultimately I reject it. 
  It is seeking to equate the non-administration of corporal punishment with its 
  administration and to say that both constitute a philosophical or religious 
  conviction. In my judgment, as the European Court of Human rights appears to 
  have thought, the two cannot simply be equated in that way since the law is 
  not neutral about the imposition of physical force. The law has always shown a 
  respect for the physical integrity of the individual: any intentional assault 
  is unlawful unless there is a defence of justification. Accordingly, it 
  requires a stronger case to justify the right to inflict physical injury than 
  to justify a right not to have it inflicted.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>45. In my view this reflects a more deep-seated distinction between the two 
  positions. The belief that no corporal punishment should be imposed can 
  properly be described as a philosophical or (in some cases) religious 
  conviction. It is a belief that in principle no one should be so punished. By 
  contrast, I do not consider that a belief that corporal punishment should be 
  imposed can properly be so described. This has got nothing to do with the 
  genuiness of the belief or its intrinsic merits. Rather it has to do with its 
  nature and character. Nobody suggests that the corporal punishment should 
  automatically be applied to all children as a matter of principle. For some 
  children it may never be necessary. It is envisaged that it will be needed 
  only for rare cases of relatively serious indiscipline. The parents wish it to 
  be administered in such circumstances because they consider it to be more 
  efficacious method of securing appropriate discipline. I do not think that it 
  is appropriate to describe a belief that one measure is more effective than 
  another as a philosophical or religious conviction even if the reason for 
  holding that belief is that it is supported by a religious text. It is not one 
  of the articles of faith. It may be accurate to say that someone has a 
  religious conviction that everything in the Bible is true, but it would be 
  surely odd to describe, say, a belief in angels as a religious conviction or 
  as itself constituting an article of religious faith. It is a belief which is 
  in accordance with the religious faith, but it does not embody or define the 
  belief or conviction itself.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>46. Even if the parents believe that effective discipline cannot be secured 
  in any other way, that still does not, in my judgment, convert the belief in 
  its value as more than a belief – albeit genuinely and strongly held – as to 
  its efficacy. Corporal punishment is not being invoked for its own sake but in 
  order to help secure the religious convictions that underpin the Christian 
  convictions of these families. Accordingly I do not accept that the belief in 
  the desirability of corporal punishment, even although it is derived from the 
  Christian convictions held by these parents can be properly defined as a 
  religious conviction in its own right.</P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>The appellants criticised this passage, first 
  because they said that Elias J had "transgressed the State/Church divide". His 
  analysis involved impermissible discussion of, or speculation about, the 
  content and nature of the appellants' Christian faith. While, again, I would 
  not wish to adopt every element in the judge's reasoning, I do not think that 
  that criticism is valid. As I have already indicated, when faced with claims 
  as to the nature and content of the "convictions" that are sought to be 
  protected under article 2 of the first protocol the court, in applying that 
  article, must necessarily analyse those claims in order to consider whether 
  the alleged breach of the convictions that they assert infringes the 
  particular rules of the Convention. That is what I have felt forced to do in 
  §§ 23-26 above. That is what the Court did in §31 of its judgment in 
  <I>Valsamis</I>: see §§ 55-56 above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=para58>As I understood his argument, Mr Diamond said that 
  because assertions by believers that their belief had been infringed by 
  particular state or secular arrangements had to be taken as given, the 
  Strasbourg Court had been in error in <I>Valsamis </I>in entering upon a 
  review of the nature of the religious faith asserted in that case. Again, I 
  cannot agree. The broad approach of the Strasbourg Court in <I>Valsamis</I> is 
  plainly a relevant source of guidance for us. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>The appellants next argued that Elias J was simply 
  wrong in refusing to accord their belief in corporal punishment the same 
  "respect" as the belief that corporal punishment should not be imposed that 
  was respected in <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans</I>. Their belief achieved the 
  necessary level of organisation and cogency; and was certainly worthy of 
  consideration in a democratic society. This is the most difficult part of the 
  case, and has to be approached, as the Court in <I>Valsamis</I> approached the 
  issue, by an analysis of the claim made by the appellants against the range 
  and content of article 2. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=60><A name=para60>It is striking that in <I>Valsamis</I> the Court 
  appears to have thought relevant to article 2 issues generally the limited 
  view of the article as prohibiting indoctrination that it had adopted in 
  <I>Kieldsen and others</I>: see §§ 55-56 above. I do not think that Elias J 
  was correct, in §53 of his judgment, in resolving the present case by directly 
  applying to it that observation of the Court, on the basis that no 
  indoctrination of the children is imposed or permitted by section 548. It is 
  however clear that the generally cautious view of the reach of article 2 that 
  was taken in <I>Valsamis</I> must be kept in mind when a court tries to apply 
  the article in other cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=61><A name=para61>If the parents' conviction were merely that one 
  method of discipline is more effective than others in certain types of 
  situation, then it would, I think, be clear that article 2 could not be 
  engaged. The case would clearly come within the area of questions of 
  expediency that the Court in <I>Kieldsen and others</I> and in <I>Valsamis</I> 
  thought to fall within the competence of the national state. Is the case 
  different because it is asserted that the availability of that method of 
  discipline is mandated by Christian doctrine or belief? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=62><A name=para62>At this stage of the argument we have to confront 
  again the nature and basis of the appellants' beliefs and practices, that I 
  have discussed in §§ 21-24 above. The appellants say that the source of their 
  "conviction", in article 2 terms, is to be found in the biblical texts that 
  they cite. But, as I have indicated, the practice that they wish to justify is 
  very different from what those texts appear to require. As explained in the 
  appellants' submissions, the texts mandate confrontation of the evil heart of 
  man. The practice as to how that is done is however much more limited than 
  those texts would seem to require, and varies from school to school. The 
  disparity is sought to be explained by recourse to the Christian message of 
  love and reconciliation that, as I understand it, leads the appellants to 
  adopt only a very limited form of corporal punishment, inflicted only in 
  extreme cases, in a mild manner, and with the consent of the child; and in 
  some cases inflicted by the parent at the instance of the school, in others by 
  the teachers themselves. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=63><A name=para63>I do not doubt the appellants' sincerity in seeing 
  the Christian message of love and forgiveness as permitting them to inflict 
  corporal punishment only in the manner and circumstances that they describe. I 
  am, however, quite unable to see that message, as it is deployed in the 
  present case, as counting as a "conviction" in the particular sense that 
  article 2 requires. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=64><A name=para64>First, as to the present case, what has to be 
  justified, because that is the activity prohibited by section 548, is the 
  infliction of corporal punishment <I>at all. </I>There has been nothing shown 
  to us contained within the general Christian message, as opposed to what is 
  set out in the specific and much more far-reaching quotations from the Book of 
  Proverbs, that mandates or even permits corporal punishment. The Christian 
  message may influence the manner in which the claimants inflict corporal 
  punishment, or the offences for which they inflict it, but the latter are not 
  what is in issue in this case. What the claimants have to demonstrate is that 
  their religion obliges them to inflict corporal punishment: and that 
  obligation, and the nature and source of it, is, as for instance Mr Williamson 
  stresses in his evidence quoted in §8 above, to be found in the specific 
  injunctions of the Book of Proverbs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=65><A name=para65>Second, even if it were permissible to rely on an 
  unspecified appeal to the Christian message in the present context, it would 
  be to veil reality if the court did not recognise that that message is couched 
  in extremely generalised terms, and has been interpreted by different groups 
  as driving to very different conclusions as to belief, behaviour and 
  tolerance: often, unhappily, in direct conflict with each other. Asserted 
  adherence to the Christian message, without much more specific exposition of 
  the particular beliefs that that message engenders, is thus far too 
  generalised and undefined a position to count as a "conviction" for the 
  purposes of article 2. That is not because of any scepticism about the 
  commitment of those who profess that message, whether in this case or 
  otherwise. Rather, reliance on the Christian message, as that message appears 
  to the particular individual, necessarily lacks the specific direction of the 
  belief to the subject-matter in dispute that the Strasbourg Court has seen as 
  required under article 2. And that unease is reinforced by the disagreements 
  between the various appellants as to the mode of infliction of the corporal 
  punishment, that I have referred to in §§ 9-10 above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=66><A name=para66>This point can be demonstrated from <I>Campbell 
  &amp; Cosans</I> itself. It will be recalled that the concern of the United 
  Kingdom was that, if the applicants in that case were right, objections to any 
  form of disciplinary treatment could be elevated into a "conviction" that had 
  to be respected under article 2. It was in response to that concern that the 
  Court formulated the criteria of an article 2 conviction that are quoted in § 
  52 above. I would think it plain that a general statement of belief in 
  Christian principles, without more, could not possibly have been seen as 
  meeting those requirements. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=67><A name=para67>I would therefore respectfully agree with the 
  general approach of Elias J to the particular facts of this case. He pointed 
  out that corporal punishment, at least in the form that it takes in the 
  appellants' schools, is not claimed to be an article of faith, nor a measure 
  that is required for every child or for any but a small number of offences. 
  And I agree with the judge when he says: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I do not think that it is appropriate to describe a belief that 
    one measure is more effective than another as a philosophical or religious 
    conviction even if the reason for holding that belief is that it is 
    supported by a religious text"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=68><A name=para68>The short point is, therefore, that the exposition 
  of the appellants' beliefs as set out in the evidence before us does not 
  satisfy the requirements laid down by the Court for the recognition of a 
  conviction in article 2 terms. The core belief, as explained to us, is the 
  need to confront the evil heart of man. It is that objective that is said to 
  justify and require the use of corporal punishment. That is far too 
  generalised an objective to qualify in <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans</I> terms. And 
  when belief is carried into action, which is when its operation and 
  manifestation is allegedly interfered with by section 548, the evidence 
  reveals a wide range of practices, difficult to reconcile with the belief 
  itself, and in any event not reaching the level of cohesion and cogency 
  required by <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans.</I> </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=para69>Moreover, I cannot ignore the further observation 
  of Elias J in §44 of his judgment that, since the law is not neutral about the 
  imposition of physical force, a more specific justification is likely to be 
  required for the retention of corporal punishment than for its exclusion. The 
  Court in <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans</I> referred to objection to the infliction 
  of corporal punishment as relating to a weighty and substantial aspect of 
  human life and behaviour, including the integrity of the person and the 
  exclusion of distress. The Court appeared to think that something of that 
  order would be required before a conviction sufficient to require alteration 
  of the state's educational regime could be found. That cautious approach is 
  also reflected in <I>Valsamis</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=70><A name=para70>While not undervaluing the appellants' claim that 
  they address the moral as opposed to the physical integrity of the children, 
  those convictions only relate to one, in the appellants' practice as described 
  to us a comparatively rare, way of assisting and supporting that moral 
  integrity. That is in any event insufficient to count as a conviction in 
  support of corporal punishment of the type that the Court appeared to require 
  in <I>Campbell &amp; Cosans</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=71><A name=para71>I accordingly do not agree that article 2 of the 
  first protocol requires this court to rewrite section 548 in order to 
  accommodate the regime that the parents wish to be operated at their 
  children's schools. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The principle in </I>Kalac v Turkey <I>and other cases</I></P>
  <LI value=72><A name=para72>After argument had closed the court reached the 
  view that <I>Kalac v Turkey</I> and other related determinations of the 
  Convention organs might have a bearing on the issues in this appeal. None of 
  these authorities had been put before us by the parties. We accordingly 
  invited written submissions from both sides on the authorities, submissions 
  that were made at some considerable length; and conducted a substantial 
  further oral hearing. The authorities are fully addressed in the judgment Rix 
  LJ, in terms that I cannot improve on. I can therefore limit myself here to a 
  summary account of my own conclusions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=73><A name=para73>These cases are in any event a valuable further 
  reminder of the caution with which the Convention organs approach claims to be 
  exempted from national laws on the basis of religious belief, and therefore 
  are of some general relevance to the construction and application of both 
  article 9 and article 2 of the First Protocol. However, more particularly, the 
  cases incorporate some more specific principles that are of relevance to our 
  own case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=74><A name=para74>The most important, and most general, of those 
  principles is that, when faced with a claim asserting interference with the 
  practice or manifestation of a religious belief, the court must look carefully 
  at the terms and nature of that belief, in order to see whether it could be 
  properly and effectively exercised by the claimant in some manner that would 
  not conflict with the national law. In all of the employment cases [<I>Kalac v 
  </I>Turkey (1997) 27 EHRR 552; <I>Stedman v United Kingdom </I>(1994) 23 EHRR 
  CD 168; <I>Konttinen v </I>Finland (application 24949/94)] the point was taken

  belief in issue as being the obligation of ultra-orthodox Jews to eat only 
  glatt, ritually slaughtered, meat, and at §80 said of limitations on ritual 
  slaughter within France: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the court's opinion, there would be interference with the 
    freedom to manifest one's religion only if the illegality of performing 
    ritual slaughter made it impossible for ultra-orthodox Jews to eat meat from 
    animals slaughtered in accordance with the religious prescriptions they 
    considered applicable."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=75><A name=para75>It is not necessary to go as far as characterising 
  the test in terms of impossibility in order to apply the principle to the 
  present case. In whatever way the asserted belief is analysed, its essence is 
  that corporal punishment should be available to correct misbehaviour whether 
  it occurs at home or at school. The end that the parents see their religion, 
  relevantly to this case, as obliging them to seek, the infliction of physical 
  punishment in relation to an offence committed at school, can be achieved by 
  every case being referred by the school to the parent, and the parent himself 
  inflicting reasonable chastisement in respect of it, either by visiting the 
  school for that purpose, or when the child returns home. That would not touch 
  section 548 at all, since the chastisement would not be inflicted by a 
  teacher. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=76><A name=para76>I have not overlooked that, when confronted with 
  this proposition, the appellants produced the evidence of Mr Williamson and Mr 
  Sammons. They said that what the parents wanted was swift correction of error, 
  without the trauma and possible inconvenience of direct involvement of the 
  parents themselves. That could only be achieved by the infliction of 
  punishment being undertaken by the teachers: the regime that section 548 
  forbade. There are considerable problems with this evidence. Its claims as to 
  the attitude of parents generally were really no more than assertion, there 
  being no indication that anyone other than the two authors had contributed to 
  the evidence; and there is the substantial difficulty that at least one 
  school, whose practices are relied on by the appellants elsewhere in the case, 
  regards parental involvement in the infliction of punishment as a central part 
  of its regime: see §11 above, and the further account of the evidence that is 
  given by Rix LJ at §184 of his judgment.. I would, therefore, be most 
  reluctant to act on the new evidence to reach any conclusion that differed 
  from that to be drawn from the evidence that was before Elias J. But it is not 
  necessary to pursue those difficulties further, because in the relevant 
  context of article 9 and of article 2 of the First Protocol the objections 
  raised by Mr Williamson and Mr Sammons cannot be characterised as involving 
  issues of belief or of religious or philosophical conviction, as opposed to 
  being issues of preferred educational practice. And however diffident one may 
  be in questioning the appellants' view of scriptural authority, I find it 
  quite impossible to accept that the injunction in the Book of Ecclesiastes as 
  to the speedy execution of sentences against an evil work (even if it is read, 
  as the appellants read it, shorn of the context identified by Rix LJ at §188 
  of his judgment) can sensibly be employed to make it a matter of religious 
  faith, as opposed to merely good practice, that punishment for offences by 
  schoolchildren should be inflicted without the delay involved in consultation 
  of their parents. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=77><A name=para77>In this way, therefore, the parents are able to 
  manifest their belief, in the context of article 9, and to ensure the 
  education of their children in conformity with their own religious convictions 
  in the context of article 2 of the First Protocol, without infringing section 
  548 at all. That is the course that the authority of the Strasbourg Court 
  requires them to take: a course that follows directly from the nature of the 
  belief that is asserted in this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=78><A name=para78>The teachers can only have a claim under article 
  9. That claim can only be based, as I understood Mr Diamond to agree, on a 
  belief that the school should uphold the parents' obligations with regard to 
  the rearing and disciplining of their children. It is not possible to say, nor 
  was it suggested, that the teachers have a belief as to their obligation to 
  inflict corporal punishment separate and different from the obligation on the 
  part of the parent to secure its infliction. It follows that, if the parents 
  adequately manifest their belief by themselves imposing punishment for 
  offences committed at school, any manifestation of a belief in the same or 
  similar terms held by the teachers can similarly be manifested by their 
  participation in a scheme whereby the parents inflict the punishment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=79><A name=para79>I have already made it clear that, in my view, 
  neither the parents' nor the teachers' beliefs are in any event relevantly 
  infringed by section 548 either in respect of article 9 or in respect of 
  article 2 of the First Protocol. However, if I were of a different mind on 
  that general question, I would consider that, for the reasons just set out in 
  §§ 74-78, the appellants still had no basis of complaint under the Convention, 
  because a means of acting on their belief in support of corporal punishment 
  without an infringement of section 548 is reasonably open to them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Article 8</I></P>
  <LI value=80><A name=para80>Counsel who appeared before Elias J agreed that, 
  if he could not succeed on the case as already described, he could not succeed 
  under article 8. Mr Diamond withdrew that concession, if concession it was. He 
  argued that the required respect for the private and family life of the 
  parents and of the children was interfered with by section 548's prohibition 
  of the corporal punishment of the children when at school, even though the 
  parents saw such punishment as an acceptable, or even necessary, part of the 
  discipline of their children, and would themselves inflict it at home. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=81><A name=para81>There were two limbs to this argument. First, that 
  the Judaeo-Christian tradition is to recognise the autonomy of the family, and 
  that the state should only interfere with arrangments within the family in 
  very extreme cases. Second, that activities within the school were either 
  themselves in private, or were an extension of the privacy of the home, and 
  interference with those activities interfered with that privacy. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=82><A name=para82>Both of these arguments suffer from the difficulty 
  that the children do not go to school simply because of a decision taken by 
  their parents, but in pursuit of an obligation imposed on the parents by the 
  state to cause their children to be educated: an obligation that could not 
  possibly be said to be inconsistent with article 8. The reality is therefore, 
  as the Court said in <I>Costello-Roberts vUK</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/16.html">(1993) 19 EHRR 112</a>[36]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The sending of a child to school necessarily involves some 
    degree of interference with his or her private life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>That participation in state-required education; albeit, as in 
  <I>Costello-Roberts</I>, by means other than those provided by the state 
  itself; therefore takes the child outside the private and family sphere. The 
  protection of family values as perceived by the parent can only be achieved in 
  the educational context through article 2 of the first protocol.</P>
  <P><I>Article 10</I></P>
  <LI value=83><A name=para83>This argument was not raised before the judge. The 
  appellants claimed that the act of infliction of corporal punishment had 
  "expressive content". It should be protected as such: just as, for instance, 
  the Court had seen the physical protests of those who disrupted hunts as 
  potentially falling under the protection of article 10 in <I>Hashman and 
  Harrup v UK</I> (1999) 30 EHRR 241. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=84><A name=para84>The argument is far too broad. First, it is 
  completely artificial to regard the teachers, when they inflict corporal 
  punishment; or the schools when with the consent of the parents they include 
  corporal punishment within the school regime; or the parents when they send 
  their children to such schools; as expressing opinions or imparting 
  information. Their position is quite different from that of demonstrators, 
  such as the hunt saboteurs who blew horns and shouted in order to disrupt the 
  hunt in <I>Hashman and Harrup</I>; the whole essence and aim of whose 
  activities is to convey their beliefs. Second, what section 548 prevents is 
  the teachers <I>acting on</I> their beliefs. It does nothing to prevent them 
  and the parents from holding those beliefs, or from conveying those beliefs to 
  others by any means that they think fit. Indeed, were the matter otherwise, 
  there would in this, or in any other case where particular behaviour is said 
  to be inspired by 'ideas' (the expression used in article 10), be no need or 
  room for investigation under article 9, or under article 2 of the first 
  protocol. The conduct could not in any event be prohibited, because in article 
  10 terms it expressed the idea that encouraged it. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Wider considerations</I></P>
  <LI value=85><A name=para85>The Secretary of State made no attempt, either 
  before Elias J or before us, to justify the provisions of section 548 should 
  they be held to be <I>prima facie</I> inconsistent with the requirements of 
  the Convention, whether under article 9(2) or in more general terms. In the 
  event, because article 9(1) is not engaged, that diffidence does not affect 
  the outcome of the appeal. I will therefore do no more than say that in 
  another case there may be much to be said as to the justification of elements 
  in the state's educational provision that conflict with particular religious 
  beliefs, whether Christian or otherwise; and that therefore, unhappily, this

  <P><I>Introduction</I></P>
  <LI value=87><A name=para87>The European Convention of Human Rights protects 
  rights of religious conscience and practice in two articles, article 9 and 
  article 2 of the First Protocol. Section 13 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the 
  "HRA 1998") underlines the importance of such rights. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=88><A name=para88>Article 9 provides as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
    religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and 
    freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, 
    to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and 
    observance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be 
    subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary 
    in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the 
    protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the 
    rights and freedoms of others."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=89><A name=para89>Article 2 of the First Protocol further provides: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"No person shall be denied the right to education. In the 
    exercise of any functions that it assumes in relation to education and to 
    teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such 
    education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and 
    philosophical convictions."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=90><A name=para90>Section 13 of the HRA 1998 provides: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"If a court's determination of any question arising under this 
    Act might affect the exercise by a religious organisation (itself or its 
    members) of the Convention right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
    religion, it must have particular regard to the importance of that 
  right."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=91><A name=para91>The issue in this appeal is whether section 548, 
  as amended, of the Education Act 1996, in extending the prohibition on the 
  infliction of corporal punishment in schools to independent schools, violates 
  the appellants' rights under these provisions of the Convention, as supported 
  by section 13 of the HRA 1998. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=92><A name=para92>There are three points I would like to make by way 
  of introduction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=93><A name=para93>The first relates to the nature and importance of 
  the freedoms of thought, conscience and religion guaranteed by the articles 
  cited above. It is best done by reference to the words used by the ECtHR 
  itself in <I>Kokkanakis v. Greece</I> (1993) 17 EHRR 397: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"31. As enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience 
    and religion is one of the foundations of a 'democratic society' within the 
    meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the 
    most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and of 
    their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, 
    agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a 
    democratic society, which has been dearly one over the centuries, depends on 
    it." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=94><A name=para94>In terms of what has been described as the 
  <I>forum internum</I> these freedoms are absolute. Thus the qualification 
  introduced by article 9(2) relates only to the freedom to manifest one's 
  religion or belief and not to the opening words of article 9(1). The right to 
  manifest one's religion or belief, although qualified under article 9(2), is 
  an inevitable extension of the absolute freedoms, since the right to believe 
  would be worth little without a right to act on that belief. One of the 
  aspects of the right to manifest which is specifically protected is that of 
  doing so in teaching. The point is also addressed in article 2 of the First 
  Protocol so far as the state's obligation to respect the right of parents to 
  ensure education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and 
  philosophical convictions is concerned. However, it is when beliefs are acted 
  upon that they begin to impinge upon other people: hence the need to qualify 
  the right to manifest, so that a proper balance may be maintained in a 
  democratic and pluralist society. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=95><A name=para95>Secondly, however, it is impossible to shut one's 
  eyes to the great dangers which exist and have always existed in the very 
  potency of religious belief and in its potential for conflict. <I>Tantum 
  religio potuit suadere malorum</I> was the comment of a classical poet 
  (Lucretius, De Rerum Natura, I. 101). Strasbourg jurisprudence does not 
  perhaps address this danger directly, but it is nevertheless reasonably clear 
  from the authorities which this court has been required to consider that a 
  number of techniques have been developed to hold in check the freedoms granted 
  by the articles under consideration. Thus, (1) the ECtHR has had to consider 
  what constitutes a philosophical conviction for the purpose of article 2 of 
  the First Protocol, and has concluded that it must attain a certain level of 
  "cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance" and must also be worthy of 
  respect in a democratic society and not be incompatible with human dignity: 
  <I>Campbell and Cosans v. United Kingdom </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1983/3.html">(1982) 4 EHRR 293</a> at para 36. (2) 
  A distinction has been drawn between an act which manifests or expresses a 
  belief and one that is merely motivated by it: <I>Arrowsmith v. United Kingdom 
  </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/7.html">(1978) 3 EHRR 218</a>. (3) A doctrine of non-interference has been used to 
  reject the engagement of article 9 in circumstances where the matter 
  complained about has not materially impacted on the complainant's rights: see, 
  for instance, <I>Jewish Liturgical Association Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. 
  France</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/351.html">(2000) 9 BHRC 27</a>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=96><A name=para96>In the present case the Secretary of State 
  employed the second of these techniques, and argued that the appellants would 
  not be manifesting or expressing their religious belief in seeking to 
  implement a policy of corporal punishment at school but were merely being 
  motivated by that belief. The judge accepted that submission and the 
  appellants seek to reverse that finding. However the Secretary of State's 
  primary argument, also accepted by the judge, adopted none of the techniques 
  listed above, but was rather to the effect that the appellants' belief, albeit 
  accepted as a genuine one, was not a <I>religious</I> belief. No case in 
  Strasbourg jurisprudence has been brought to our attention in which this 
  argument has been adopted. The appellants submit that the judge was in error 
  in this respect as well. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=97><A name=para97>At a late stage of these proceedings this court of 
  its own motion asked the parties to consider a line of Strasbourg 
  jurisprudence, conveniently but possibly somewhat inaccurately described as 
  the <I>Kalaç v. Turkey </I>(1997) 27 EHRR 552 line of authority, which had not 
  been previously cited by them but which deals with inter alia the doctrine of 
  non-interference referred to at (3) above. The court was concerned to have the 
  parties' submissions on the nature and ramifications of this doctrine in the 
  light of evidence from the appellants already before the court to the effect 
  of the parents' personal involvement in the application of the policy of 
  corporal punishment adopted at the schools in question. This was because 
  section 548, while removing from teachers any defence "by virtue of [their] 
  position as such" based on the application of no more than reasonable 
  chastisement, made no amendment in the availability of that defence to 
  parents. As a result, a further substantial hearing took place at which this 
  line of authority was considered. For the purpose of that hearing, the 
  appellants submitted further material as to the involvement of parents in the 
  process. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=98><A name=para98>In the event, I have come to the conclusion that 
  the doctrine of non-interference does apply in this case and that the appeal 
  should be dismissed on that ground, but on that ground only. Had it not been 
  for this new point, it would have been necessary to consider whether section 
  548, which I am satisfied for the reasons given by Buxton LJ does, on its 
  ordinary construction, prohibit corporal punishment by teachers operating the 
  schemes represented by the appellants' evidence, could nevertheless be 
  construed pursuant to section 3(1) of the HRA 1998 in such a way as to permit 
  them. Although the court has not heard developed argument as to how section 
  548 might be read down pursuant to section 3(1), it was common ground between 
  the parties that, if necessary, it could be. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=99><A name=para99>Thirdly, I would wish to express my profound 
  gratitude to Buxton LJ and Arden LJ, whose judgments I have read in draft with 
  admiration, for the assistance I have derived from them in clarifying my own 
  thoughts. I am in substantial (albeit not total) agreement with Arden LJ, and 
  regret to disagree with many of the conclusions of Buxton LJ, but I have 
  derived illumination from them both in equal measure. My appreciation and 
  gratitude is also due to Elias J for his judgment, despite my disagreements 
  with it. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Corporal punishment at school</I></P>
  <LI value=100><A name=para100>In his judgment below, Elias J made the 
  preliminary point that the court is not concerned with the merits of the 
  underlying dispute in the sense that it is not concerned to ask whether it 
  considers corporal punishment in schools to be desirable or undesirable. That 
  question of course has been answered in this country by Parliament's 
  legislation, and subject to the requirements of the Convention and the HRA 
  1998 it is certainly no business of the courts to second-guess Parliament. In 
  the European Court, however, there has been no hesitation on the part of 
  judges from expressing a restrained antipathy to corporal punishment in 
  schools: see, for instance, para 36 of the judgment of the majority of the 
  Court in <I>Costello-Roberts v. United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/16.html">(1993) 19 EHRR 112</a> at 135 
  as well as the partly dissenting opinions and the concurring opinion in that 
  case at 137/138. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=101><A name=para101>Despite the apparent antipathy for corporal 
  punishment in schools identifiable in the opinions of the judges of the 
  European Court, that Court has not ruled that it is unacceptable in principle, 
  even if its exercise is closely guarded under the provisions of the 
  Convention's article 3. There is no complaint on the part of the Secretary of 
  State that article 3 is engaged in the present case. Nevertheless, it is as 
  well to bear in mind that, as the judge below and Buxton LJ have remarked, the 
  law is not neutral about the imposition of physical force and requires it to 
  be justified. In the past, corporal punishment in schools has been justifiable 
  in this country, and parental corporal punishment in the home remains so 
  provided it amounts to no more than reasonable chastisement. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=102><A name=para102>Nor has Strasbourg jurisprudence outlawed 
  corporal punishment at home, although there too it will be closely guarded 
  under article 3: see <I>A v. United Kingdom</I> (1998) 27 EHRR 61. I agree 
  with the further comments made by Arden LJ in paras 242/244 and 311 of her 
  judgment. No reliance has been placed by the Secretary of State on the United 
  Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. </A>

  <LI value=103><A name=para103>I refer to the facts set out in the judgments of

  emphasise the following elements. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=104><A name=para104>The appellants claim in their evidence that it 
  is part of their fundamental Christian religious beliefs that physical 
  discipline should be administered, if and when appropriate, as an integral 
  part of the teaching and education of their children, whether in school or in 
  the home. They also believe, not surprisingly in view of their religious 
  approach, that such discipline is efficacious, but that is not what 
  principally drives their concern. The setting for their beliefs can perhaps 
  best be demonstrated by quoting from the Admission Statement of one of the 
  schools concerned, viz:- </A>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Corporal punishment…is never administered with the aim of 
    humiliation, but to minister justice, forgiveness and reconciliation. In

  <LI value=106><A name=para106>Citations from the Proverbs are provided by the

  precepts. A typical parental letter reads as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"As a Christian it is important to me that my children are

    of every action, good or bad, and that corporal discipline has a place in 
    the disciplinary options of schools."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=107><A name=para107>The evidence also makes it plain that corporal 
  punishment is rarely resorted to, only after careful consideration of all the 
  circumstances of the case, and when thought necessary, mildly applied.

  is not any teacher who may perform the punishment, but only head teachers or 
  selected members of staff. </A>

  <LI value=109><A name=para109>No evidence to the contrary has been served on 
  behalf of the Secretary of State. The evidence given for the appellants is 
  contained in or annexed to the witness statement of one deponent, Mr Philip 
  Williamson, the head teacher of the Christian Fellowship School, Liverpool: 
  but it is clear that he speaks there for the appellants as a whole, who 
  comprise head teachers, teachers and parents at his and other schools, as well 
  as for other parents who are not named as litigants in these proceedings but 
  whose views are demonstrated in the material annexed to his statement. There 
  is no evidence that the appellants ever have in the past or are likely in the 
  future to transgress the limitations which they have imposed on themselves in 
  the exercise of their belief. Thus it is not suggested that the appellants' 
  claims to authorise a scheme of corporal punishment which is mild, loving and 
  responsibly administered are incorrect. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The scope of the debate</I></P>
  <LI value=110><A name=para110>It is important at this point to emphasise the 
  limited scope of the debate undertaken both before the judge and again on this 
  appeal. No case has been raised on appeal on behalf of the Secretary of State 
  under article 9(2), even as a fall-back position, to the effect that the 
  extension of the ambit of section 548 to independent schools is "necessary in 
  a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of 
  public order, health or morals or for the protection of the rights and 
  freedoms of others". That contrasts with the position before the judge, where 
  the Secretary of State did contend that section 548 was justified under 
  article 9(2), albeit as a mere submission and without any evidence and only as 
  a final and fall-back submission. The judge rejected that submission in the 
  following terms: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Finally, Mr. Keith for the Secretary of State contended that 
    even if I were to find an infringement of Article 9, I should nonetheless 
    find the provision justified under Article 9(2). Had I found against the 
    Secretary of State under Article 9(1), I would have been unwilling to take 
    that step. It may be that in exceptional cases the potential harm resulting 
    from the manifestation of a belief will be so plain that it is obvious on 
    what grounds the state has banned it. However, that is not the case here. It 
    is not even as if all corporal punishment is being treated as unlawful, only 
    that practised in schools. I have no evidence that it was ever appreciated 
    that the banning of corporal punishment might conflict with the parents' 
    human rights. Moreover even if that were appreciated, I have no evidence 
    before me as to why it was felt justifiable to interfere with such rights. 
    Without such evidence, it is impossible to say whether the response was a 
    proportionate one. The court cannot find justification simply on the basis 
    of counsel's assertion as to possible grounds which a state might be able to 
    rely upon to justify the provisions in question."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=111><A name=para111>There has been no respondent's notice nor any 
  attempt on this appeal to resurrect that submission. On the contrary this 
  court was informed by Mr Hugo Keith, who appears on behalf of the Secretary of 
  State, that the decision not to invoke article 9(2) on appeal had been a 
  considered and deliberate one. Thus there is no suggestion that the statutory 
  provision complained of is necessary in a democratic society to protect the 
  rights and freedoms of children. Article 2 of the First Protocol has no 
  similar express limitation on the rights granted by it, but, to the extent 
  that there may be implicit in it any similar limitation in favour of the 
  necessity to protect the rights and freedoms of children, or any inherent 
  qualification to the effect that only religious or philosophical convictions 
  which are worthy of respect in a democratic society or are compatible with 
  human dignity qualify as convictions within the meaning of the article, no 
  real case to the effect that the beliefs of the appellants would be excluded 
  on that ground has been made on behalf of the Secretary of State. Nor has any 
  argument been advanced that there is no failure to "respect" parents' rights 
  under that article because the State's interference with any such right is not 
  disproportionate. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=112><A name=para112>The furthest that Mr Keith has gone is to remind 
  the court by reference to decisions of the European Court on article 3, such 
  as <I>Costello-Roberts v. United Kingdom </I>(see at para 100 above) and 
  <I>Tyrer v. United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/2.html">(1978) 2 EHRR 1</a> (see its para 33), that that 
  article is designed to protect a person's dignity and physical integrity. 
  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the ECtHR has never ruled that all 
  corporal punishment of children, or even all corporal punishment in schools, 
  falls within the prohibition of article 3 as being "degrading"; nor that any 
  other right of children protected by the Convention has been violated by 
  corporal punishment which does not infringe article 3. Nor did the Secretary 
  of State make any submission to the contrary. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=113><A name=para113>It follows that the real battle-ground both 
  below and in this court has not been the important and wide-ranging argument 
  which might have been advanced, to the effect that, whatever might be said of, 
  for or against, the mild and loving application of physical punishment to 
  children in an institutionalised setting, a government ought to be entitled to 
  legislate against all corporal punishment in schools, on an ultimate balance 
  of the competing rights and interests involved. Such an argument would be 
  prepared to take account on the one side of the rights and interests of 
  parents in passing to the next generation the beliefs, religious and 
  philosophical, which help to guide their lives, and on the other side of the 
  rights and interests of children to be free of the dangers that can stem from 
  the permission of any leeway at all in the matter of corporal punishment; and 
  on a third side of the rights and interests of the democratic State, as the 
  representative of all the competing values and interests in society, to 
  legislate in a way that it believes best, most safely, justly and 
  proportionately preserves the rights and interests of all concerned. That, as 
  I say, has not been the argument in this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=114><A name=para114>Instead, the argument has been a much narrower 
  and more formal but in its way equally important argument about the nature of 
  religious belief itself. The Secretary of State has argued, to put his central 
  thesis as succinctly as I can, that neither article 9 nor article 2 of the 
  First Protocol is engaged at all, because the appellants' belief, genuine as 
  it is accepted to be, and sincerely based as it is also accepted to be on what 
  is seen by the appellants as their Christian religious belief, nevertheless is 
  not a matter of religion or religious belief at all, nor a religious 
  conviction, at any rate for the purposes of the Convention. Nor is the 
  practice of a system of corporal punishment according to such a belief a 
  manifestation of such a belief, as distinct from something motivated by such a 
  belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=115><A name=para115>I have called this an important argument, and so 
  I think it is, for it proceeds, if correct, by denying to such a belief any of 
  the protections which the Convention grants to religious conscience and 
  practice. Conscience is not a matter of counting heads. Minority beliefs need 
  protection. Of course, a claim to hold a religious belief does not make it so. 
  But how is one to recognise a belief of a religious nature which on the one 
  hand is or on the other hand is not a belief or religious conviction for the 
  purpose of the Convention? One person's creed is another's anathema. Moreover, 
  a person's religion or religious belief, perhaps more than any other kind of 
  belief, may inform and affect his or her whole life. Thought, conscience, 
  religion, and the transference and demonstration of values are all inseparably 
  entwined with action. The Convention recognises the value of freedom of 
  thought, conscience and religion and the right to transfer such values to a 
  new generation. There are also the dangers I have spoken of above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=116><A name=para116>Speaking for myself, I am unhappy that the 
  argument has taken this narrow, however important, path. It has deprived the 
  court of the richness and assistance of authorities from other jurisdictions 
  which have had to grapple with the wider argument. As an example of such 
  authorities I would merely mention two, albeit they deal with different (but 
  possibly relevant) constitutional texts: <I>Employment Division, Department of 
  Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I> 494 US 872 (1990) and <I>Christian 
  Education South Africa v. Minister of Education</I> [2001] 1 LRC 441, 9 BHRC 
  53. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The judgment below</I></P>
  <LI value=117><A name=para117>The judge proceeded (at para 39 of his judgment) 
  by asking himself two principal questions, as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"First, is the desire to have one's child potentially subject to 
    corporal punishment properly described as a religious belief (Article 9) or 
    conviction (Article 2 of the First Protocol)? Second, if not, is it in any 
    event the manifestation of a belief or a practice which is in conformity 
    with [a religious] conviction and which has been unlawfully interfered 
  with?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=118><A name=para118>The judge's approach therefore was to ask 
  himself questions which spanned the separate articles of the Convention under 
  consideration and to some extent conflated their language. There is 
  considerable value in that approach, for as the ECtHR noted in both 
  <I>Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1976/6.html">1 EHRR 711</a> (at para 52) 
  and<I> Valsamis v. Greece</I> 24 EHRR 397 (at para 25): </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"the two sentences of Article 2 [of Protocol No. 1] must be read 
    not only in the light of each other but also, in particular, of Articles 8, 
    9 and 10 of the Convention…".</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=119><A name=para119>The judge's answers to his two questions were as 
  follows. As to the first, he took <I>Campbell and Cosans v. United Kingdom 
  </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1983/3.html">4 EHRR 293</a> as his principal authority. He referred to the ECtHR's view (at 
  para 36) that "beliefs" (in the French text <I>convictions</I>) in article 9 
  and "convictions" in article 2 of the First Protocol were akin in meaning, and 
  could be contrasted with mere "opinions" and "ideas", concepts found in 
  article 10. He then cited and adopted the ECtHR's understanding of 
  "philosophical convictions" as denoting – </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"such convictions as are worthy of respect in a 'democratic 
    society' and are not incompatible with human 
  dignity"(<I>ibid</I>).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=120><A name=para120>In an extended passage cited in Buxton LJ's 
  judgment at para 56 above the judge then appears to have argued as follows. He 
  contrasted the "philosophical conviction" in issue and accepted as such in 
  <I>Campbell and Cosans</I>, ie the conviction <I>against</I> the use of 
  corporal punishment in schools, with the candidate in issue in the present 
  case, ie the alleged belief <I>in favour of</I> corporal punishment in 
  schools, and remarked that because the latter involves an intentional assault 
  it requires a stronger case to justify it. At that stage the reader is 
  prepared for an analysis of whether such a belief is worthy of respect in a 
  democratic society and is compatible with human dignity. Such an analysis, 
  however, does not occur. On the contrary, the judge states that a belief that 
  corporal punishment should be imposed cannot "properly be…described" as a 
  philosophical or religious conviction and adds that "This has got nothing to 
  do with the genuineness of the belief <I>or its intrinsic merits</I>" (my 
  emphasis) but rather with its "nature or character". Thus the belief's 
  intrinsic merits are not in question. The reason why the belief cannot be 
  treated as a philosophical conviction is then given: it is because – </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Nobody suggests that the corporal punishment should 
    automatically be applied to all children as a matter of principle. For some 
    children it may never be necessary. It is envisaged that it will be needed 
    only for rare cases of relatively serious indiscipline. The parents wish it 
    to be administered in such circumstances because they consider it to be a 
    more efficacious method of securing appropriate discipline. I do not think 
    that it is appropriate to describe a belief that one measure is more 
    effective than another as a philosophical or religious conviction even if 
    the reason for holding that belief is that it is supported by a religious 
    text."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=121><A name=para121>In giving that reason I am concerned that the 
  judge may have mischaracterised the appellants' belief and, critically, 
  emptied it of the religious content that they espouse. As I read their 
  evidence, they are not motivated by a merely utilitarian view as to the 
  efficacy of corporal punishment, but by a religious view that regards the 
  proper exercise and bearing of punishment, including corporal punishment, as 
  part of the training for and ultimately living of a godly life. Like the 
  judge, I am not dealing with the merits of that position. But I believe that 
  the appellants have no hope of having that position taken seriously for the 
  purposes of the Convention if it is represented simply as a view as to "a more 
  efficacious method of securing appropriate discipline". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=122><A name=para122>At the end of the passage cited above the judge 
  reverts to acknowledging the religious basis for the appellants' belief, 
  although he has already characterised that belief in the way considered above 
  and does not recognise the appellants' basis for it other than in terms of the 
  fact that the belief is "supported by a religious text". The belief therefore 
  remains a utilitarian belief, albeit one supported by a religious text. He 
  then seems to me to consider a new aspect of the argument, which is to ask 
  what status to accord to such religious texts. He reasons: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is not one of the articles of faith. It may be accurate to 
    say that someone has a religious conviction that everything in the Bible is 
    true, but it would surely be odd to describe, say, a belief in angels as a 
    religious conviction or as itself constituting an article of religious 
    faith. It is a belief which is in accordance with the religious faith, but 
    it does not embody or define the belief or conviction itself."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=123><A name=para123>The question, of course, is not what the status 
  of a belief in angels is: but the argument proceeds by distinguishing between 
  the belief in issue, which is accorded a distinct and subsidiary status, and 
  on the other hand an "article of faith" or belief which embodies or defines 
  religious faith (or embodies or defines a belief or conviction of religious 
  faith?), which is accorded a higher status. I am concerned that a secular 
  court is ill equipped for such distinctions. I am concerned that it is not 
  only ill equipped, but that it lacks in this case the conventional means by 
  which it would normally proceed to make such distinctions, which is evidence. 
  I am in any event uneasy about the efficacy of such evidence: one of the 
  problems of religion is the diversity of belief even within the umbrella of a 
  single faith. I am also sceptical that such distinctions would give correct 
  answers about beliefs arising out of religions other than Christianity. The 
  practice of Judaism, for instance may be said to depend in large part not 
  merely on faith but on a law based or developed obligation to obey God's 
  commands. Thus I do not think that circumcision, or the dietary laws, could be 
  correctly (or other than metaphorically) referred to as an "article of faith" 
  of Judaism or Islam, although they are regarded as divine commandments. It is 
  hard to conceive, however, that Jews or Muslims could be prevented from 
  manifesting their religion or belief in such respects without an engagement of 
  Convention rights. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=124><A name=para124>The judge concludes (in his para 46) by 
  reverting to the belief in issue. He accepts that it <I>is</I> a "belief" 
  ("genuinely and strongly held"), but not that it is a religious conviction. He 
  repeats that it is a belief as to the "efficacy" of corporal punishment. He 
  then says: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Corporal punishment is not being invoked for its own sake but 
    in order to help secure the religious convictions that underpin the 
    Christian convictions of these families. Accordingly I do not accept that 
    the belief in the desirability of corporal punishment, even though it is 
    derived from the Christian convictions held by these parents, can properly 
    be defined as a religious conviction in its own right."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=125><A name=para125>In that first sentence the judge comes, for the 
  first time in this passage, closest to expressing the appellants' case, but it 
  seems to come too late to make an impression on the argument. It also appears 
  to be crucial that corporal punishment is not invoked "for its own sake". The 
  same might possibly be said about keeping the sabbath, save that that is also 
  made the subject of an express biblical commandment, in this case one of the 
  Ten Commandments. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=126><A name=para126>I would pay genuine respect to the reasoning of 
  the judge, approved as it is in its essence if not in all its aspects by 
  Buxton LJ; but in my judgment it proceeds from a mischaracterisation of the 
  appellants' case. On that basis the judge is unwilling to accord to the 
  appellants' genuine and strongly held belief, founded in their Christian 
  faith, the status of a religious conviction. It is not the intrinsic merits of 
  their belief, but its nature or character which for him determine that 
  conclusion. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=127><A name=para127>In the circumstances I am concerned that the 
  judge may have erred in his answer to his first question. On behalf of the 
  appellants Mr Paul Diamond submitted that to proceed down the path of 
  speculating on the merits or nature of the appellants' Christian faith was a 
  false and dangerous turning. I do not think that the judge did, in the end, 
  consider the <I>merits</I> of the appellants' belief, but he did seek to 
  evaluate its nature and character. This seems to me to raise most difficult 
  and troublesome questions. How is a court to evaluate a claim to a religious 
  basis for someone's belief? Not all faiths follow familiar forms, and even 
  within a single umbrella faith there are minority views, some of an extreme 
  fundamentalist kind. And is it true that merits play no role in the 
  evaluation? The judge seems to have trembled on the brink of making that 
  evaluation, at any rate in contrasting the belief in question in this case 
  with its counterpart in question in <I>Campbell and Cosans</I>. What is to 
  happen if a religious belief or conviction flies in the face of what is worthy 
  of respect in a democratic society or is incompatible with human dignity? I 
  shall revert to such questions below. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=128><A name=para128>The judge's second question (see para 117 above) 
  asked whether the exercise of corporal punishment in schools was a 
  manifestation of a belief or conviction. As posed, the question assumed that 
  the answer to the first question was that the belief in corporal punishment 
  was <I>not</I> a religious belief or conviction within the meaning of article 
  9 or article 2 of the First Protocol. I confess to finding the form of this 
  question puzzling. It is not clear to me how it could be answered positively 
  where the first question had been answered in the negative, which was exactly 
  the answer assumed in the second question. It may simply be that the judge's 
  "if not" is an error for "if so". In any event the judge reasoned as follows 
  (at paras 53/4 of his judgment), basing himself on <I>Valsamis v. Greece</I>: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In my view the refusal to permit the sanction of corporal 
    punishment cannot fairly be described as an act of indoctrination that fails 
    to respect the parents' religious and philosophical convictions. The 
    children are in no sense being indoctrinated; their beliefs remain 
    untarnished…In my view this case shows that not every interference to which 
    religious objection can be made will amount to an infringement of the 
    Convention..."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=129><A name=para129>It seems to me that there the judge is answering 
  a different question, one related not so much to article 9's concept of the 
  manifestation of a person's religion or belief as to article 2's concept of 
  the State's need to respect the right of parents in the education of their 
  children. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=130><A name=para130>There still remains the separate question, 
  highlighted in the judge's second question, whether the exercise of corporal 
  punishment is a <I>manifestation</I> of religion or belief. The judge reaches 
  that question in para 54 of his judgment by reference to <I>Arrowsmith v. 
  United Kingdom </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/7.html">3 EHRR 218</a> and the distinction between an action motivated 
  by belief as distinct from an action manifesting belief. Thus the judge 
  reasoned: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Similarly here: sending one's child to an environment in which 
    corporal punishment is permitted for disciplinary misdemeanours is an action 
    which is motivated by the belief but it is not in my judgment a 
    manifestation of the belief itself. It is not the outward manifestation in 
    observance or practice of the fundamental tenets of the religion such as 
    will occur during religious services or even when seeking to convert others 
    to one's beliefs. It is an action which, put at its highest, is designed to 
    reinforce a respect for the religious values involved rather than being a 
    manifestation of those values."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>It can be observed that buried in that reasoning is a continuing 
  distinction between "the fundamental tenets of the religion" and other beliefs 
  or values. In other words, if "if not" is to be altered to "if so" in the 
  judge's question, he has not remained faithful to his hypothesis.</P>
  <P><I>The authorities</I></P>
  <LI value=131><A name=para131>I think it is helpful to set out in their 
  chronological order the six leading Strasbourg authorities originally cited to 
  the court, even though both articles in issue are not equally under 
  consideration in each of them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=132><A name=para132>The earliest, decided in 1976, is <I>Kjeldsen, 
  Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1976/6.html">1 EHRR 711</a>. The applicants objected to 
  a Danish law which made sex education in schools compulsory. The issue 
  therefore was as to the positive content of the educational curriculum 
  required by the State. On such an issue the ECtHR's judgment naturally 
  concentrated on article 2 of the First Protocol. The essence of the Court's 
  reasoning is contained in the following passages from paras 50 and 53 of its 
  judgment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Furthermore, the second sentence of Article 2 must be read 
    together with the first which enshrines the right of everyone to education. 
    It is on to this fundamental right that is grafted the right of parents to 
    respect for their religious and philosophical convictions… </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The second sentence of Article 2 aims in short at safeguarding 
    the possibility of pluralism in education, which possibility is essential 
    for the preservation of the 'democratic society' as conceived by the 
    Convention. In view of the power of the modern State, it is above all 
    through State teaching that this aim must be realised…</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It follows…that the setting and planning of the curriculum fall 
    in principle within the competence of the Contracting States. This mainly 
    involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule 
    and whose solution may legitimately vary according to the country and the 
    era. In particular, the second sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol does 
    not prevent States from imparting through teaching or education information 
    or knowledge of a directly or indirectly religious or philosophical kind. It 
    does not even permit parents to object to the integration of such teaching 
    or education in the school curriculum, for otherwise all institutionalised 
    teaching would run the risk of proving impracticable…</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The second sentence of Article 2 implies on the other hand that 
    the State, in fulfilling the functions assumed by it in regard to education 
    and teaching, must take care that information or knowledge included in the 
    curriculum is conveyed in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner. The 
    State is forbidden to pursue an aim of indoctrination that might be 
    considered as not respecting parents' religious and philosophical 
    convictions. That is the limit that must not be exceeded." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=133><A name=para133>As for article 9, the ECtHR merely said that it

  <LI value=134><A name=para134><I>Arrowsmith v. United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/7.html">3 EHRR 218</a>

  Commission. Ms Arrowsmith was a pacifist who had distributed leaflets to 
  British soldiers at an army camp in England calling on them to decline duty in 
  Northern Ireland. In her application she complained that her conviction under 
  the Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934 was a violation of article 9, since it 
  interfered with her right to manifest her pacifist belief in practice. The 
  Commission disagreed. Critically, it found (para 75) that </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"the leaflets did not express pacifist views. The Commission 
    considers, therefore, that the applicant, by distributing the leaflets, did 
    not manifest her belief in the sense of Article 9(1)."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=135><A name=para135>It was in this context that the Commission had

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is true that public declarations proclaiming generally the

  the parents of two boys at state schools. They complained that the system of 
  corporal punishment at their sons' schools violated article 3 and article 2 of 
  the First Protocol. Their complaint was upheld under article 2 only. In that 
  respect their case was that they had a philosophical conviction against the 
  use of corporal punishment. The essence of the Court's reasoning is contained 
  in the headnote, with references to paragraphs in the judgment, as follows: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(a) Although the use of corporal punishment in schools may be a 
    matter of internal administration or merely ancillary to education and 
    training, it is an integral part of the process whereby a school seeks to 
    develop and mould the character and mental powers of its pupils and it 
    cannot be said to fall outside the scope of Article 2 of Protocol No 1 
  [33].</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(b) Although the power to use corporal punishment is vested in 
    teachers by the common law and is not delegated by the State, discipline is 
    an integral part of any educational system and the functions assumed by the 
    State in formulating general policy in State schools must be taken to extend 
    to questions of discipline in general [34]. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(c) The obligation to respect religions [sic] and philosophical 
    convictions under Article 2 of Protocol No 1 is not confined to the content 
    of educational instruction or the mode of conveying information and 
    knowledge but includes the organisation and financing of public education, 
    the supervision of the educational system in question and questions of 
    discipline [35].</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <LI value=137><A name=para137>That case was not concerned with religious

  <LI value=139><A name=para139><I>Seven Individuals v. Sweden</I> (Application 
  No 8811/79) is a 1982 decision of the Commission. The applicants were members 
  of a Protestant free church congregation who complained about a section in 
  Sweden's "Code of Parenthood" which stated that "The child shall not be 
  subjected to corporal punishment or any other form of humiliating treatment". 
  They justified their belief in corporal punishment by the use of biblical 
  texts. The Commission decided that there was no breach of articles 8 or 9 on 
  the ground that there was no interference by the State in the rights 
  guaranteed by those articles. The Commission's reasoning in this respect was 
  expounded under the consideration of article 8 and there was no separate 
  consideration of the wording of article 9. The essence of the reasoning 
  appears to be that the Code contained no sanction; by prohibiting and thus 
  discouraging <I>any </I>corporal punishment it was merely designed to prevent 
  <I>excessive</I> punishment which would amount to a criminal assault; and 
  there was no evidence that the Code's prohibition of even light corporal 
  rebukes had led to any change in the criminal law or to any prosecutions for 
  such light rebukes or indeed any effect at all on the applicants. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=140><A name=para140>The Commission also decided that there was no

  reasoned as follows: </A>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the present case the Commission has found that no

    respondent Government to implement a policy of indoctrination in Swedish 
    schools, have failed to show that their right to respect for their religious

  1993 decision of the ECtHR on article 9. The applicant there was a Jehovah's 
  witness who had been convicted under a Greek law against proselytism. The 
  Court held that there had been a breach of article 9 and that for the purposes 
  of article 9(2) the Greek law went further than was necessary in a democratic 
  society. Under the heading of "General Principles" the ECtHR had this to say 
  about the importance and width of article 9 (I have already cited at para 93 
  above from the beginning of this passage): </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"31. As enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience 
    and religion is one of the foundations of a 'democratic society' within the 
    meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the 
    most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and of 
    their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, 
    agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a 
    democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on 
    it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual 
    conscience, it also implies, <I>inter alia</I>, freedom to 'manifest [one's] 
    religion'. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence 
    of religious convictions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>According to Article 9, freedom to manifest one's religion is 
    not only exercisable in community with others, 'in public' and within the 
    circle of those whose faith one shares, but can also be asserted 'alone' and 
    'in private'…</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"33. The fundamental nature of the rights guaranteed in Article 
    9(1) is also reflected in the wording of the paragraph providing for 
    limitations on them. Unlike the second paragraphs of Articles 8, 10 and 11, 
    which cover all the rights mentioned in the first paragraphs of those 
    Articles, that of Article 9 refers only to 'freedom to manifest one's 
    religion or belief.' In doing so, it recognises that in democratic 
    societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same 
    population, it may be necessary to place restrictions on this freedom in 
    order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that 
    everyone's beliefs are respected."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=144><A name=para144>For the purposes of its consideration of 
  Greece's defence under article 9(2) the ECtHR was prepared to consider 
  evidence relating to what it called the distinction between "true evangelism" 
  and "improper proselytism" (see para 48). In this connection it derived 
  assistance from a 1956 report drawn up under the auspices of the World Council 
  of Churches. If the Greek law had gone no further than punishing improper 
  proselytism, then there would have been no breach of article 9. </A>

  <LI value=145><A name=para145>The most recent case in this series is 
  <I>Valsamis v. Greece</I> 24 EHRR 292, another decision of the ECtHR, given in 
  1996, which the judge found of assistance. There the applicants were three 
  Jehovah's witnesses, parents and their daughter. The daughter had suffered a 
  one day suspension from school because she had refused to take part in a 
  school parade on the occasion of Greece's National Day. The applicants 
  complained of breaches of article 9 and of article 2 of the First Protocol in 
  that the daughter's refusal was premised on religious (pacifist) objections to 
  participating in a parade on a day which commemorated the outbreak of war 
  between Greece and fascist Italy. The ECtHR reviewed principles which it had 
  stated in its decisions referred to above but did not consider it necessary to 
  add to them. It appears to have taken for granted that the applicants' 
  religious pacifist convictions were entitled to respect but found on the facts 
  that nothing had occurred which could have offended them, for – </A>

  <LI value=146><A name=para146>The ECtHR added that there was nothing to stop 
  the parents guiding their daughter in line with their own convictions. 
  Therefore there was no breach of article 2 of the First Protocol. As for 
  article 9, the argument was that it guaranteed the daughter's negative freedom 
  not to manifest by her support convictions contrary to her own. The Court 
  rejected the argument again on the facts, saying (at para 37): </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It has already held, in paragraphs 31-33 above, that the 
    obligation to take part in the school parade was not such as to offend her 
    parents' religious convictions. The impugned measure therefore did not 
    amount to an interference with her right to freedom of religion 
  either."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=147><A name=para147>In my judgment, <I>Valsamis </I>is a decision on 
  the facts and adds nothing to the principles of the earlier cases. No question 
  arose as to the meaning of religious convictions, beliefs, or the 
  manifestation of religion or belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=148><A name=para148>The last authority I should mention is one not 
  cited to the court, but to which Buxton LJ has referred at paras 29 and 34 
  above, namely <I>X v. United Kingdom </I>6 EHRR 558, a decision of the 
  Commission given in 1984. The applicant, a pacifist, there complained, in 
  reliance on article 9, that there was no procedure by which she could prevent 
  any portion of her income tax being used for military purposes, and that she 
  was being prevented from manifesting her belief that she should oppose 
  recourse to force in the settlement of disputes. The Commission, in its brief 
  reasoning, held the complaint to be manifestly ill-founded. Its principal 
  arguments (eg that the power to collect taxes was expressly recognised by 
  article 1 of the First Protocol, that the obligation to pay taxes is a general 
  one with no specific conscientious implications in itself, and that its 
  neutrality is illustrated by the fact that no tax payer can determine the 
  purpose for which his or her contributions are applied) were directed to the 
  conclusion that the obligation to pay involved no impingement on the freedoms 
  generated by article 9. However, the Commission also referred to its decision 
  in <I>Arrowsmith v UK</I>, and stated: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Art. 9 primarily protects the sphere of personal beliefs and 
    religious creeds, <I>ie</I> the area which is sometimes called the <I>forum 
    internum</I>. In addition, it protects acts which are intimately linked to 
    these attitudes, such as acts of worship or devotion which are aspects of 
    the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised 
  form."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I shall refer to this dictum below, because Buxton LJ has relied on it to 
  suggest that the area of manifestation of belief protected by article 9(1) is 
  a narrow or limited one and in any event sufficiently restricted to exclude 
  the appellants from reliance on it in this case.</P>
  <P><I>Discussion: the appellants' beliefs </I></P>
  <LI value=149><A name=para149>Although the two articles under consideration 
  have to be considered together, it is typical in Strasbourg jurisprudence to 
  deal in turn with a complaint raised in respect of each article invoked. I 
  shall seek to do the same, beginning, as in <I>Valsamis</I>, with article 2 of 
  the First Protocol which, after all, is specifically concerned with the need 
  for States to respect the right of parents to ensure education in conformity 
  with their own religious and philosophical convictions. Another advantage of 
  beginning with article 2 is that it enables me to start by considering whether 
  the appellants can rely on a religious conviction, before going on to consider 
  the question of manifestation of belief for the purposes of article 9. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=150><A name=para150>The judge did not accept that any religious 
  conviction was involved in this case, but I regret that I am unable to agree 
  with his reasoning, which I have considered in some detail above. It seems to 
  me that the difficulties I have with that reasoning are underlined by a 
  consideration of the Strasbourg jurisprudence. A "conviction" denotes views 
  that attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance 
  (<I>Campbell and Cosans</I> at para 36), but there has been no submission nor 
  any finding by the judge that the appellants' views in favour of a system of 
  punishment in schools which includes corporal punishment do not qualify as a 
  conviction for these purposes. One may profoundly disagree with the 
  appellants' views, but it seems hard to say that they are not cogent, serious, 
  cohesive and important, and there has been no attempt to submit that they are 
  not. I would agree that a person's mere <I>claim</I> to have a conviction, or 
  a religious conviction, does not make it a conviction or religious conviction. 
  Nevertheless, there is no evidence before the court to dispute their claim to 
  found their beliefs in orthodox Christianity. That view of what orthodox 
  Christianity entails may of course be a minority view, but there is no 
  evidence that it is not a legitimate, albeit minority, view. The Secretary of 
  State has not sought to place any evidence before the court, similar to the 
  World Council of Churches report in evidence in <I>Kokkinakis</I> (at para 
  48), to the effect that the appellants' view of the use of corporal punishment 
  in the education of children is an illegitimate perversion of Christian 
  belief. For these purposes it is necessary to accept for the purposes of the 
  argument the administration of corporal punishment as described by the 
  appellants and not disputed by the Secretary of State: that is to say, 
  corporal punishment only where rarely necessary and appropriate, only to a 
  mild degree, and exercised as part of a responsible and indeed loving approach 
  to the education of children in their duties to God and man. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=151><A name=para151>In <I>Campbell and Cosans</I> the ECtHR said 
  (<I>ibid</I>) that for a conviction to qualify as a "philosophical" conviction 
  it had to be worthy of respect in a democratic society and not be incompatible 
  with human dignity. It is not clear whether the same requirement is needed as 
  a test of a "religious" conviction. It may not be, for at any rate in the case 
  of established religions, it should be possible for the most part to speak 
  with some confidence of whether something is a religious conviction or not: 
  whereas philosophical secular convictions may be of a more personal and 
  idiosyncratic nature. At any rate, no case has been cited prior to this case 
  in which a claim to a religious conviction has been rejected. Of course, 
  religion is a controversial subject and there would be many who would argue 
  that undoubted religious convictions are not worthy of respect or are not 
  compatible with human dignity. It is in part to guard against such controversy 
  that the Convention guarantees religious freedom. The Commission's decision in 
  <I>Seven Individuals v. Sweden</I>, as far as it goes, would appear to be 
  unsympathetic to the idea that extraordinary or unusual elements of religious 
  doctrine or convictions which "conflict with the standards generally accepted 
  by other parents in respect of discipline" would be convictions unworthy of 
  protection under article 2. Nevertheless, there is of course a danger in 
  opening up the protection of the Convention to a wide range of practices that 
  a democracy may properly wish to control. Let me therefore assume that the 
  <I>Campbell and Cosans </I>test must apply to religious convictions as well as 
  philosophical convictions and is not merely a test which enters at the article 
  9(2) stage of justification. Even so, and bearing in mind that it takes more 
  to justify the imposition of violence than the prohibition of violence, I 
  cannot find in any Strasbourg jurisprudence any majority support, or in the 
  judge's judgment below any finding, that the regime of corporal punishment in 
  evidence in this case is not worthy of respect in a democratic society or is 
  incompatible with human dignity. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=152><A name=para152>To revert to <I>Campbell and Cosans</I>: in that 
  case it was held by the ECtHR that a belief against the use of corporal 
  punishment in schools qualified as a philosophical conviction. For reasons 
  already indicated in the course of commenting on that decision, and in the 
  light of the discussion immediately above, and on the evidence in this case, I 
  cannot see why the belief in favour of the use of corporal punishment in 
  schools as here described does not equally well qualify as a philosophical 
  conviction, and, indeed, because it is rooted in religious belief, as a 
  religious conviction. With genuine respect for the views of Elias J and Buxton 
  LJ, I am not satisfied that it is possible to avoid that conclusion by 
  characterising the belief in question as merely one as to efficacy. I do not 
  believe that that is an accurate characterisation on the evidence; and I am 
  concerned that such a downplaying of the appellants' belief, in a way that I 
  am confident that they would not recognise, would be a recipe in other cases 
  for emasculating the content of the rights protected by article 2, and, for 
  there is a connection with article 9 although the words there are "religion or 
  belief", the content of the rights protected by article 9 as well. The ECtHR 
  itself recognised in <I>Campbell and Cosans</I> that discipline was an 
  integral part of what it described as "the whole process" of education whereby 
  adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs and values to the young. Nor do I 
  think it ultimately helpful to describe the appellants' belief as one inspired 
  by but not part of religious faith. If this is another way of saying that 
  theirs is a belief merely as to efficacy, then the argument has not advanced. 
  If this is a way of saying that it is not "an article of faith", I am dubious 
  for reasons already given about the distinction sought to be drawn at any rate 
  in the context of the Convention rights, and, in any event, I lack the 
  evidence or inherent knowledge to make the distinction sought. It would be odd 
  if it was harder to establish a belief as a religious conviction for the 
  purposes of article 2, because it was not an article of faith, than to 
  establish a belief as a philosophical conviction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=153><A name=para153>I should at this point respectfully refer to a 
  new and powerful argument developed by Buxton LJ principally at paragraphs 21 
  to 24 and 62 to 68 above, which I think goes somewhat beyond the judge's 
  analysis. Buxton LJ there reasons that the appellants' evidence of religious 
  belief is itself wanting. In the first passage he leaves the point open, 
  describing the nature and basis of the appellants' belief and its connexion 
  with the regime which they espouse as elusive. In the second passage he 
  proceeds from scepticism to his conclusion that the appellants' lack any 
  religious belief or conviction within the protection of the Convention. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=154><A name=para154>One strand in his scepticism and ultimate 
  rejection of the appellants' claim is that there is what he describes as a gap 
  between their actual practice and the more far-reaching imperatives of the 
  scriptural authority by which those practices are justified. However, I do not 
  share his concern in this respect. It is of the nature of religious belief 
  that scriptural texts become the subject-matter for interpretation and 
  development down the ages. It cannot be right in principle that the Convention 
  should protect only the most fundamentalist or otherwise literal 
  interpretation or practice of religious texts. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=155><A name=para155>Another strand, and indeed the counterpoint to 
  the first, is his treatment of the general Christian message of love and 
  forgiveness as a possible explanation of the gap between text and practice 
  which he identifies. He says that such a message is too generalised and 
  undefined a position to count as a conviction or belief for the purposes of 
  the Convention. I would regret to think that was so, but in any event I do not 
  agree. For one thing, the fact that a sterner text is softened by the 
  application of Christian principle does not make the adherence to a text thus 
  reinterpreted any the less the matter of religious belief. For another thing, 
  I would not accept that the general doctrine of Christian love and forgiveness 
  is anything but cogent, serious, coherent and important. If need be, that 
  doctrine could be exemplified by specific texts: the fact that the doctrine 
  can be generalised is not, after all, a weakness but evidence of the strength 
  of the overall message, the power of which is recognised throughout the world. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=156><A name=para156>I revert, therefore, to my earlier concerns. In 
  my judgment the insistence of the Secretary of State in arguing this appeal on 
  the narrow ground of whether the appellants are even motivated by a 
  <I>religious belief or conviction</I> (the additional question of whether they 
  <I>manifest</I> such belief or conviction is discussed below) was, on the 
  unopposed evidence of this case to take a wrong turning. No decision of the 
  Commission or ECtHR cited to this court has proceeded or been based on such an 
  analysis. The attempt to perform it demonstrates, to my mind, the difficulties 
  and dangers of such an approach. I do not mean to say that such an approach 
  could never be taken, for I repeat that a mere claim to a relevant belief does 
  not make it so: but the difficulties of such an approach have not been 
  surmounted here. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=157><A name=para157>In sum, I find nothing in the Strasbourg 
  jurisprudence reviewed above to cause me to reject, and much to support, a 
  conclusion that the appellants' belief is a religious conviction for the 
  purposes of article 2 of the First Protocol. It follows that for similar 
  reasons I am persuaded that the appellants' belief qualifies as a belief for 
  the purposes of article 9. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Article 9 and the manifestation of belief</I></P>
  <LI value=158><A name=para158>Article 9 protects the right "either alone or in 
  community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or 
  belief, in worship, teaching, practice or observance". The question then 
  arises whether the appellants' freedom in this respect is being interfered 
  with. I put aside for later consideration the "non-interference" point itself, 
  and assume at this stage of the argument that the appellants, in the case of 
  the parents, would be prevented from giving effect to their Christian belief 
  in the need to place their children in an educational environment where 
  corporal punishment is practised. In the case of the teachers, the assumption 
  is that they would be prevented from giving effect to their Christian belief 
  in the need to provide to Christian families an educational system where 
  corporal punishment was available in appropriate cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=159><A name=para159>The question then is whether the carrying out, 
  where appropriate, of that which is prevented would have been a manifestation 
  of those beliefs. That is the paradigm case of alleged interference. It does 
  not seem to me to matter that for much or most of the time, in the absence of 
  an appropriate case for punishment, the appellants' world continues in the 
  same way as it would have done even had section 548 not been amended to 
  include the challenged prohibition. In any event, the appellants' world does 
  not continue in the same way, for it is impossible to promulgate and seek to 
  uphold a scheme of discipline which cannot lawfully be put into practice. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=160><A name=para160>Two separate but intertwined issues arise at 
  this stage. The first relates to the submission expressly made by Mr Keith on 
  behalf of the Secretary of State and upheld by the judge, namely that the 
  exercise and application of the schools' schemes for corporal punishment 
  cannot be regarded as a proper manifestation of the appellants' belief, that 
  it falls on the wrong side of the mere motivation/manifestation dichotomy of 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I>. The second relates to the concern most clearly expressed by 
  Buxton LJ that in any event article 9(1)'s limitation to "worship, teaching, 
  practice and observance" is a deliberately narrow one that shuts out the 
  appellants on the facts of this case. Although the two issues bear on one 
  another, it is necessary to some extent to give separate consideration to 
  each. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=161><A name=para161>I will take the second issue first, because 
  "manifest" is the general expression and it is clearly limited by the 
  expression "in worship, teaching, practice and observance". Buxton LJ is of 
  the view that this limitation is intended to confine the freedom narrowly (see 
  paras 29/31 and 34/35 above). Thus he stresses the Commission's dictum in <I>X 
  v. United Kingdom</I> which mentions "acts of worship and devotion" and argues 
  that the protection is rooted in the concept of religious teaching and 
  worship. To my mind, the reference in <I>X v. United Kingdom </I>to worship 
  and devotion is merely intended as examples by way of a gloss on the 
  Convention's language. "Devotion", a synonym of worship, is in any event not 
  to be found in article 9(1). When the ECtHR refers in <I>Kalaç</I> and 
  <I>Jewish Liturgical Association</I> to this part of article 9(1), it more 
  correctly cites the full language of "worship, teaching, practice and 
  observance", words which go well beyond mere acts of worship or devotion. In 
  any event none of these cases turned on any issue relating to the width of 
  those expressions. Moreover, since article 9(1) is concerned not merely with 
  religion, but with "religion or belief", it is difficult to see why that 
  quartet of words should be exclusively related to religion. Thus while I would 
  accept that the manifestation alleged must of course fall within the 
  Convention's language – and I will also assume that the connection must, 
  applying the words in <I>X v. United Kingdom</I>, be "intimately linked to 
  these attitudes" ie to "the sphere of personal beliefs and religious 
  creeds…the <I>forum internum</I>" (stressing the word "intimately") – I cannot 
  see why the appellants' beliefs in this case do not fall entirely within the 
  letter and the spirit of the words in question. I do not accept that the 
  Convention's language is intended to be narrow, only that the rationale of the 
  freedom to manifest must of course be related to its subject matter, namely to 
  "the sphere of personal beliefs and religious creeds" in the manner indicated 
  by the four expressions used. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=162><A name=para162>In this connection, I would refer to "teaching" 
  as the single most apposite of the four expressions, and, indeed, as directly 
  in point. Its place within article 9(1) demonstrates a close synergy with 
  article 2 of the First Protocol. (That is not to say, however, that practice 
  and observance may not be invoked as well.) The appellants are concerned with 
  the education of the children in Christian values and as a necessary part of 
  that teaching, so they believe, with a system of discipline (and I have in 
  mind the derivation of that word) which includes corporal punishment. The 
  possibility and circumscription of such punishment as well as its imposition, 
  if appropriate, are plainly intended, on the evidence before the court, to be 
  part of a teaching process. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=163><A name=para163>I therefore turn to the second issue. The 
  judge's solution of this issue hinges on his application of the distinction 
  drawn in <I>Arrowsmith </I>between manifestation of a belief and being merely 
  motivated by it. I would emphasise that "merely", because the fact that your 
  action is motivated by your belief does not mean at all that you are not 
  manifesting it. On the contrary, the probability is that you are. That is what 
  makes the facts of <I>Arrowsmith</I> important. The facts as found were that 
  her leaflets "did not express pacifist views…therefore…the applicant, by 
  distributing the leaflets, did not manifest her belief" (para 75). In the 
  present case, however, the appellants' evidence is that the existence and 
  exercise of corporal punishment is itself a demonstration of their belief. 
  Thus the very terms in which it is described in the Admission Statement (see 
  para 104 above) <I>expresses </I>the religious foundation of the policy of 
  corporal punishment. Buxton LJ at para 10 above explains further the 
  circumstances under which such punishment is administered, as does Arden LJ at 
  paras 220/225 and 227. This all takes place within the environment of a 
  Christian school dedicated to Christian education and for the purposes of 
  emphasising, in the rare if appropriate case where corporal punishment is 
  deemed necessary, what parents and school regard as a demonstration of loving 
  Christian correction. In such circumstances I find it hard to accept that the 
  stated policy and above all its application are not manifestations of the 
  appellants' belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=164><A name=para164>On the hypothesis, therefore, that the 
  appellants are at least motivated by a religious belief, there is in my 
  judgment little force in the argument that they are not manifesting it in the 
  present case. How <I>can</I> they exercise their freedom to manifest that 
  belief (other than merely theoretically, in word rather than in deed) save by 
  having a school system of corporal punishment? The deed does not have to 
  express the belief in the form of proclaiming it. A Muslim or Jew who adheres 
  to his religion's dietary laws does not proclaim it (unless perchance there is 
  any need for request or explanation); he does it. To all outward appearances 
  he is like any other person eating a meal: but he is manifesting his religious 
  belief and duty. The same may also be said of a negative act, such as a fast. 
  Although, as Buxton LJ has remarked, the word "manifest" is a somewhat strange 
  word, it clearly does not involve making something clear to others, or no one 
  could manifest his belief "in…private". It is, rather, making the distinction 
  between the <I>forum internum</I> and the external world in which a person 
  acts out his belief. As Arden LJ has pointed out, the fact that a 
  manifestation of belief cannot be regarded as such without the requisite 
  motivation does not mean that an act with the requisite motivation cannot 
  constitute the manifestation of belief. Or, as I have already remarked, the 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I> distinction is between manifestation and mere motivation. In 
  other words, motivation lies on both sides of the dichotomy: but manifestation 
  lies on one side only. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=165><A name=para165>No doubt it is possible, if it was proper to 
  have serious doubts about the wisdom of article 9, to rein in its effect by a 
  generous use of the manifestation/motivation dichotomy. Buxton LJ proceeds in 
  part on the basis that in <I>Arrowsmith</I> and again in <I>X v UK </I>the 
  Commission adopted an apparently "limited approach to article 9(1)" (see at 
  para 30 above). I prefer to view the Commission's decision in <I>Arrowsmith 
  </I>as being based on the facts of that case. As for <I>X v UK</I>, it is hard 
  to see how (at any rate in a democratic society) payment of taxes, which is in 
  any event an obligation recognised by article 1 of the First Protocol and 
  found by the Commission to be a general and neutral act or requirement, 
  involves any act of manifestation for or against any position. Even so, it is 
  not possible to generalise without fear of contradiction – as the case of 
  <I>Darby v Sweden </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1990/24.html">(1991) 13 EHRR 774</a> (see at para 191 below) demonstrates: 
  for there a small part of Swedish tax was ring-fenced for payment to finance 
  the Church of Sweden's religious activities, and the Commission held that 
  article 9(1) <I>was</I> engaged. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=166><A name=para166>In any event it is clear from <I>Kokkinakis</I> 
  (at paras 31 and 33) that the ECtHR does not share such a limited view of the 
  scope and importance of article 9. It is true that the powerful language of 
  the Court in <I>Kokkinakis</I> was deployed in a case concerned with 
  proselytism and that in such a case there is likely to be no issue, and in 
  fact there was none, that there was there a manifestation of belief. But that 
  gives all the more force to the ECtHR's resonant declaration of the general 
  principles involved in article 9, which I will not repeat but which in almost 
  every phrase emphasises the fundamental nature and precious value of the 
  pluralism protected by the article. It cannot be avoided or ignored that it is 
  the very importance of these principles, and of the need for their protection, 
  that at one and the same time sets up the conundrum of how to limit abuse of 
  such rights by those invoking them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=167><A name=para167>In this connection Buxton LJ suggests that 
  <I>Kokkinakis </I>is to be explained or interpreted in the light of the fact 
  that it was concerned with proselytism, and that the act of proselytism is an 
  archetypal form ("the very essence") of manifestation of belief (see para 36 
  above). I do not for one moment say that proselytism does not fall within the 
  scope of article 9(1) – albeit it does not do so expressly – but I would 
  hesitate to think that it lies at its heart. There is of course a great 
  difference between proselytism and the teaching of children. It may be that in 
  some religions (but not all) proselytism is a religious duty. However, it 
  differs from most religious duties in that it is not directed at telling the 
  believer or adherent how to live <I>his </I>or <I>her</I> life but at 
  persuading <I>others</I>, the non-believers or non-adherents, how to live 
  <I>their </I>lives. As such it is a peculiarly dangerous form of 
  manifestation. Certain forms of proselytism perhaps more than any other 
  manifestation of religious or non-religious belief have at times of our human 
  history brought, by what would now be widely but (sadly) not universally 
  regarded as its abuse, terrible misery on mankind. There is no necessary 
  virtue or guarantee against vice in even the plainest kinds of manifestation. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=168><A name=para168>Hence the importance of article 9(2). Buxton LJ 
  argues (at para 39 above) that its significance can be overstated, in that to 
  place the State under the burden of justification is to impose a material 
  limitation on the freedom of action of its democratic institutions. The 
  freedom of action remains: but it may need justification. In an event it would 
  upset the balance of article 9, especially if I am correct to assume that a 
  religious belief must be worthy of respect in a democratic society and not be 
  incompatible with human dignity, to over-employ the motivation/manifestation 
  dichotomy so as to undermine the freedoms guaranteed by article 9(1). It is 
  accepted in this case by the Secretary of State that he has no submission to 
  make under article 9(2), were article 9(1) to be engaged. It would seem to me 
  to be contrary to principle in an article which is expressly balanced by its 
  second paragraph to seek by a harsh application of a formal test, which in 
  many cases would be difficult to apply on any rational basis, to prevent even 
  the engagement of the article in the first place. This would have the tendency 
  to replace the balanced approach required in article 9(2) by a formal test as 
  to what amounted to a sufficient manifestation of a belief ex hypothesi 
  motivated by thought, conscience or religion, the right to freedom of which is 
  guaranteed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Article 2 of the First Protocol and "respect" of the parents' 
  right</I></P>
  <LI value=169><A name=para169>I return to article 2 of the First Protocol to 
  consider whether there is any failure to "respect" the right of parents to 
  ensure education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and 
  philosophical convictions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=170><A name=para170>I do not regard this as a "curriculum" case. If 
  it was a question of what the State could permissibly include in its 
  curriculum, then the test is one of expediency whose solution may depend on 
  country and era and the ECtHR allows a wide discretion provided that the State 
  stops short of indoctrination (<I>Kjeldsen and others </I>at para 53<I>, 
  Valsamis</I> at para 28). The question here however is not one of State 
  indoctrination but whether the State can prevent parents who send their 
  children to a private school, independent of the State, to enable them and the 
  teachers there to give a special place in the education of their young to 
  their Christian faith, from giving room to their religious convictions as to 
  the role of discipline as an integral part of that education. For these 
  purposes the test is not whether the State's curriculum amounts to 
  indoctrination, but whether the State's (assumed) interference fails to 
  demonstrate "respect" for the appellants' religious conviction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=171><A name=para171>It follows that the State must "respect" the 
  religious conviction in question. It is clear on Strasbourg jurisprudence, and 
  I believe that it is common ground, that "respect" – </A>

    addition to a primarily negative undertaking, it implies some positive 
    obligation on the part of the State. This being so, the duty to respect 
    parental convictions in this sphere cannot be overridden by the alleged 
    necessity of striking a balance between the conflicting views involved…" 
    (<I>Campbell and Cosans</I> at para 37, and see <I>Valsamis</I> at para 
  27).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=172><A name=para172>In the present case, because the parents and

  is no need in any event for the State to seek to impose a balance between 
  peoples of conflicting views. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=173><A name=para173>Of course, there are conflicting views about the 
  merits of the appellants' position, and I assume, without knowing, that there 
  would also be conflicting views among Christians about their interpretation of 
  their Christian responsibilities in this respect. I am aware, for instance, 
  that despite the texts within Proverbs, the Jewish tradition, presumably part 
  of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, has been much influenced by a verse in 
  Leviticus 19:14 ("you shall not place a stumbling-block before the blind") 
  which has been interpreted by Maimonides among others to relate to the need 
  for a parent to be cautious in the discipline of children ("lest he cause them 
  to stumble") and has led another famous medieval rabbinic commentator to 
  counsel "Rather, he [the child] ought to be spoken to and won over." </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=174><A name=para174>Nevertheless, the Convention protects the rights 
  of people to differ as to such matters, within the limits of the terms and 
  principles of its articles. The importance of the safeguards provided by 
  article 9 and article 2 of the First Protocol are emphasised by the European 
  Court in <I>Kokkinakis</I> (at paras 31 and 33) and in <I>Kjeldsen and Others 
  </I>(at para 50) and <I>Campbell and Cosans</I> (at para 32). It is right to 
  be concerned at the possible dangers of extreme fundamentalist views, but just 
  as article 9 contains its own limitations inter alia in article 9(2) so I have 
  assumed that article 2 of the First Protocol is itself subject to the test of 
  what is worthy of respect in a democratic society and is not incompatible with 
  human dignity. I also assume for these purposes that "respect" permits the 
  State, in pursuance of democratic values, to interfere in a proportionate way. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=175><A name=para175>Nevertheless, just as it is accepted in this 
  case by the Secretary of State that he has no submission to make under article 
  9(2), were article 9(1) to be engaged, so no argument been raised to the 
  effect that the State's interference with any parental right engaged under 
  article 2 is no more than a proportionate and legitimate interference which 
  "respects" that right. That again is to enter on the "balancing" or 
  justification argument which is not before this court. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=176><A name=para176>I conclude therefore that the appellants' belief

  and from the judgment in <I>Pretty v. United Kingdom (application 2346/02) 
  </I>have been set out by Buxton LJ at paras 42/43 and 46 above. On behalf of 
  the Secretary of State, Mr Keith was reluctant to submit that these took the 
  argument very much forward, and I am inclined to agree with him. They indicate 
  that the test in <I>Arrowsmith </I>is an established test, but, despite Mr 
  Diamond's submission to the contrary, I am not in doubt of that. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=178><A name=para178>Ultimately their Lordships recognised that Mrs 
  Pretty's claim would fail under article 9(2) in any event. However Mrs Pretty 
  was claiming not so much the right to the exercise of a religious belief, but 
  the right for her husband to act, free of the criminal code, in accordance 
  with her personal conscience. Nor did she say that her beliefs mandated her 
  husband's acts but rather that they ought to be regarded as permitting them. 
  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill said (at para 31) "her belief cannot found a 
  requirement that her husband should be absolved from the consequences of 
  conduct which, although it would be consistent with her belief, is proscribed 
  by the criminal law". Lord Steyn merely said (at para 63) that article 9 was 
  never intended "to give individuals a right to perform acts in pursuance of 
  whatever beliefs they hold". And Lord Hope of Craighead pointed out (at para 
  101) that article 9 could not be strained as far as to give someone "a right 
  to do whatever her beliefs allow her to do". </A>

  <P><I>"Victim"</I></P>
  <LI value=180><A name=para180>In his skeleton argument Mr Keith submitted that

  oral hearing, however, he conceded that the parents among the appellants were 
  victims, and that seems to me to be a necessary concession. In the 
  circumstances it is not necessary to decide whether the teachers and head 
  teachers are also "victims" but I would be inclined to say that they were. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Section 13 of the HRA 1998</I></P>
  <LI value=181><A name=para181>Thus far there is no need for me to decide any 
  point of substance about the effect of section 13, and I do not. Like Buxton 
  LJ, I am uncertain whether the expression "religious organisation" could apply 
  to schools or the expression "members" could apply to parents. But I am 
  equally uncertain that he is right to conclude that if, without the assistance 
  of section 13, a court would say that there is no engagement of article 9(1), 
  it necessarily follows that section 13 can add nothing to the argument. That 
  would be to ascribe to Parliament, if not, for the reason given by Buxton LJ 
  at para 49, a complete <I>brutum fulmen</I>, at any rate an intention which 
  seems oddly worded for the result there proposed by him. Similarly, I am in 
  doubt (see Arden LJ's provisional view at para 313) that section 3 of the HRA 
  1998 might ensure that section 13 could in any event make no difference. 
  Compatibility with the Convention does not necessarily prevent English law 
  from enhancing or further entrenching a Convention right, unless in a 
  particular case the effect of doing so would be to undermine another 
  Convention right. It is difficult to foresee the scope of this argument in the 
  abstract. In the circumstances I would merely comment that as far as it goes 
  the section would seem to support my view that the Convention rights inherent 
  in freedom of thought, conscience and religion are not readily to be treated 
  as limited ones, for the court is to have "particular regard to the importance 
  of that right". </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The non-interference point</I></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=182><A name=para182>For the reasons discussed above I would be 
  satisfied that, on the limited basis on which this appeal was originally 
  argued on behalf of the Secretary of State, the appellants had demonstrated 
  manifestation of a religious belief for the purposes of article 9 as well as 
  the State's lack of respect for a relevant conviction for the purposes of 
  article 2 of the First Protocol, and that therefore each of those articles of 
  the Convention was engaged. In the absence of any case under article 9(2) or 
  any analogous case under article 2, the appellants would have been entitled to 
  the protection of the Convention. In such an event, it was conceded on behalf 
  of the Secretary of State that section 548 could be "read down" pursuant to 
  section 3(1) of the HRA 1998 so as to avoid any need for a declaration of 
  incompatibility. No submissions as to the precise terms of such a reading down 
  have been made. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=183><A name=para183>As stated above, however, after it had reserved 
  judgment the court itself raised a further point, which led to further 
  submissions and a new hearing. The point, which I have described above as the 
  "non-interference" point, raises the question, albeit a relevant belief 
  exists, and the complainant can show that such a belief is capable of 
  manifestation for the purposes of article 9, whether there has in fact been 
  any interference with it or its manifestation. For the purposes of article 2 
  of the First Protocol the question would, by analogy, be whether any lack of 
  respect for the parents' right is shown in circumstances where there has been 
  no interference with it. The factual background to this new point was evidence 
  before the court that at least some schools allowed or even preferred the 
  corporal punishment of their pupils, when necessary, to be carried out by 
  parents. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=184><A name=para184>The new point brought into clearer focus 
  evidence that had already been put before the court concerning procedures 
  which are followed when corporal punishment is deemed necessary. Thus the 
  principal of the Maranatha Christian School in Wiltshire wrote that the ideal 
  option is for a parent to attend the school during school hours to administer 
  the punishment. The second option is for the matter to be discussed with the 
  parent over the telephone and for the punishment to be administered at home 
  the same evening. Only in the absence of those options is punishment 
  administered by the school itself. The head teacher of another school, the 
  Emmanuel Christian School in Rochdale, said that parents are invited to come 
  in and administer the corporal punishment themselves, but it is not clear 
  whether this is the sole, preferred or merely alternative procedure. The head 
  teacher of a third school, the King's School Senior in Eastleigh, Hampshire, 
  stated that corporal punishment is administered by himself after consultation 
  with the parent, but goes on to discuss possible reactions to a change of law 
  which would prohibit such punishment in schools. He writes: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Parents would be contacted by phone, personally or by letter 
    and asked to carry out corporal discipline in school. In the event of their 
    being unable to do this, a letter would be sent home, after contacting the 
    parents and the parents would carry out the discipline at home."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=185><A name=para185>He added: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Clearly these changes would mean that there would be some delay 
    before discipline could be administered, which would be less than ideal, but 
    it would help to ensure that Christian principles could continue to be 
    upheld in the school's discipline policy." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=186><A name=para186>In the light of the emergence of the new point 
  Mr Williamson and Mr Sammons, respectively head teacher and a member of staff 
  (and parent of a child) at Christian Fellowship School, Liverpool, jointly 
  made a new witness statement in which they expressed opposition to the concept 
  of parental implementation of corporal discipline at the request of the 
  school. They said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is the view of the parents of the children, and the teachers 
    of the children, that delayed disciplining of children is both unpractical 
    and unworkable."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=187><A name=para187>They then developed that submission by reference 
  to practical considerations from the perspective of the child, the school 
  community, the parents, and the school. Thus, disruption would be caused to 
  all concerned. Disciplinary policy would suffer. Discipline administered by 
  the parent at home at the end of the school day would be out of context and 
  would mar the loving reunion of parent and child. The discipline would not be 
  publicly administered, but become a purely private event. Consistency of 
  discipline would suffer. Justice would be delayed, whereas what was sought was 
  discipline at the time of the misdemeanour. Although the submission was 
  primarily put as a matter of what is "both unpractical and unworkable", they 
  also stated that both parents and teachers </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"would regard such a scenario as an infringement of their 
    rights; the parents because they specifically desire the teachers to 
    discipline their children (at the time of the misdemeanour) and for the 
    teachers who seek to serve the Lord in the provision of a Christian 
    education." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=188><A name=para188>No specific religious belief was, however,

  held that there was no interference in the rights guaranteed by articles 8 or 
  9 because Sweden's code of parenthood contained no sanction nor was there any

  ECtHR found in favour of a complaint under article 1 of the First Protocol 
  (taken together with article 14) brought by a Finnish citizen who was required 
  to pay Swedish tax used in part to finance the Church of Sweden's religious 
  activities. Non-members of the Church who were registered in Sweden could 
  avoid paying that part of Swedish tax devoted to the Church, but the 
  complainant could not avail himself of that exemption because, although he 
  worked and was taxed in Sweden, he did not have the status of being 
  permanently registered there since he returned home to Finland at the 
  weekends. In the circumstances the ECtHR did not have to consider the claim 
  under article 9. However the Commission had upheld it, rejecting Sweden's 
  submission that he could have avoided the tax by becoming resident in Sweden. 
  The Commission held that article 9 protected everyone from being compelled to 
  be involved directly in religious affairs against his will, and continued (at

  complaint under article 9 was manifestly ill-founded. The complainant had 
  commenced employment with the state railways in 1986 and in 1989 had joined 
  the Seventh-day Adventist Church and had thus become obliged to observe the 
  sabbath on Saturdays, commencing at sunset on Friday. He had never been 
  required to work on the weekend, but he started leaving his work early on 
  Friday nights, giving his employers warning and offering to make up his missed 
  hours by working longer in the summer, when sunset on Fridays fell later. He 
  was dismissed. The Commission found - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"that the applicant was not dismissed because of his religious 
    convictions but for having refused to respect his working hours. This 
    refusal, even if motivated by his religious convictions, cannot as such be 
    considered protected by Article 9(1). Nor has the applicant shown that he 
    was pressured to change his religious views or prevented from manifesting 
    his religion or belief. </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"28. In choosing to pursue a military career Kalaç was accepting 
    of his own accord a system of military discipline that by its very nature 
    implied the possibility of placing on certain of the rights and freedoms of 
    members of the armed forces limitations incapable of being imposed on 
    civilians. States may adopt for their armies disciplinary regulations 
    forbidding this or that type of conduct, in particular an attitude inimical 
    to an established order reflecting the requirements of military 
  service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"29. It is not contested that the applicant, within the limits 
    imposed by the requirements of military life, was able to fulfil the 
    obligations which constitute the normal forms through which a Muslim 
    practices his religion. For example, he was in particular permitted to pray 
    five times a day and to perform his other religious duties, such as keeping 
    the fast of Ramadan and attending Friday prayers at the mosque.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"30. The Supreme Military Council's order was, moreover, not 
    based on Group Captain Kalaç's religious opinions or beliefs or the way he 
    had performed his religious duties but on his conduct and attitude.

    discipline and infringed the principle of secularism."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=198><A name=para198>Unless the essence of the reasoning is properly

  under article 9(2), rather than to reject it under article 9(1): see the 
  criticism in <I>Clayton &amp; Tomlinson</I>, The Law of Human Rights, 2000, at 
  973. In any event, this court is not concerned with military service, nor 
  indeed with any voluntary act by which the appellants have bound themselves to 
  accept some limitation on what might otherwise have been the full exercise of 
  their rights. Nevertheless, this decision does demonstrate, albeit on its own 
  special facts, that in considering whether there has been an interference with 
  rights protected under article 9, the ECtHR will consider whether, subject to 
  any voluntarily accepted limitation, the complainant remains essentially free 
  to exercise his rights of religion. </A>

  whereby ritual slaughter was permitted on terms not otherwise lawful under 
  domestic law, in that there was an exemption from the requirement of 
  pre-stunning of animals. The regime required the licensing of representative 
  bodies. One such body, ACIP, an umbrella organisation regarded as 
  representative of the majority of French Jews, was so licensed. However, a 
  substantial number of French Jews, some 40,000, of a more orthodox persuasion, 
  required more stringent conditions of ritual slaughter to be performed than 
  were practised in the ACIP abattoirs, necessitating examination of the 
  carcasses for any impurity or previous disease. It was not in dispute that 
  these requirements for the certification of "glatt" kosher meat were a matter 
  of religious belief, practice and observance. The complainant association, 
  which sought to provide a glatt kashrut service for its adherents, was 
  nevertheless refused a licence, apparently on the grounds that the association 
  was not a religious body and/or that its adherents were insufficiently 
  numerous. However, before the ECtHR the French government's primary argument 
  was that there had been no interference with the association's adherents' 
  rights under article 9(1): because glatt meat was available from Belgium; 
  because a small number of ACIP butchers were willing to conduct the further 
  examinations necessary for the assurance of glatt meat; and because ACIP was 
  willing to reach an agreement with the association whereby it would institute 
  for a fee the required examination (albeit the association doubted ACIP's 
  ability to do so). </A>

  <LI value=200><A name=para200>The ECtHR accepted these latter submissions and

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the court's opinion, there would be interference with the

  <LI value=201><A name=para201>In my judgment the test of impossibility is

  freedoms. That was not the test propounded by the Commission in <I>Darby v. 
  Sweden</I>. I would have thought that once some material interference is 
  proved under article 9(1), it becomes a matter for the balancing act to be 
  conducted under article 9(2). There was a powerful dissent by members of the 
  Court, on that and other aspects of the decision. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=202><A name=para202>This then is a rather ambivalent collection of 
  authorities, but even so there is a consistent thread running through them to 
  the effect that it is not enough to show that a right protected under article 
  9(1) is theoretically in play unless it can also be shown that that right has 
  been interfered with in some material way. In judging what is material the 
  ECtHR will apparently have regard to any limitations which the complainant has 
  voluntarily accepted. And it will not be bound to take the complainant's 
  protestations of interference at face value if on an objective assessment they 
  do not amount to anything material. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=203><A name=para203>It is therefore necessary to have regard to the 
  non-interference point for the purposes of the present case. I seek to do so 
  conscientiously, bearing in mind that it was not a point originally taken on 
  behalf of the Secretary of State, but also that logically there can be no 
  valid complaint without a finding of interference. Above all, I remain anxious 
  that the non-interference point should not become the source for a "with one 
  bound our hero was free" form of jurisprudence. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=204><A name=para204>With these thoughts I approach the evidence 
  before this court. In my judgment there is nothing in that evidence, other 
  than the new witness statement of Messrs Williamson and Sammons, to throw any 
  doubt on the proposition that a system of corporal punishment at school could 
  be successfully maintained even though the implementation of any such 
  punishment would be at the hands of parents rather than teachers, whether that 
  is done at school or even at home. The involvement of parents is indeed the 
  preferred option of at least one school; an existing option of at least one 
  other school; and in the case of a third school is regarded as an option which 
  could be introduced in the light of section 548 and which, although "less than 
  ideal" would "help to ensure that the desired Christian principles would 
  continue to be upheld in the school's discipline policy". When, therefore, I 
  bear in mind that in the appellants' scheme of things corporal punishment is 
  but one part of a holistic Christian approach to punishment, at home as well 
  as at school, and, on the evidence and as is likely a relatively rare form of 
  punishment, and in any event one to be applied "only after careful 
  consideration of all the circumstances of the case" (see the citation by Arden 
  LJ from the evidence at para 227 of her judgment), I cannot believe that the 
  need for it to be applied by parents rather than by teachers can affect the 
  practicalities of that system, and certainly not in a way that impinges on the 
  appellants' belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=205><A name=para205>Is there then anything in the new witness 
  statement to cause me to have doubts about that judgment, or, as Arden LJ has 
  done, to distinguish the Liverpool school tradition as speaking to a further 
  refinement of Christian belief? Seeing the difference of opinion on this 
  question between Buxton LJ and Arden LJ, I have given this matter particularly 
  anxious scrutiny. In the end I have maintained my first insight and have 
  concluded that no distinction is to be made. In his first witness statement Mr 
  Williamson, the head teacher of the Liverpool school, was happy to annex the 
  letters or other material from the head teachers of other schools in which 
  they spoke, as set out above, of a more relaxed attitude to the practicalities 
  of parental implementation of school corporal discipline. It is only in his 
  second witness statement that, together with Mr Sammons, he rejects the 
  practicalities of such a system. It seems to me that, despite their comment 
  that parents, children and teachers would regard such a scenario as an 
  infringement of their rights, the real objection goes to practicalities or 
  modalities, not to any difference in belief. I do not regard the citation of 
  King Solomon's dictum as taking the matter further. No one doubts that delay 
  is an enemy of justice. But what amounts to delay depends on the 
  circumstances. Justice does not depend on its instant execution, even in a 
  school. King Solomon was talking about the paradox of God's justice, for the 
  very reason that it may well be delayed: for God is long-suffering. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=206><A name=para206>In my judgment therefore section 548 does not 
  interfere materially with the appellants' manifestation of religious beliefs. 
  I accept the existence of those beliefs, and that a complete ban on corporal 
  punishment would interfere with the manifestation of them and would have to be 
  justified under article 9(2), a question with which this court has not been 
  concerned but which might possibly arise in another case. But I do not on the 
  evidence before the court think that section 548 has materially interfered 
  with a Christian scheme of corporal punishment in school in circumstances 
  where the actual application of the punishment can be performed by the parents 
  themselves. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=207><A name=para207>In arriving at this conclusion I have borne 
  section 13 of the HRA 1998 in mind (see para 173 above). It is possible, but I 
  do not decide, that even the question of non-interference is indeed a 
  "question arising under this Act" which might affect the exercise by the 
  appellants of their rights under article 9(1). On the assumption that section 
  13 might apply, I have sought, as I trust this judgment will have 
  demonstrated, to ensure that I have had particular regard to the importance of 
  those rights. Even so, I have concluded that section 548 does not materially 
  interfere with those rights. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=208><A name=para208>It follows that, for the same reasons, there can

  <LI value=209><A name=para209>In the circumstances I cannot see how there

  10, if I were wrong about non-interference, it would still be unnecessary to 
  deal separately with article 10. Since the essence of the appellants' beliefs 
  is that the existence and use of a scheme for corporal punishment in school 
  (whether or not the actual application of the punishment is at home) is part 
  of a teaching process, I would prefer to say nothing further about it. </A>

  <LI value=212><A name=para212>In my judgment, the appeal must be dismissed for 
  the reasons given below. In summary: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>a) On the evidence, it is an integral and necessary part of the 
    religious beliefs of the appellants that, where appropriate, they should 
    discipline children in their care by what the judge called "smacking". In 
    the view of some of the appellants such chastisement for conduct at school 
    can be carried out at school or at home by the child's parents. However, the 
    religious belief of some of the appellants, whom I will call "the Liverpool 
    school", is that such chastisement must be carried out without delay, and 
    that this will from time to time involve its being carried out at school by 
    teachers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>b) On the basis of the evidence and arguments in this case, when 
    they impose such chastisement, the appellant parents "manifest" their 
    religious beliefs for the purposes of article 9 of the European Convention 
    on Human Rights ("the Convention").</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>c) However, the beliefs of the appellant parents do not require 
    that they should send their children to a school, alternatively (save in the 
    case of the Liverpool school) that chastisement should be carried out by 
    teachers. Therefore, section 548 of the Education Act 1996 (as amended), by 
    prohibiting the imposition <I>by teachers</I> of corporal punishment, does 
    not interfere with the appellant parents' freedom to manifest their 
    religion. There is no violation of the appellant teachers' rights under 
    article 9 of the Convention because they cannot have any better rights than 
    the appellant parents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>d) There is no violation of articles 8 or 10 of the Convention, 
    or of article 2 of the First Protocol to the Convention.</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P></P>
  <P><I>Introduction</I></P>
  <LI value=214><A name=order214>Article 9(1) of the Convention contains an 
  absolute right to freedom of religion and a qualified right to manifest one's 
  religion by (among other ways) practice. Article 9(1) is in these terms: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
    religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and 
    freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, 
    to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and 
    observance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=215><A name=order215>Freedom to manifest one's religion is qualified 
  by article 9(2): </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be 
    subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary 
    in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the 
    protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the 
    rights and freedoms of others."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=216><A name=order216>Article 9 and later provisions of the 
  Convention (such as article 14, prohibition of discrimination in the enjoyment 
  of Convention rights) show that the Convention protects and promotes, in terms 
  of beliefs, a pluralist society. The same point has been made by the European 
  Court of Human Rights ("the Strasbourg court") in the <I>Kokkinakis</I> case 
  to which I refer below. By a pluralist society, I mean one that treats people 
  of different opinions and religious beliefs on the same footing, <I>without 
  any one group having</I> <I>dominance over any other group</I>. It is one of 
  the functions of the court to stand as a bulwark between the state and the 
  interests of minorities which the Convention regards as deserving of 
  recognition in a modern, democratic and plural society. The appellants' claim 
  is one for religious tolerance. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=217><A name=order217>I should like at this point to express my 
  appreciation of the judge's judgment, and also to acknowledge the benefit 
  which I have derived from having read the judgments of Buxton and Rix LJJ in 
  draft. There are several points in those judgments with which I am in 
  disagreement, but on many of these issues there is room for philosophical 
  debate and different policy approaches. It would be an impossible task to 
  answer all the points that they or the parties make, and I have not sought to 
  do so. Anyone reading all four judgments might well be reminded of what I 
  understand to be a Hindu principle: "Truth is one – men call it many things". 
  However, in my view the differences are potentially significant: they reflect 
  different views as to the role of freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
  under the Convention. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=218><A name=order218>There is no suggestion in this case that the 
  State has violated the absolute right to freedom of religion: the State has 
  not prevented the appellants from holding any particular beliefs. This case 
  turns on whether there has been any violation of the qualified right conferred 
  by article 9(1) of freedom to manifest religious beliefs by worship, teaching, 
  practice and observance. This case is unusual in many respects, not least 
  because it requires the court to ascertain and comprehend the religious 
  beliefs of the appellants. That exercise does not have to be performed by a 
  court very often, and, as the appellants deny that it is open to a court to 
  reject their beliefs, I will have more to say about this topic about this 
  later in this judgment (see below "<I>What is religious belief? The court's 
  function</I>"). The case is also unusual because both the parents and teachers 
  are at one in their beliefs as to the value of the form of discipline for 
  children for which they contend. Moreover, the Secretary of State does not 
  contend that these views are contrary to the public interest. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=219><A name=order219>The beliefs in question here are Christian 
  beliefs but the court's function would, of course, be exactly the same whether 
  the beliefs were, for example, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist or Sikh. I 
  would add this. I have not found the beliefs relied on necessarily 
  straightforward and it might usefully be borne in mind for any future case of 
  this kind that the court is likely to need help in understanding these matters 
  unless very clearly explained. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>The appellants' beliefs</I></P>
  <LI value=220><A name=order220>It is important to understand what the parents 
  in this case contend to be their religious beliefs. The judge was able to 
  summarise their beliefs in some two or three sentences. For my part, I have 
  found it necessary to consider their beliefs in rather more detail in order to 
  see how the Convention applies to them. What follows is a short and no doubt 
  inadequate reflection of some of the views expressed in the evidence of the 
  teachers and parents in this case contained in the appeal bundle (particularly 
  pages 11 – 14, 23, 24, 25, 37, 57, 58, 63, 66, 71 74, 76 – 79, 85, 88, 90, 94, 
  96 of the main appeal bundle, and pages 40 – 43 of the supplementary appeal 
  bundle). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=221><A name=order221>As Christians, the parents believe that 
  children are the gift of God and that it is part of the Christian duty of 
  parents to bring up their children as Christians so that they conduct 
  themselves in accordance with the Bible, which contains the Word of God. They 
  also believe that the Bible teaches that as loving, caring parents they should 
  if necessary chastise their children as a form of correction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=222><A name=order222>They also believe that family and school are a 
  partnership in the upbringing of children and that the school should reinforce 
  the principles of the Christian faith taught at home and that, in fulfilment 
  of the duties which the Bible imposes on them, they should be free to give 
  authority to their children's school to administer corporal punishment as a 
  means of correction where the child has committed behaviour which contravenes 
  Christian precepts and in order to convey in that situation respect for God's 
  commandments. They consider that such correction is applied not <I>to </I>the 
  child but <I>for </I>the child and out of love for the child:- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Discipline is administered because we love the child and 
    disapprove of wrong attitudes and behaviour. This is made very clear to the 
    child before and after any corporal discipline is applied. The child is 
    always affirmed and accepted. It is the behaviour and attitudes that need to 
    be changed." (Letter dated 21 July 1999 from Mr D Greenwood, Headteacher, 
    The King's School Senior, Hampshire.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=223><A name=order223>In an endeavour to convey this approach, I will 
  for my own part refer to the corporal punishment which these parents have in 
  mind as "correction" in order to distinguish it from corporal punishment 
  applied simply as punishment. I accept that many people on principle oppose 
  any form of corporal punishment for children, even a smack, and whether that 
  punishment is imposed by teachers or by parents. In the opinion of many, this 
  form of punishment is wrong because it violates the dignity of the child. As I 
  have already said, the court does not have to decide whether this opinion is 
  right or wrong. However, in my judgment, just as that opinion is 
  understandable and responsible, so too it cannot be said that the appellants' 
  belief in the correction in issue in this case is incapable of being 
  reasonably held. The circumstances in which correction is applied, must of 
  course, be relevant, but children need moral guidance and it is said by some 
  that (unintended) psychological distress and damage can flow from other 
  sanctions imposed on children, such as verbal rebukes and isolation. In this 
  regard, the proper upbringing of children raises moral issues of the greatest 
  importance on which views may reasonably differ in a modern democratic 
  society. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=224><A name=order224>Of course, society may decide that it is 
  contrary to the public interest that even a smack should be unlawful because 
  it might lead to something much worse. However, the Secretary of State places 
  no reliance on this appeal on that argument, which would have been an argument 
  based on article 9(2) of the Convention. Moreover, the appellants have not 
  themselves sought to engage in the debate referred to above. Their case is 
  that correction is part of their religious beliefs and that the Convention 
  requires the State to respect those beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=225><A name=order225>The appellants rely on several Biblical texts, 
  including the following passages from the Book of Proverbs (as appearing in 
  The New English Bible):- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>11. My son, do not spurn the Lord's correction or take offence 
    at his reproof; </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>12. For those whom he loves the Lord reproves, and he punishes a 
    favourite son. (Proverbs, Ch.3) </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>24. A father who spares the rod hates his son, but one who loves 
    him keeps him in order (Proverbs, Ch.13) </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>6. Start a boy on the right road, and even in old age he will 
    not leave it. (Proverbs, Ch.22) </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>15. Rod and reprimand impart wisdom but a boy who runs wild 
    brings shame on his mother... </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>17. Correct your son, and he will be a comfort to you and bring 
    you delights of every kind. (Proverbs, Ch.29)</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=226><A name=order226>It follows that it is positively part of the 
  appellants' belief in this case that the Bible instructs them to apply 
  correction to children in appropriate cases. That is an essential element of 
  this case. Moreover, in respectful disagreement with Buxton LJ, the references 
  to "rod" clearly support the appellants' case that the punishment which these 
  passages enjoin is physical. It does not seem to me to be a point which 
  adversely affects the appellants' case, as Buxton LJ has held (judgment, 
  paragraph 35), that a paddle or strap (rather than a rod) is used (see the 
  next paragraph), or that there are limits on its use (see below) not expressly 
  addressed in these passages, or that the identity of the person who is to 
  administer the correction or the type of offences for which it is to be 
  administered is not specified. If the Convention right to freedom of religion 
  is to be given practical meaning, beliefs cannot be subject to scrutiny of 
  this intensity. There must be many religious beliefs that could not pass the 
  acid test of being fully worked out. Furthermore, I do not agree with the 
  judge that the appellants' belief in correction is not a religious belief but 
  simply a belief that it is a more effective deterrent (a point to which I 
  return below). That conclusion appears to me to be contrary to the evidence as 
  summarised above. Like the judge, however, I anticipate that not all 
  Christians could nowadays contend that they read the Bible as literally as the 
  appellants do. If anyone else were to apply the same correction but for other 
  reasons, or the belief of the appellants does not qualify as a religious 
  belief, then as explained below the appellants would have to satisfy the court 
  that they have a relevant philosophical conviction for the purposes of the 
  Convention. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=227><A name=order227>In considering the nature of the correction 
  sought to be applied by the appellants, it must be placed in the context of 
  the Christian message. The quintessence of Christianity is that God is a God 
  of love, who forgives and desires reconciliation with human beings, and that 
  the basic duties of Christians in all aspects of their lives are to love God 
  and to love one another. The duty of God necessitates, of course, obeying His 
  commandments. The schools to which the parents send their children provide 
  education on Christian principles. Correction (as defined by me above) has, 
  therefore, to be seen in the context of a belief that attaches great 
  importance to love. This can be seen from the evidence filed by the 
  appellants:- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Corporal punishment in the form of the paddle for boys and the 
    strap for girls (administered by female staff to girls) is used only after 
    careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case. Parents are 
    informed of the reasons for its use. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>It is never administered with the aim of humiliation, but to 
    minister justice, forgiveness and reconciliation. In short, to help form 
    godly character. Only designated staff will administer punishment, and a 
    school record will be kept. Most children will never require this form of 
    discipline, its presence in the school is an effective deterrent ...

  <LI value=228><A name=order228>The schools in question are in the independent 
  sector. The schools seek the agreement of parents to their policy on 
  discipline, including correction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=229><A name=order229>It does not in my judgment matter that there is 
  not an exact correspondence between the Biblical texts which have been cited 
  and the correction which the appellants seek to support. The appellants have 
  properly sought to put forward a strictly regulated form of correction to 
  avoid any risk of its being confused with a more severe form of corporal 
  punishment which would be either in contravention of the Convention or 
  contrary to the common law. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=230><A name=order230>It must also be borne in mind that scriptural 
  texts are often subject to a substantial amount of interpretation by scholars 
  and theologians. Moreover some adherents may read scriptural texts more 
  literally than others. In addition scriptural texts have been known to 
  conflict. The relevant question here is not why the appellants hold their 
  beliefs, but what do they believe? Under article 9(1), it is not for the state 
  or the court to approve or disapprove of those beliefs or to substitute its 
  own understanding of Christianity for that of the appellants. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=231><A name=order231>Moreover, it must also be recalled that the 
  Secretary of State has not suggested that the appellants' beliefs are not 
  genuinely held. His case is that correction does not amount to the 
  manifestation of a religious belief within the qualified right conferred by 
  article 9(1). If he had challenged the appellants' beliefs, there would have 
  been more evidence, including perhaps oral evidence and cross-examination. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=232><A name=order232>A subgroup of the appellants, referred to above 
  as "the Liverpool school" and who include Mr P R Williamson, Headteacher of 
  the Christian Fellowship School, Liverpool, and Mr Roy Sammons, the parent of 
  a child at that school, go further in their beliefs. Their belief is that the 
  discipline of a child by correction must occur at the time of the 
  misdemeanour. They rely on the following passage from the Bible (authorised 
  version):- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, 
    therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." 
    (Ecclesiastes, chapter 8, verse 11) </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In the New English Bible this reads:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is because sentence upon a wicked act is not promptly 
    carried out that men do evil so boldly.". (Ecclesiastes chapter 8, verse 
  11).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=233><A name=order233>Their beliefs, therefore, differ from those of 
  other appellants because they believe that correction, when appropriate, 
  should be applied without delay at school and in the school context. They gave 
  a number of pedagogical reasons for their belief. There is no reason why such 
  a subgroup of adherents cannot exist. The Convention does not require that all 
  adherents of the same religion have exactly the same beliefs. In a pluralist 
  society the freedom for adherents to have different beliefs must be respected. 
  I do not share Buxton LJ's difficulties with the fact that the Liverpool 
  school have different views from those of the other appellants. I am prepared 
  to accept that their belief in immediate correction forms a part of their 
  religious beliefs. Their belief is that, to achieve its religious purposes, 
  correction must be carried out in context. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=234><A name=order234>Although not probative of the appellants' 
  belief in this case, I note that, when the Scottish Law Commission published a 
  discussion paper on corporal punishment, the responses it received on

  Bible authorised correction. The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland

  <P><I>Correction is limited</I></P>
  <LI value=235><A name=order235>No party to this appeal has suggested that 
  correction amounts to child abuse. I have referred to the emphasis placed on 
  love for the child. Moreover, correction is only applied to the buttocks or 
  the hand. There is no evidence that it leaves any physical mark on the child. 
  It is not applied as punishment for poor academic performance. It is to be 
  noted that the parents and the teachers are at one on their approach to 
  correction: it is not contended that correction could be administered without 
  the authority of the child's parents or against the wishes of the teachers.

  <P><I>Strasbourg jurisprudence on corporal punishment in schools</I></P>
  <LI value=236><A name=order236>Mr Hugo Keith, for the Secretary of State, 
  relies on the fact that the Strasbourg court, in its conclusion in 
  <I>Costello-Roberts</I> <I>v UK</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/16.html">[1993] 19 EHRR 112</a> that article 8 (respect 
  for private life) was not violated in that case, stated that it did not wish 
  "to be taken to approve in any way the retention of corporal punishment as 
  part of the disciplinary regime of a school" (Judgment, paragraph 36). I 
  accept that that indication is very significant but it must have been seen in 
  the context of the case. The punishment was said not to be related to the 
  seriousness of the offence. It was carried out on a seven year old child by 
  the headmaster, whom the child did not know, three days after the offence. The 
  applicant's parents did not approve of corporal punishment administered by the 
  school. The applicant's case was that this system was to be distinguished from 
  "physical chastisement administered in the home where the parent might punish 
  the child for some immediate piece of naughtiness, but in the context of a 
  loving relationship with continuous physical contacts." The Strasbourg court 
  did not disclaim approval of all chastisement; it said nothing about 
  discipline outside schools. The correction in this case, to my mind, on the 
  evidence more nearly corresponds to that described above as administered in 
  the home. It does not involve a serious breach of personal integrity such as 
  led the Strasbourg court in <I>A v UK</I> (1998) 27 EHHR 611 to hold that 
  corporal punishment by the applicant's stepfather resulted in a violation of 
  article 3. Accordingly, I do not consider that it automatically follows that 
  the Strasbourg court would hold that a religious or other belief which entails 
  this form of correction is not worthy of recognition under the Convention.

  <LI value=237><A name=order237>Parents and others standing in loco parentis

  civil proceedings for assault, enjoy under our common law a defence if the 
  acts complained of constituted moderate and reasonable chastisement. In some 
  of the reported cases, the parent had not expressly authorised the person in 
  loco parentis to exercise this right. Nonetheless, the person in loco parentis 
  was deemed to have the right to impose moderate and reasonable chastisement. 
  No case has been cited to us which turned on express authority being given by 
  a parent for this purpose. </A>

  <LI value=238><A name=order238>The defence was sought to be removed from

  <P></P>
  <LI value=239><A name=order239>The Secretary of State has not suggested that 
  correction as proposed by the appellants would not be within the common law 
  defence of justification described above. Moreover, the Secretary of State 
  accepts that the appellant parents may apply corporal punishment at home at 
  the request of their children's schools. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=240><A name=order240>Nor has the Secretary of State suggested that 
  there are alternative methods of disciplining children which do not involve 
  any imposition of physical force but would yet satisfy the appellants' 
  religious beliefs. Examples might include detention or exclusion from school 
  altogether. However, at first sight, those forms of punishment would seem to 
  be inconsistent with the message of love and reconciliation, which the 
  appellants contend are at the heart of their religious beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Rights of the child</I></P>
  <LI value=241><A name=order241>The Secretary of State did not contend that the 
  administration of correction necessarily involved an infringement of any of 
  the rights of the child. Indeed it seems to me that it would be impossible to 
  do so so long as the defence of reasonable chastisement remains an 
  unchallenged part of the common law. I would observe that in this respect the 
  common law effectively treats the child as the property of the parent, so far 
  as reasonable chastisement by the parent is concerned, and the courts may one 
  day have to consider whether this is the right approach. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=242><A name=order242>So far as the Convention is concerned, the 
  Secretary of State has not contended that, if the parents had the right to 
  freedom of religion for which they contend, it would violate the child's 
  rights, contrary to article 17 of the Convention. If this were the case, it 
  would to my mind be difficult to see why such matters as ritual male 
  circumcision in other religions would not similarly be in violation of the 
  Convention. Be that as it may, it would appear from <I>Costello-Roberts v 
  UK</I>, above, that Strasbourg jurisprudence does not hold that the child's 
  consent is a prerequisite to corporal punishment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=243><A name=order243>On 4 October 2002 the Committee on the Rights

  that Convention. However, no reliance has been placed by the parties on the 
  United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has thus played no 
  part in this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=244><A name=order244>The Secretary of State has not contended that 
  correction would be contrary to the best interests of the child. The

  <LI value=245><A name=order245>Section 548 of the Education Act 1996 (as 
  amended) is set out in material part below. Section 548 does not say that 
  corporal punishment is unlawful. It provides that there is no longer any 
  automatic authority for a teacher or other member of staff of an educational 
  institution to apply corporal punishment. The position taken by section 548 is 
  understandable even in the absence of Strasbourg jurisprudence. There must be 
  many teachers in this day and age who would see corporal punishment as 
  unnecessary or a sign of failure or as inconsistent with their function as 
  role model adults. It is common ground between the parties that, by virtue of 
  section 548, teachers are no longer deemed to have authority to administer 
  corporal punishment by virtue of their position. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Importance of freedom of religion and competing values</I></P>
  <LI value=246><A name=order246>I now turn to article 9 of the Convention. The 
  presence of article 9 in the Convention is a recognition that human life does 
  not belong solely to the secular order. The Convention deems spiritual as well 
  as physical integrity to be worthy of protection. Were it otherwise, some of 
  the most significant aspects of man's existence would be sidelined. The 
  secular values of the Convention arguably owe their origin to the religious 
  thought, and to adherents of religion those values are not ends in themselves. 
  The Strasbourg court explained the role of freedom of religion, the value 
  placed on it by the Convention and its content thus in <I>Kokkinakis v 
  Greece</I> (1993) 17 EHRR 397:- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"31. As enshrined in article 9, freedom of thought, conscience 
    and religion is one of the foundations of a 'democratic society' within the 
    meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the 
    most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and of 
    their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, 
    agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a 
    democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on 
    it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual 
    conscience, it also implies inter alia, freedom 'to manifest [one's] 
    religion'. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence 
    of religious conviction. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>According to article 9, freedom to manifest one's religion is 
    not only exercisable in community with others, 'in public' and within the 
    circle of those whose faith one shares, but can also be asserted 'alone' and 
    'in private'; furthermore, it includes in principle the right to try to 
    convince one's neighbour, for example through 'teaching', failing which, 
    moreover, 'freedom to change [one's] religion or belief,' enshrined in 
    article 9, would be likely to remain a dead letter. "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=247><A name=order247>Religious beliefs can be a source of moral 
  values for a society, but religion, especially institutionalised religion, can 
  also be intolerant to non-believers (or other sects of the same religion). In 
  a society where different beliefs are held and where many people may hold no 
  religious beliefs, it is necessary for those who do hold such beliefs to 
  observe tolerance and moderation in the expression of their beliefs in the 
  public sphere. Thus those who have rights can also have responsibilities. The 
  expression of religious beliefs by one group may otherwise give rise to 
  conflict with another group holding different beliefs, or a group holding no 
  religious beliefs. It is not only the rights of those who have religious 
  beliefs which must be respected but also the rights of those who do not hold 
  such beliefs. A balance has to be drawn between different sections of society 
  and (as appears below) the Strasbourg organs have sought to do this by placing 
  a restrictive interpretation on the scope of the qualified right conferred by 
  article 9(1). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=248><A name=order248>There are also matters for which rules may be 
  laid down for the general good of society. These rules too may impact on the

  importance of such rules in article 9(2) to which the qualified right under 
  article 9(1) is subject. </A>

  <P><I>What is a religious belief? The court's function</I></P>
  <LI value=249><A name=order249>In paragraphs 40 to 46 of his judgment (set out 
  in full by Buxton LJ), the judge came to the conclusion that the appellants 
  were not asserting a religious belief. There were essentially two reasons for 
  this conclusion. First, he considered that their belief was really that one 
  form of discipline was more efficacious than another. In reaching this 
  conclusion, and consistently with it, he rejected the submission that the 
  appellants could have a philosophical conviction about corporal punishment (I 
  address this point more fully below). The judge's second reason for his 
  conclusion that the appellants were not asserting a religious belief was that, 
  while the appellants' belief in correction was in accordance with their faith, 
  it did not embody or define their faith. It was not one of the "articles of 
  faith". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=250><A name=order250>For their part, the appellants challenged the 
  power of the court to do more than accept from the appellants what their 
  beliefs comprised. Moreover, they resisted any suggestion that their belief in 
  correction had be an "article of faith", as the judge found. Accordingly, I 
  now turn to consider in more detail the court's function when it is asserted 
  that a belief qualifies for protection under article 9(1). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=251><A name=order251>I have already said that the court must 
  ascertain and comprehend the religious beliefs of the appellants. In my 
  judgment, it is a mixed question of fact and law whether a person has a 
  religious belief for the purpose of article 9. Thus the first step is for the 
  judge to make findings on the evidence as to what are the actual beliefs of 
  the complainant, so far as relevant. In most cases, this is a function to be 
  carried out by the trial judge though, for reasons I have explained, I have 
  amplified those findings. The second step is for the judge to decide whether 
  those beliefs constitute religious beliefs for the purposes of the Convention. 
  The latter is principally a question of law. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=252><A name=order252>As to the first step, it is a fallacy to oppose 
  that fact finding is the same jurisprudential process in every case. Bowen LJ 
  famously said that the state of a man's mind is as much a state of fact as his 
  digestion (<I>Edgington v Fitzmaurice</I> (1885) 29 Ch.D 459), but it does not 
  follow that the way in which a state of mind is to be found is the same as for 
  a straightforward biological fact. In the present case, one feature already 
  noted is the fact that religious texts cannot be read wholly literally. 
  Religious texts often form the basis from which adherents develop specific 
  beliefs. It is not the court's function to judge whether those beliefs are 
  fairly based on the passages said to support them. Its function at the 
  fact-finding stage is to decide what the beliefs are and whether they are 
  genuinely held by the complainant. The fact that the beliefs are based on 
  religious texts may help the court reach its decision on this factual issue. 
  The beliefs of the appellants in this case are supported by Biblical texts. 
  Accordingly, I do not consider that it was open to the judge on the evidence 
  to hold that their belief was in the efficacy of correction and for that 
  reason that their belief in correction was not a religious belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=253><A name=order253>Having determined what beliefs the complainants 
  actually hold, the court must decide as a matter of law whether the beliefs 
  constitute religious beliefs for the purpose of article 9. This is the second 
  step. I accept the submission of Mr Paul Diamond, for the appellants, that it 
  is no part of the function of the court to express any approval or disapproval 
  of those beliefs as religious beliefs. As the Strasbourg court observed in 
  <I>Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia v Moldova</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/860.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 13</a>, "in 
  principle, the right of freedom of religion for the purposes of the Convention 
  excludes assessment by the state of the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the 
  ways in which those beliefs are expressed" (judgment, paragraph 117). However, 
  the court has to ask itself whether the beliefs qualify for recognition for 
  the purposes of the Convention. Two points arise. First, the court has to be 
  satisfied that the appellants' beliefs are religious beliefs. Second, the 
  court must be satisfied that the beliefs sought to be protected are consistent 
  with the values embedded in the Convention. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=254><A name=order254>Convention jurisprudence does not define what a 
  religious belief is for the purposes of the Convention. Need it, for instance, 
  be, as domestic charity law requires, a monotheistic belief? Need it even be a 
  theistic belief at all? When it comes to asking what a religious belief is, it 
  is in my judgment important not to approach the issue through the spectacles 
  of a majoritarian belief. In a modern pluralist society, these issues must be 
  approached with tolerance and in a way which respects the diversity of man's 
  spiritual needs. That said, it is difficult to provide a satisfactory 
  definition of religion, but as it seems to me it must at minimum be a system 
  of beliefs relating to the divine, or to spiritual matters, which has points 
  of reference or values outside those of civic society. However, I express no 
  final view as to the meaning of "religion" for the purposes of article 9(1) as 
  the capacity of the appellants' beliefs to be religious beliefs has not been 
  challenged. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=255><A name=order255>In any given case there may also at this stage 
  be a question of fact as to whether the beliefs found at the first stage do in 
  fact form part of the belief system identified as a religion at the second 
  stage, but there is no issue of that nature here. Likewise, issues of fact may 
  be involved in the process of determining whether the acts of the state have 
  actually interfered with the applicant's beliefs (see the <I>Valsamis</I> 
  below) or whether particular acts actually express the applicant's belief for 
  the purposes of the <I>Arrowsmith</I> test, to which I refer below. These 
  latter questions, however, are separate from the question presently under 
  consideration, namely whether an applicant has a religious belief for the 
  purposes of article 9. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=256><A name=order256>As I have explained, Elias J in the present 
  case decided was that a belief in corporal punishment was not capable of 
  forming a religious belief for the purposes of the Convention because it was 
  not a central tenet of the appellants' beliefs. In my judgment, this 
  conclusion does not mean that the belief cannot be a religious belief for the 
  purposes of article 9. A court can say that a particular person does not hold 
  a religious belief. It can also say that a particular belief does not form 
  part of the belief system of a particular religion. These are unexceptionable 
  factual enquiries. However, in my judgment, there is no mandate for reading 
  into the Convention, as the judge did, a distinction between "articles" of 
  faith and other religious beliefs. There is no such distinction in the 
  Convention. The question whether a belief is an inessential requirement of a 
  faith is relevant to the application of the <I>Arrowsmith</I> case (see 
  below), not to the question whether the belief is a religious belief. </A>

  <LI value=257><A name=order257>That point leads to another point. A belief is 
  not incapable of being a religious belief simply because the same belief, if 
  held by a non-adherent, would not be a religious belief. It is for that reason 
  that I disagree with Buxton LJ's proposition (judgment, paragraph 33) that 
  "the infliction of corporal punishment expresses nothing as to the religion of 
  the inflicter". That issue has to be judged in the light of the inflicter's 
  beliefs, not by disregarding them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=258><A name=order258>However, there are forms of belief, religious 
  and otherwise, that are not desirable in a democratic society and there are 
  others which are even harmful to society. Accordingly, I would accept Mr 
  Diamond's submission that to be protected by article 9, a religious belief, 
  like a philosophical belief, must be consistent with the ideals of a 
  democratic society, and that it must be compatible with human dignity, 
  serious, important, and (to the extent that a religious belief can reasonably 
  be required so to be) cogent and coherent. The judge had not minded to accept 
  that there should be any limit on religious beliefs that could be recognised 
  (judgment, paragraph 58). On this I would for the reasons just given disagree 
  though I would accept that the conditions for recognition must not be set at a 
  level which would deprive minority beliefs of the protection that they are 
  obviously intended to have under the Convention. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=259><A name=order259>It has not been suggested that the belief of 
  the appellants in the present case would fail to meet those criteria, other 
  than compatibility with human dignity. That objection is primarily based on 
  the disclaimer of approval by the Strasbourg court in the 
  <I>Costello-Roberts</I> case. I have already dealt with that point. It seems 
  to me to be an over-generalisation to say that all physical chastisement will 
  always be incompatible with human dignity. It is clear that these appellants 
  take very great care to consider the child's interests and apply correction 
  for the purpose of reconciliation and forgiveness. As I have said, I do not 
  consider that their religious belief is automatically to be treated as 
  unworthy of protection because it entails physical contact and there is no 
  evidence put forward by the Secretary of State that this form is in fact 
  harmful to a child. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=260><A name=order260>It follows that I do not consider that a 
  religious belief can be disregarded simply because in some other cultures the 
  same practice would be regarded as part of a social or economic tradition. The 
  appellants say that correction is part of their religious belief. It is part 
  of their religious duty to bring up children in the fear of God and this 
  involves inculcating respect for authority. Indeed, it is one of the Ten 
  Commandments in the Old Testament of the Bible that children shall honour 
  their parents. This commandment is part of the duty to God. In other cultures, 
  the principle of authority might simply be seen as part of good social order, 
  but that does not mean to say that it is open to the court to recharacterise 
  the belief of the appellants as not being a religious belief in their case. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=261><A name=order261>In the present case, there is no issue as to 
  the appellants' motivation in seeking to apply or authorise correction. It is 
  accepted that they do so as a result of their beliefs. The Secretary of State 
  does not challenge the genuineness of their beliefs. In my view, to establish 
  a relevant religious belief, it is sufficient for the appellants to show, as 
  they have shown, that their belief in correction genuinely forms part of their 
  religious beliefs, and that that belief fulfils the criteria mentioned above. 
  In this I am in principle in agreement with Rix LJ. The appellants can also 
  show that an act for which the State is responsible, namely the maintenance of 
  a prohibition on corporal punishment in schools, impinges on those beliefs. 
  The next question is whether the State's action violates the qualified right 
  conferred by article 9(1), namely the right of a person "to manifest his 
  religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance". It is to 
  that issue that I now turn. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Interpretation by the Strasbourg organs of the qualified right conferred 
  by article 9 </I></P>
  <LI value=262><A name=order262>I have expressed the view above that the 
  Strasbourg organs have sought to draw a balance between different sections of 
  society by placing a restrictive interpretation on the scope of the qualified 
  right conferred by article 9(1). The authorities show that this has been done, 
  so far as relevant to this appeal, by holding: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>a) that person does not "manifest" his beliefs by practice when 
    he performs acts which are motivated by his beliefs but do not "actually 
    express" those beliefs (<I>Arrowsmith v UK</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/7.html">(1978) 3 EHRR 218</a>);</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>b) that a person who can take steps which will avoid any 
    conflict between his beliefs and those acts which he claims interfere with 
    those beliefs, or voluntarily accepts a regime which leads to such a 
    conflict, cannot complain of an interference with his freedom to manifest 
    his beliefs (see, for example, <I>Kala( v Turkey</I> (1997) 27 EHRR 552 and 
    <I>Stedman v UK </I>(1997) 23 EHRR CD 329). </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=263><A name=order263>These are distinct lines of jurisprudence but 
  they are interconnected and interwoven in the case law. They are not unified 
  by any express organising principle but, as I see it, there is a common 
  thread. As I read his judgment, Buxton LJ shares that general approach. In my 
  judgment, the common thread in these separate lines of jurisprudence is the 
  need to balance the interests of those holding religious beliefs on the one 
  hand with the interests of those who do not hold those beliefs (or who hold 
  other beliefs) on the other hand. It is of the essence of a pluralist society 
  that no group should have dominance over any other group (see above). I do not 
  intend to suggest that all the case law cited to us is capable of consistent 
  analysis in terms of the propositions I have set out above, but in my judgment 
  they support those propositions for the reasons given below. Accordingly, the 
  right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion cannot be relied upon as 
  automatically justifying immunity from generally applicable laws. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=264><A name=order264>I will examine these propositions in turn. The 
  origin of proposition (a) is <I>Arrowsmith v UK</I>, which has been at the 
  forefront of the Secretary of State's submissions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=265><A name=order265>The relevant complaint in <I>Arrowsmith</I> was 
  that the complainant's conviction under the Incitement to Disaffection Act 
  1934 violated her rights under article 9. The complainant was a pacifist. She 
  distributed leaflets to soldiers inciting opposition to government policy in 
  Northern Ireland. The pamphlets properly read did not as such express 
  pacifists beliefs. The European Commission on Human Rights ("the Commission") 
  held that there was no violation: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"71. The Commission considers that the term "practice" as 
    employed in article 9(1) does not cover each act which is motivated or 
    influenced by a religion or belief. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>It is true that public declarations declaring generally the idea 
    of pacificism and urging the acceptance of a commitment to non-violence may 
    be considered as a normal and recognised manifestation of religious belief. 
    However, when the actions of individuals do not actually express the belief 
    concerned they cannot be considered as protected by article 9(1), even when 
    they are motivated or influenced by it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=266><A name=order266>Accordingly, the <I>Arrowsmith </I>case 
  requires there to be shown that there is a direct link between the relevant 
  practice and the relevant belief. It follows that it is not enough for a 
  complainant to show that there is an indirect link and that he has chosen to 
  do something because of his beliefs: this would then be an act motivated or 
  influenced by his religious beliefs and not one directly expressing his 
  belief. The act must be one which his beliefs require him to carry out: on 
  this point of law, I am in agreement with Buxton LJ (judgment, paragraph 64). 
  The <I>Arrowsmith</I> test draws a distinction between acts which the beliefs 
  require to be performed and are integral to those beliefs and acts which are 
  merely inspired by the beliefs. It is not enough to make the acts 
  manifestations of religious beliefs that they are motivated or influenced by 
  the actor's religious beliefs. The further argument, based on article 10, of 
  the applicant was also rejected in the <I>Arrowsmith</I> case on the basis of 
  article 10(2). It may be that the <I>Arrowsmith </I>case more naturally falls 
  under article 10 than under article 9 (see <I>Vereiniguing Demokratischer 
  Soldaten Österreichs v Austria,</I> (1994) 20 EHRR 56 where the Strasbourg 
  court found a violation of article 10 with respect to the state's refusal to 
  distribute a journal aimed at soldiers). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=267><A name=order267>A person's freedom to manifest his religion may 
  be involved in (a) the wearing of religious dress (see <I>X v UK</I> (1978) 14 
  DR 234) where the Commission did not actually decide the point but based its 
  decision that there was no violation of article 9 on facts bringing the case 
  within article 9(2)); (b) the observance of dietary laws (see the <I>Jewish 
  Liturgical Association</I> case, where the Strasbourg court was content to 
  proceed on the basis of a concession); and (c) the practice of proselytism 
  (see, for example, <I>Kokkinakis v Greece</I>). In such circumstances the acts 
  in question actually express religious beliefs and are not merely motivated by 
  such beliefs. For example, in <I>Kokkinakis v Greece</I>, a Jehovah's Witness 
  was convicted of proselytism when he sought to persuade another person to 
  change faith. The Strasbourg court held that a Jehovah's Witness enjoyed the 
  status of a known religion. Accordingly, a Jehovah's Witness was entitled to 
  freedom of religion. Moreover, </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the 
    existence of religious convictions ... freedom to manifest one's religion 
    includes in principle the right to try to convince one's neighbour ..." 
    (paragraph 31).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=268><A name=order268>The <I>Arrowsmith</I> case leads to the 
  question, on the basis that religious motivation is not itself enough to bring 
  an act within article 9(1), whether to constitute "a practice" an act must in 
  itself be an action which would generally be regarded as one of a religious 
  nature. In <I>C v UK </I>(1983) 37 DR 144, the Commission said:- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Article 9 primarily protects the sphere of personal beliefs and 
    religious creeds, i.e. the area which is sometimes called the <I>forum 
    internum</I>. In addition, it protects acts which are intimately linked to 
    these attitudes, such as acts of worship or devotion, which are aspects of 
    the practice of religion or belief in a generally recognised 
  form."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=269><A name=order269>This passage does not purport to set out an 
  exhaustive definition of the type of activities which are protected by article 
  9(1). Moreover, it may be dealing only with worship or observance and not 
  "practice". Accordingly, I do not read this passage as imposing a limitation 
  on the meaning of "practice" for the purposes of article 9. I do not, 
  therefore, read it as meaning that a "practice" must be a practice in a 
  "generally recognised form". Any such limitation on a practice could only be 
  ascertained by imposing on a religious activity some majoritarian view as to 
  what could constitute a religious practice. This would seem to be contrary to 
  the intention of the Convention which is to protect minority beliefs. If there 
  were any concern that, without such a limitation, article 9 would otherwise 
  give protection to undesirable conduct which may adversely affect 
  non-adherents, I consider the position is adequately safeguarded by 
  proposition (b) and by the limitation accepted above on the types of religious 
  beliefs that qualify for protection under the Convention. The position is also 
  safeguarded by article 9(2). Furthermore, to limit protection under article 
  9(1) to acts which are not neutral as to their religious content would be to 
  ignore the point made earlier that many beliefs, and it follows many acts, are 
  distinguishable as religious beliefs, or it follows, religious practices, only 
  because of the belief of the actor. Thus a refusal by a person to eat say, 
  pork, would in my view be a manifestation of a religious belief if it was 
  contrary to the religious beliefs of the person in question to eat pork. But 
  it would not be the manifestation of a religious belief if the person refusing 
  to eat pork was not doing so out of religious conviction. It all turns on the 
  belief of the person in question. The fact that religious dietary laws have 
  been held to be protected by article 9, in my view, supports this conclusion. 
  Moreover, in the example I have given the act of refusal directly expresses 
  the belief for the purposes of the <I>Arrowsmith</I> test. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=270><A name=order270>The distinction which <I>Arrowsmith</I> draws 
  is not between acts which are obviously religious in character and those which 
  are only religious because of the motivation of the person performing them. 
  The distinction which <I>Arrowsmith</I> draws is between acts which a person 
  is actually required by his religious beliefs to carry out, and those which he 
  is not so required to perform but which are merely influenced, or motivated, 
  by his religious beliefs. The mere fact that an act, such as a refusal to eat 
  particular kinds of food, is one which from the external point of view is 
  neutral as to its religious content does not mean that it cannot constitute 
  the manifestation of a religious belief and that it acquires a religious 
  content only if it is motivated by religious belief. The <I>Arrowsmith</I> 
  test is directed to limiting the Convention right to acts actually required by 
  religious beliefs, as opposed to those which are merely inspired by such 
  beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=271><A name=order271>In my judgment, there is a perceptible, if 
  fine, distinction between (1) cases such as <I>X v UK</I> (cited by Buxton and 
  Rix LJJ) and <I>C v UK</I> (cited above), on the one hand, and (2) cases on 
  religious dress, dietary laws and proselytism on the other. In <I>X v UK</I>, 
  a pacifist, and in <I>C v UK, </I>a Quaker, sought exemption from the 
  obligation to pay taxes which might be used for military purposes. The 
  applicants claimed that their beliefs required them not to support weapons 
  procurement directly or indirectly. The Commission held that in each case 
  there was no violation of article 9(1). The Commission cited <I>Arrowsmith</I> 
  but based its decisions on the more general proposition that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"article 9 does not always guarantee the right to behave in the 
    public sphere in a way which is dictated by … a belief."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In other words, the Commission was influenced by the fact that the acts in 
  question would affect other members of society. In addition, the Commission 
  relied on the fact that the complaint related to the obligation to pay tax 
  which applied to all taxpayers and the fact that the state's right to impose 
  tax is recognised by article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention. The 
  latter point is special to the facts of <I>X v UK</I> and <I>C v UK </I>but 
  the former point, limiting behaviour in the public sphere, is of wider 
  application. However, it is not in general applicable to claims to express 
  religious belief through dress, or the observance of dietary laws, or the 
  proselytism within its proper bounds. The public is not generally involved in 
  these matters, though it may be (see, for example, <I>Karaduman v Turkey</I> 
  (1993) 74 DR 93, where University regulations requiring, as a condition of 
  issuing diploma certificates, that Muslim undergraduates should provide for 
  identification purposes, a photograph without a headcovering were held not to 
  violate article 9(1)). </P>
  <LI value=272><A name=order272>I now turn to my proposition (b). The 
  authorities show that those seeking to assert article 9(1) rights must 
  consider their individual position. Thus the Strasbourg court has held that 
  where a judge advocate in the Turkish air force had been required to retire 
  from the air force because of his conduct and attitude to Muslim 
  fundamentalism in breach of military discipline, there was no violation of 
  article 9(1) (<I>Kala( v Turkey</I> (1997) 27 EHRR 552). The Strasbourg court 
  held that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"in exercising his freedom to manifest his religion, an 
    individual may need to take his specific situation into account." (paragraph 
    27).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=273><A name=order273>When the applicant joined the air force he 
  necessarily accepted military discipline. The Strasbourg court noted that the 
  applicant was permitted to fulfil the normal duties of a Muslim, such as 
  praying five times a day. Again, the Commission has held that, where an 
  employee has been required to work on a day on which it would be contrary to 
  her religious beliefs to work, her article 9(1) rights were not violated 
  because it was open to her to resign her position (<I>Stedman v UK</I>; see 
  also <I>Konttinen v Finland</I> (Application No. 24949/94); and see <I>The 
  Jewish Liturgical Association </I>case (2000), <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/351.html">9 BHRC 27</a>, at paragraphs 80 – 
  83). There is a suggestion in <I>Konttinen</I> that <I>Kala...</I> is 
  authority for the proposition that only normal forms of religious worship or 
  devotion are protected by article 9(1), but this is not the basis on which 
  either <I>Kala(</I> or <I>Konttinen</I> was decided and I have already 
  addressed this point above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=274><A name=order274>In the <I>Jewish Liturgical Association,</I> 
  the applicant organisation, representing a number of Jews in France, were 
  refused a licence to perform the ritual slaughter of animals. This involves an 
  exemption from rules requiring animals to be stunned before slaughter. The 
  applicant contended that ritual slaughter performed by ritual slaughterers who 
  already had the appropriate licence did not conform to their religious 
  beliefs. The Strasbourg court rejected the claim that article 9 was violated. 
  Meat slaughtered in the way members of the applicant organisation required to 
  meet their beliefs could be obtained by importation or alternatively by 
  agreement with ritual slaughterers who already had licences and who could 
  perform the additional rites which members of the applicant organisation 
  required. The Strasbourg court accepted that the right to observe dietary laws 
  was part of those members' freedom to manifest their religion: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"73. The court next reiterates that article 9 lists a number of 
    forms which manifestation of one's religion or belief may take, namely 
    worship, teaching, practice and observance (see <I>Kala? v Turkey</I> 
    (Application no. 20704/92) (1 July 1997, unreported) (para. 27)). It is not 
    contested that ritual slaughter, as indeed its name indicates, constitutes a 
    rite or 'rite' (the word in the French text of the convention corresponding 
    to 'observance' in the English), whose purpose is to provide Jews with meat 
    from animals slaughtered in accordance with religious prescriptions, which 
    is an essential aspect of practice of the Jewish religion. The applicant 
    association employs ritual slaughterers and kashrut inspectors who slaughter 
    animals in accordance with its prescriptions on the question, and it is 
    likewise the applicant association which, by certifying as glatt kosher the 
    meat sold in its members' butcher's shops, exercises religious supervision 
    of ritual slaughter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>74. It follows that the applicant association can rely on 
    article 9 of the convention with regard to the French authorities' refusal 
    to approve it, since ritual slaughter must be considered to be covered by a 
    right guaranteed by the convention, namely the right to manifest one's 
    religion in observance, within the meaning of article 9."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=275><A name=order275>However, the Strasbourg court considered that 
  on the facts there was no interference with that freedom: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"80. In the court's opinion, there would be interference with 
    the freedom to manifest one's religion only if the illegality of performing 
    ritual slaughter made it impossible for ultra-orthodox Jews to eat meat from 
    animals slaughtered in accordance with the religious prescriptions they 
    considered applicable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>81. But that is not the case. It is not contested that the 
    applicant association can easily obtain supplies of glatt meat in Belgium 
  …"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=276><A name=order276>This line of authority is criticised by some 
  text including Clayton &amp; Tomlinson, <I>The Law of Human Rights</I>

  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"... in exercising his freedom of religion an individual may

    conclusion can be justified: it is strongly arguable that the court should 
    have found an interference and then gone on to consider "justification" 
    under article 9(2)." (para.14.46).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=277><A name=order277>The same point could be made with even more 
  force about the <I>Jewish Liturgical Association</I> case, above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=278><A name=order278>The point made by Clayton &amp; Tomlinson is 
  important in the present case because, as already stated, the Secretary of 
  State has not relied on article 9(2). Mr Keith recognises that it is too late 
  for the Secretary of State to rely on article 9(2) in the present case. 
  Counsel sought to argue before the judge that section 548 was justified under 
  article 9(2). The judge gave several reasons for refusing to take this step, 
  saying:- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I have no evidence before me as to why it was felt justifiable 
    to interfere with [any human rights of the parents]. Without such evidence 
    it is impossible to say whether the response was a proportionate. The court 
    cannot find justification simply on the basis of counsel's assertion as to 
    possible grounds which a state might be able to rely on to justify the 
    provisions in question." (Judgment, paragraph 60).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=279><A name=order279>In the absence of evidence directed to the 
  requirements of article 9(2), the Secretary of State does not have a fall-back 
  position in the event of the court reaching the conclusion that article 9(1) 
  was violated. The relevant issue would then be whether section 548 of the 
  Education Act 1996 interfered with the appellants' rights. On the face of it, 
  section 548 takes no account whatever of religious or philosophical beliefs it 
  may infringe. In <I>Kokkinakis v Greece</I>, above, there was a criminal 
  offence imposed on all forms of proselytism and the Strasbourg court held that 
  the applicant's right was violated because no distinction was drawn between 
  "proper" and "improper" proselytism. (That distinction is, of course, a 
  difficult one but the Strasbourg court did not have to grapple with it because 
  no attempt had been made to draw it by the national court.) </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=280><A name=order280>However, proposition (b) is undoubtedly 
  established by Strasbourg jurisprudence. On the face of it, proposition (b) is 
  harsh. However, in my judgment, it is to be justified by the common thread 
  identified above. I do not, therefore, consider that it is helpful to regard 
  these cases as a conflation of article 9(2) with the qualified right in 
  article 9(1). Instead it has to be recognised that a person's freedom to 
  manifest his religion for the purposes of article 9 is not absolute; it is not 
  a freedom to practice one's religion in any way a person pleases. The freedom, 
  being a freedom to be enjoyed in conjunction with others whose interests must 
  also be safeguarded, is of a negative kind in that it is a freedom to be free 
  from constraints other than those arising from a set of circumstances that the 
  complainant has accepted. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=281><A name=order281>This summary of Strasbourg jurisprudence is not 
  directed to the case where a constraint is imposed in a discriminatory 
  fashion, that is on persons only because they are adherents of religion or 
  adherents of a particular religion. The situation here is that section 548 of 
  the Education Act 1996 is generally applicable to all teachers. I do not 
  accept Mr Diamond's submission that because it is partial (in that it does not 
  for example apply to carers), it is not to be treated on a generally 
  applicable law. If section 548 were discriminatory, different considerations 
  would arise. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=282><A name=order282>I can conveniently deal with another point made 
  by Mr Diamond, namely that less significance should be attached to section 548 
  because it was in the relevant respect amendment pursuant to an amendment 
  proposed by a private member and with little debate. (One of the consequences 
  of its being a private member's amendment is that there was no requirement for 
  a ministerial statement of compatibility for the purpose of section 19 of the 
  Human Rights Act 1998). The fact is that section 548 represents the will of 
  the democratically elected legislature. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=283><A name=order283>I turn to another point. Buxton LJ has set out 
  passages from the judgments of the House of Lords in <I>R (o/a Pretty) v 
  DPP</I> <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/61.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/61.html">[2002] 1 AC 800</a></A> and of the Strasbourg Court in <I>Pretty</I> <I>v UK</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/427.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 1</a>. In that case, the belief relied on was a philosophical belief in 
  assisted suicide. She claimed that she was entitled to manifest those beliefs 
  by acting on them. It was not a case where the applicant contended that act in 
  question was a necessary requirement of her beliefs, and accordingly the 
  Strasbourg court, upholding the judgments of the House of Lords, held that her 
  beliefs did not pass the <I>Arrowsmith</I> test (Judgment, paragraph 82). In 
  my judgment, the <I>Kala?</I> approach would have been inapplicable in her 
  case. Accordingly, the judgments of the House of Lords and of the Strasbourg 
  court in the <I>Pretty</I> cases confirm that the <I>Arrowsmith</I> case 
  remains part of Strasbourg jurisprudence. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=284><A name=order284>In the light of my conclusions below, it is

  case</I></P>
  <LI value=285><A name=order285>I next turn to the question of the application 
  of the Strasbourg jurisprudence summarised above to the facts of this case. 
  The judge, having cited <I>Arrowsmith</I> held that the appellants' belief on 
  correction did not constitute a manifestation of a belief for the same reasons 
  essentially as he gave for holding that it was not a belief at all (judgment, 
  paragraph 54). I have addressed those reasons above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=286><A name=order286>Buxton LJ has also held that the appellants' 
  imposition of correction constitutes neither a "practice" nor the 
  manifestation of a belief, as opposition to acts motivated by a belief 
  (judgment, paragraph 35). The former turns on the lack of clarity in the 
  appellants' belief. I addressed the question of lack of clarity when dealing 
  with the appellants' belief at the outset of this judgment. In my judgment, 
  the imposition of "correction" constitutes no less a "practice" in this case 
  than the observance of dietary laws, rules as to dress and the practice of 
  proselytism in those cases where the Strasbourg organs have accepted that a 
  qualified right under article 9(1) existed. There is no logical or principled 
  distinction that can be drawn between these various ways in which religious 
  beliefs are externalised. Unlike the particular pamphlets in 
  <I>Arrowsmith</I>, the act in question is a specific requirement of the 
  complainants' religious beliefs. On the basis of the evidence and arguments in 
  this case, the public sphere is not adversely affected by the practice by the 
  appellants of their beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=287><A name=order287>The argument of Mr Keith was as follows. First, 
  the appellants failed to show that the correction is an essential aspect of 
  their religious beliefs. For the reasons already given, I consider that the 
  appellants have shown that it is part of their religious beliefs that they 
  have a duty to God to bring up their children using correction in appropriate 
  circumstances. It is thus not an optional aspect of their beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=288><A name=order288>Second, Mr Keith submits that correction is 
  merely an act which is motivated or influenced by religious beliefs: it does 
  not actually express those beliefs. I have already found that it is part of 
  the appellants' religious beliefs that they should apply correction if the 
  circumstances warrant it. By sending their children to schools providing 
  education on the express basis of Christian principles conforming with their 
  own, the appellant parents are evincing their desire that their own duty to 
  bring up their children in the Christian faith is carried out by the 
  children's school when the children are at school. The authority which they 
  seek to give those schools to apply correction, which is authority to 
  administer correction strictly in conformity with their beliefs, and the 
  administration of such correction is, in my judgment, part and parcel of the 
  "practice" by appellants of what they believe for the purposes of article 9. 
  The question is whether in practising what they believe in this way they would 
  be recognised as manifesting their beliefs for the purposes of article 9(1). 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=289><A name=order289>Since the appellant parents have established 
  that their beliefs <I>require</I> them to bring up their children using 
  correction where appropriate, the <I>Arrowsmith</I> argument does not in my 
  judgment assist the Secretary of State. In carrying out the upbringing of 
  their children in accordance with their faith, the appellant parents are 
  actually expressing their beliefs. The conduct which the appellants claim is a 
  manifestation of their beliefs does not affect society generally or the public 
  sphere since the correction would be administered in the home or at school. 
  These schools are not in the state sector. They have been founded on the basis 
  of the principles of the beliefs which the appellants hold, and correction is 
  a matter on which parents of children at the schools and teachers are agreed. 
  In my conclusion on the <I>Arrowsmith</I> point I am in agreement with Rix LJ, 
  save with respect to the Liverpool School. The appellant teachers share the 
  parents' beliefs, but in the present case their role is only as delegates of 
  the parents and accordingly they cannot have Convention rights if the 
  appellant parents do not. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=290><A name=order290>There is one qualification I would make to 
  this. While the Liverpool School say that delayed correction is "unworkable" 
  and that immediate correction is therefore "Biblically correct", in the light 
  of the other evidence I do not myself accept that a system whereby parents 
  administer correction, either at home or at school, cannot be made to work. In 
  the case of the Liverpool school, I conclude that their belief in immediate 
  correction, while a religious belief, is not a non-optional aspect of their 
  beliefs. On this basis, immediate correction done by a teacher would not be a 
  "manifestation" of a religious belief within the <I>Arrowsmith</I> test. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=291><A name=order291>Mr Keith's next argument is that the imposition 
  of correction would not express any belief at all. It is true that the same 
  act, if performed by a non-adherent of the appellants' faith, would by its 
  nature not express any religious belief. However, the fact that, when 
  performed by the appellants, it is performed in exercise of their religious 
  beliefs is not a fact which can be ignored in determining whether article 
  9(1). Accordingly, I would reject this argument also. I consider that the 
  situation is in this respect indistinguishable from acts which Mr Keith was 
  prepared to accept as acts expressing religious beliefs, namely the wearing of 
  turbans and ritual circumcision. These acts (when performed by adherents) 
  constitute the manifestation of religious belief. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=292><A name=order292>Mr Keith invites the court to make a value 
  judgment and hold that the appellants' desire to authorise schools to carry 
  out correction is not the manifestation of religious belief. This argument 
  springs not from section 548 of the Education Act 1996, but the trend of 
  Strasbourg case law in which he submits is moving in the direction of an 
  outright ban on corporal punishment. In my judgment, this is not an invitation 
  to which the court should accede. The court should not be tempted to water 
  down article 9(1) rights by reference to a conclusion which has not yet, and 
  might never be, reached by the Strasbourg court. I say nothing about the 
  position if the Secretary of State had chosen to rely on the rights of the 
  child. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=293><A name=order293>That leaves proposition (b) above and the 
  question whether the appellant parents can show there is no choice open to 
  them which would avoid a conflict between section 548 and their religious 
  beliefs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=294><A name=order294>In the present case, the correction need not be 
  applied by the teachers. It can be done, as it is at present by the Emmanuel 
  School, Rochdale and the King's School Senior, Hampshire (bundle, pages 75 and 
  80), by a parent at the school's request, either at home or at school. Save in 
  the case of the Liverpool school, that is in accordance with the appellant 
  parents' religious beliefs. The parents and schools between them can agree on 
  the way in which correction ought to be carried out so that the aspects of 
  love and reconciliation are observed when the parent carries out correction 
  just as much as it would be if the school carried it out. No doubt, it is more 
  convenient for parents to authorise the school, but convenience alone does not 
  justify a Convention right. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=295><A name=order295>The beliefs of the Liverpool school require 
  that correction be applied immediately and thus in the school context. As 
  already explained, I do not consider that the Convention right of the teachers 
  can be wider than that of the parents. So far as parents hold this belief, 
  then my answer is that the law requires them to make a choice between sending 
  their children to a school, as opposed to educating their children themselves 
  at home, and carrying out their religious beliefs in this respect. Harsh 
  though the application of proposition (b) may seem, in my judgment it is 
  required by Convention case law. I do not consider that it would be 
  appropriate to depart from the Strasbourg case law in this respect. Such a 
  course would be justified only in exceptional circumstances which do not exist 
  here. The appellants can avoid a conflict between their beliefs and a statute 
  which is generally applicable and which the democratically elected legislature 
  has enacted for the good of society. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=296><A name=order296>For the above reasons, in my judgment, the 
  appellant parents have failed to show their wish to authorise schools to carry 
  out correction constitutes an interference with their freedom to manifest 
  their religious beliefs for the purposes of article 9(1). Had the beliefs been 
  philosophical, rather than religious, the result would have been the same. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=order2><I>Article 2 of the First Protocol</I> </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=297><A name=order297>Article 2 of the First Protocol provides:- </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"No person shall be denied the right to education. In the 
    exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to 
    teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such 
    education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and 
    philosophical convictions."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>Respect for parents' rights</I></P>
  <LI value=298><A name=order298>I now turn to article 2 of the First Protocol. 
  If I am correct thus far that the appellants' belief is a religious belief for 
  the purposes of article 9, it must similarly be a religious conviction for the 
  purposes of article 2 of Protocol No.1. The issue is then whether or not the 
  state has failed to give "respect" to their belief. In this context, it is 
  established that "respect" means more than "acknowledge" or "take into 
  account" (<I>Valsamis v Greece</I>, above, paragraph 27). As I see it, in 
  order to respect religious beliefs, the state must not interfere with them to 
  a disproportionate extent. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=299><A name=order299>Elias J relied on <I>Valsamis v Greece 
  </I>(1996) 24 EHRR 294 which Rix LJ has summarised. The decision in that case 
  that no breach of article 9 was involved turns on the fact that the Strasbourg 
  court could "discern nothing, either in the purpose of the parade or in the 
  arrangements for it, which could offend the applicants' pacifist convictions 
  to an extent prohibited by the second sentence of article 2 of Protocol No.1." 
  (judgment, paragraph 31). The Strasbourg court relied on this passage in 
  reaching the conclusion that the obligation to take part in the school parade 
  was not such as to offend the applicant's parents' religious convictions 
  (paragraph 37). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=300><A name=order300>Like Buxton LJ (judgment, paragraph 60), I do 
  not accept the submission of Mr Keith, which was accepted by the judge 
  (judgment, paragraphs 52 and 53), that the only way in which the obligation on 
  the state to respect religious beliefs is broken is if the pupil is subjected 
  to indoctrination inconsistent with those beliefs. Since article 2 of Protocol 
  No.1 extends to matters of discipline, as well as those of curriculum content, 
  indoctrination can be no more than one of the ways in which the obligation on 
  the state can be broken. Indoctrination was a relevant issue in 
  <I>Valsamis</I> because the case involved the question whether a sanction 
  could be imposed by the school for failure to observe curriculum requirements. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=301><A name=order301>In the present case, a religious belief which, 
  in my judgment, has been shown is that of the parents. It is their belief that 
  they have a Christian duty to chastise their children, and to ensure that 
  their schools chastise them, in appropriate circumstances. So far as the 
  teachers of their children are concerned, in my judgment, they are concerned 
  only as delegates of the parents. Even if section 548 on its true construction 
  forbids delegation by parents of their rights to impose reasonable 
  chastisement on their children to the teachers of the children, the state has 
  not acted inconsistently with the parents' belief in so far as the parents can 
  still impose reasonable chastisement. In addition, the parents can still teach 
  the child outside school that correction is part of the Christian duty of a 
  parent. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=302><A name=order302>The Strasbourg jurisprudence establishes that 
  the state can regulate the provision of education. By section 548 the state 
  has sought to regulate the provision of education by prohibiting the 
  imposition of corporal punishment by teachers, and it has now done so in a 
  manner which applies equally to all schools. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=303><A name=order303>Furthermore, under Strasbourg jurisprudence, 
  the child has a fundamental right to education. It is also established that 
  parents cannot insist on respect for their convictions if those convictions 
  conflict with the child's fundamental right to education. Since a child can 
  only receive education in a school in an environment where corporal punishment 
  is prohibited, the parents would be denying their children the right to 
  education if they insisted that their children had to go to schools that would 
  impose corporal punishment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=304><A name=order304>Accordingly, in my judgment, in agreement with 
  Buxton LJ but in disagreement with Rix LJ, section 548 does not violate 
  article 2 of the First Protocol. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>"philosophical conviction"</I></P>
  <LI value=305><A name=order305>The question arises whether, if the appellants' 
  belief is not a religious belief, it is nonetheless a "philosophical 
  conviction" for the purposes of article 2 of Protocol No. 1, but in the 
  circumstances I can deal with the point briefly. The argument of the Secretary 
  of State is that a belief in corporal punishment can never be a "philosophical 
  conviction" for this purpose. This was also the view of the judge. If I am 
  correct in the views expressed above as to what is a religious belief, then in 
  my judgment the same beliefs, differing only in the respect that they do not 
  qualify as "religious", must be capable of constituting "philosophical 
  convictions", providing that they form part of a belief system that can 
  properly be described as a philosophy. In this conclusion, I am in agreement 
  with Rix LJ. </A>

  <P></P>
  <LI value=306><A name=order306>Section 548 of the Education Act 1996 (as 
  amended) provides in material part as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(1) Corporal punishment given by, or on the authority of, a

    given in pursuance of a right exercisable by the member of staff by virtue 
    of his position as such.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Subsection (1) applies to corporal punishment so given to a 
    child at any time, whether at the school or other place at which education 
    is provided for the child, or elsewhere.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The following provisions have effect for the purposes of 
    this section.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(4) Any reference to giving corporal punishment to a child is to 
    doing anything for the purpose of punishing that child (whether or not there 
    are other reasons for doing it) which, apart from any justification, would 
    constitute battery.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(5) However, corporal punishment shall not be taken to be given

  averting:</BLOCKQUOTE>

      place at which education is provided for the child,

      <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) otherwise provides his services there (whether or not 
        for payment),</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>and has lawful control or charge of the child.</P>
  <P>(7) "Child" (except in subsection (8)) means a person under the age of 18 
  …"</P>
  <LI value=307><A name=order307>In my judgment, this removes the defence of 
  justification on one ground, namely the position as teacher (or other staff 
  member of an educational institution) of the person applying the corporal 
  punishment. It does not remove the other defences, such as justification on 
  the grounds of self-defence (this is within section 548(5)). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=308><A name=order308>The judge's view was that this formula was 
  sufficient to prevent a defence of justification even where the right to give 
  corporal punishment did not simply derive from his position as a teacher but 
  also from express permission given to him by the parents (judgment, paragraph 
  28). In my judgment, the judge was correct. The case law has already been 
  examined by Buxton LJ. None of the cases cited to us is authority for the 
  proposition that delegation between parent and teacher occurs in a purely 
  contractual sense. The teacher's authority to apply corporal punishment at 
  common law arose by operation of law. A parent cannot simply by contract 
  authorise a third party to decide whether, when or how to chastise his child. 
  That would amount to authority to commit a battery when the third party chose. 
  If that proposition were not correct, a parent could confer the defence of 
  justification on anyone, not just a teacher. The authority to apply corporal 
  punishment under the common law is given to the parent, and he cannot delegate 
  the discretion to apply it to a third party. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=309><A name=order309>It may be different if a parent decides that 
  particular conduct merited a particular form of corporal punishment, no 
  greater than reasonable chastisement, and then asks a third party to impose 
  this punishment in his stead. I agree with the judge, however, that the words 
  "by virtue of his position as such" are wide enough to cover both the case 
  where the teacher relies on his own inherent authority under the common law 
  and where a parent authorises the child's teacher to carry out corporal 
  punishment on a particular occasion because of conduct which offends against 
  the school's code of behaviour. The teacher in imposing correction would still 
  be purporting to exercise a right exercisable "by virtue of his position as 
  such", the only difference being that he does so with the parent's consent. I 
  need not deal with the situation where a parent asks a teacher to impose 
  correction on a particular occasion because there is no evidence that that 
  situation occurs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=order4><I>Additional matters</I> </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Article 3 of the Convention</I></P>
  <LI value=310><A name=order310>Article 3 of the Convention provides: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"No-one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading 
    treatment or punishment."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=311><A name=order311>Mr Keith does not submit that the form of 
  correction sought to be used by the appellants is of itself "degrading ... 
  punishment" contrary to article 3 of the Convention. In order to violate 
  article 3, the correction would have to reach "a minimum level of severity" 
  (<I>Costello-Roberts v</I> <I>UK</I>, above). The assessment of this minimum 
  level depends on all the circumstances of the case, including the nature and 
  context of the punishment, the manner and method of its execution, its 
  duration, its physical and mental effects and in some instances the sex, age 
  and state of health of the victim (see <I>Costello-Roberts v UK</I>, above). 
  Accordingly, there is a fact-sensitive line between correction which violates 
  article 3 and correction which does not do so. However, as I have said, the 
  Secretary of State has not sought to contend in this case that the particular 
  form of correction proposed to be used by these appellants would violate 
  article 3, and, as I have said, no reliance is placed on that as a 
  justification for State intervention under article 9(2) of the Convention. In 
  those circumstances, the opinion of the UN Human Rights Committee in General 
  Comment 7 (1982) on article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
  Political Rights, that the prohibition (in like terms to article 3) on torture 
  and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment "must extend to 
  corporal punishment", which Mr Keith draws to our attention, though important, 
  is not relevant to this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention</I></P>
  <LI value=312><A name=order312>I agree with Buxton and Rix LJJ about the 
  application to this case of article 8 and with Buxton LJ on article 10 of the 
  Convention. I have nothing to add. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><I>Section 13 of the Human Rights Act 1998</I></P>
  <LI value=313><A name=order313>In support of his submission that section 548 
  did not prohibit correction in this case, Mr Diamond relied on section 13 of 
  the Human Rights Act 1998, which is set out by Buxton LJ in his judgment. We 
  have not heard full argument on section 13. The appellants are not a religious 
  organisation and do not advance this appeal on the basis that they are the 
  members collectively of any religious organisation. On that basis, section 13 
  cannot be invoked. Moreover, section 13 applies only if there is a question 
  under the 1998 Act as to the <I>exercise</I> of a Convention right and I am 
  doubtful whether on its true interpretation section 13 can apply so as to 
  produce a different result in this case where under Strasbourg jurisprudence 
  there has been no interference with the right under article 9 for the reasons 
  given above. Further, it is possible that section 13 applies only where there 
  is a conflict between the Convention right of a religious organisation or its 
  members collectively on the one hand and a Convention or other right of 
  another person on the other hand (and in the case of conflict with another 
  person's Convention right, provisionally it seems to me that the court would 
  be bound pursuant to section 3 of the 1998 Act to construe section 13 itself 
  so far as possible in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights of 
  both parties). In this case, the only question for determination under the 
  1998 Act is whether, pursuant to section 3 of the 1998 Act, section 548 of the 
  1996 Act is to be interpreted in a way which is compatible with the 
  appellants' Convention rights under article 9. In the circumstances it is 
  unnecessary for me to express a final view but my provisional view is that, 
  since I have held that the appellants have not established violation of a 
  Convention right under article 9, section 3 of the 1998 Act does not apply and 
  so for that reason also section 13 does not assist the applicants. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=314><A name=order314>Accordingly I would dismiss this appeal. In the 
  circumstances it is unnecessary to deal with the respondent's notice filed by 
  the Secretary of State, which contains grounds for upholding the judge's 
  interpretation of section 548 based on its parliamentary history. </A>
