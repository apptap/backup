JUSTICE BUTLER-SLOSS:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">1.	
The appellant is the brother of the first respondent. The second to seventh
respondents are six of the eight sons of the first respondent and lived with
him at the relevant time. The brothers and their respective families were
engaged in a bitter family quarrel, originating in a dispute over land in
Pakistan from which both families came. The violent strife between the brothers
continued in this country where both families reside. The appellant&#8217;s
case was that, as a result of the land dispute, the first respondent and his
sons subjected the appellant and his family to a campaign of systematic
terrorisation and violence. Tyres were slashed and a property in Reading broken
into, vandalised and set on fire. Two of the first respondent's sons were
convicted of vandalising windows at the home of the appellant. The appellant
alleged serious assaults on himself and an assault on his daughter. The assault
on the appellant caused serious injuries requiring hospital admission. The
second respondent, (one of the sons), has been charged with causing grievous
bodily harm. The daughter obtained an injunction in civil proceedings. Threats
to cause serious injury and to burn down his home have been made to the
appellant. He alleged that the first respondent was party to and was
master-minding these attacks by his sons.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">2.
	The
first respondent agreed that there was a continuing dispute over land in
Pakistan, but he denied the allegations of a campaign of terrorisation and
violence. He alleged that it was the appellant who subjected his family to
terrorisation and violence and he, the first respondent, was badly injured in
an incident in Pakistan on the 11th June 1997, as a result of which the
appellant was charged with attempted murder. That information was not disclosed
by the appellant in his first affidavit. After it was alleged in  the first
respondent&#8217;s affidavit, the incident was admitted but the offence was
denied in the appellant&#8217;s second affidavit.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">3.
	This
deplorable tale of family warfare came first before a deputy District Judge ex
parte on the 3rd July 1998 on applications brought under the provisions of Part
IV of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act 1996</A>, (the 1996 Act), <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s33.html">sections 33</A> and <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">42</A>. He made
orders for non-molestation against all the respondents, orders that they should
not go within 100 yards of the appellant&#8217;s house and added a power of
arrest to both orders to remain in  force until the 13th July. It is not
entirely  clear from the orders made on the 13th July by His Honour Judge
Holden the extent of those orders against each individual respondent. The
appellant and the first respondent only were legally represented. It seems that
he continued both sets of injunctions against all the respondents to remain in
force until the 13th July 1999 in respect of three sons. He attached a power of
arrest to remain in force against all the respondents until 13th November 1998.
He adjourned the matter to the 26th August. The applications, the subject of
this appeal, were heard by His Honour Judge Kenny on the 26th August 1998.
Almost all the facts were in issue and the parties were ready to give evidence.
Judge Kenny had read the papers and decided to deal with the matter on the
basis that the appellant&#8217;s evidence was true, relying upon the written
evidence before him. On  that basis, he accepted that the case came within the
jurisdiction of the 1996 Act. He also accepted that prima facie, if the
jurisdiction was invoked, the appellant had made out a case against the first
and sixth respondents and an order would be likely to be granted.  Nonetheless,
in the exercise of his discretion, he refused to hear oral evidence or to make
an order against the first respondent. He discharged the order against the
sixth respondent.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">4.	
His conclusion was that:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	
"the civil jurisdiction, the civil route for the present dispute between  the
parties, is appropriate, and not the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act</A>." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">He
gave four reasons:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	A.	He
regarded the family relationship as incidental to the dispute between the
parties.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	B.	The
dispute was essentially civil and not family. The <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act</A> provided no
relief for disputes over assault, trespass or damage to goods and he did not
consider that the court should countenance proceedings in separate
jurisdictions in respect of the same subject matter. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	C.	By
the provisions of <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s47.html">section 47</A>(2) if the court makes an occupation or
non-molestation order the court has little option but to attach a power of
arrest to one or more provisions of the order. The judge considered that this
draconian power, which was designed for the protection of vulnerable people
such as women and children would be an unsuitable weapon in the hands of the
appellant. It would give him "a very remarkable and ....unacceptable power over
the respondents.." This was particularly so in the case of the first and sixth
respondents who disputed the case, unlike the other sons who had not attended
nor objected to the ex parte orders. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	D.	The
advantage of civil proceedings would be that the appellant would have to pay
the costs if he lost and he would therefore have to give responsible
consideration to the question whether the proceedings were justified.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">5.	At
the end of his judgment, the judge added that if any application was to be made
by any of the other respondents to discharge the ex parte orders, he would
grant it. He was prepared to consider whether injunctive relief should be
granted if the appellant started civil proceedings. The appellant appealed to
this Court.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">6.	Although
the judge refused to make or continue non-molestation orders in August 1998,
for reasons which have not been gone into, the appeal was not heard by this
Court until February 1999. Since August 1998 there appears to have been no
further violence. The incidents are stale and tension between the parties has
eased. Counsel for the appellant, who was not present below, agreed that in the
circumstances it was not now appropriate to seek non-molestation orders. He
recognised that an application for an occupation order under <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s33.html">section 33</A> ought
not to be made since the appellant and the respondents did not occupy the same
house nor was any claim made by any of the respondents in respect of the
appellant&#8217;s home. He also accepted that, on the evidence before the
judge, there was not sufficient to make a case for an order against the sixth
respondent whose involvement was obviously peripheral if he was involved at
all. We dismissed the appeal as against the sixth respondent.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">7.	We
were however urged to hear the appeal against the judge&#8217;s refusal to
entertain an application under the 1996 Act against the first respondent (the
brother), partly at least, in the event of further incidents between the
parties, to give guidance whether it would be appropriate to invoke this
jurisdiction. We reserved our decision.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">8.	The
ambit of this jurisdiction has not yet been tested, but this is not an appeal
in which it would be appropriate to lay down general guidelines. There is now
no need for the appellant to apply for relief and the failure of the appellant
to obtain an order last August appears to have had a calming effect upon the
wider family. But I consider that it would be helpful for  the parties to the
present unusual appeal to know whether the 1996 Act would be the most suitable
jurisdiction to invoke if the appellant were to seek protection in the future.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">9.	The
relevant sections of <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">the Act</A> come within Part IV which is headed Family Homes
and Domestic Violence. The statutory framework of Part IV covers, inter alia,
rights to occupy the matrimonial home, non-molestation orders and the power of
arrest for breaches of orders. A court may make a non-molestation order if an
application for the order has been made:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"by
a person who is associated with the respondent;" (section 42(2). 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
<A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s62.html">section 62</A>(3):-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	
"a person is associated with another person if... 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(d)
they are relatives;" 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">"Relative"
in relation to a person means:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(b)
"the brother, sister, ..... niece or nephew (whether of the full blood or of
the half blood or by affinity) of that person...(section 63 (1)). 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
judge was therefore right to find that there was jurisdiction in the present
case to make orders under the 1996 Act.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">10.
	In
<A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A>(2)(b) the court may make a non-molestation order:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"if
in any family proceedings to which the respondent is a party the court
considers that the order should be made for the benefit of any other party to
the proceedings..."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s47.html">Section
47</A>(2) states that:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"If-<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(a)
the court makes a relevant order; and
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(b)
it appears to  the court that the respondent has used or threatened violence
against the applicant ....,
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	it
shall attach  a power of arrest to one or more provisions of the order unless
satisfied that in all the circumstances of the case the applicant or child will
be adequately protected without such power of arrest."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
court is not obliged to make a non-molestation order, but if it does do so, it
appears clear from the wording of <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s47.html">Section 47</A>(2) that it will, in all but
exceptional circumstances, be obliged to include a power of arrest in the order. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">11.	
In my judgment the judge&#8217;s first and fourth reasons for refusing to make
an order are not sustainable. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Reason
A. 
	Although
the dispute between the parties is in origin about land, it is patently
over-laid and magnified by the family relationship, which has fuelled and kept
alive the original disagreement. The depth of the dissension and the violent
reaction of both sides must owe a great deal to family ill-feeling. The
judge&#8217;s conclusion that the family relationship was incidental flew in
the face of the evidence of the serious and violent escalation in 1998 of the
family involvement in the land dispute. The report of the Law Commission (Law
Com. No 207) on Family Law Domestic Violence and Occupation of the Family Home,
set out in Part III their research and conclusions on the need for a broader
approach to providing protection by way of non-molestation orders within the
family context. At para 3.16:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"...in
the context of family proceedings it has come to be recognised that violence
and molestation within family relationships need to be treated as a special
case."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">At
para 17:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"The
need to extend the scope of injunctions in family  proceedings beyond the scope
of the law of tort has been explained by reference to the special nature of
family relationships. When problems arise in close family  relationships, the
strength of emotions involved can cause unique reactions which may at times be
irrational or obsessive. Whilst these reactions may most commonly arise between
spouses and cohabitants, they can also occur in many other close relationships
which give rise to similar stresses and strains and in  which the people
concerned will often continue to be involved with one another. The object of
the law should be to provide a framework to enable people in  this situation to
continue their relationship in a civilised fashion."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">12.
	The
conclusion of the Law Commission was to favour the third choice suggested by
them in their consultation exercise, that is to say, to widen the range of
applicants to include anyone who is associated with the respondent by virtue of
a family  relationship or something closely akin to such a relationship. That
proposal was enacted in the 1996 Act in <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">sections 42</A>(2), <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s62.html">62</A>(3) and <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s63.html">63</A>(1)(supra).
Although in the present case the brothers and their families do not live
together, it is clear that they continued to be deeply involved in the family
dispute, at least during last year. It follows that the dispute between the
brothers and the nephews is not only technically but genuinely within the ambit
of Part IV of the 1996 Act, and if that jurisdiction is not to be exercised, it
must be for reasons other than the first reason advanced by the judge.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">13.
	Reason
D.  The financial implications of requiring civil rather than family
proceedings would have had more weight if the appellant were in a financial
position to pay costs or would be asked to give an undertaking as to damages.
He is, I understand, in receipt of legal aid and probably would also therefore
obtain legal aid if a civil action had been begun on the same facts. Equally he
would be most unlikely to be asked for an undertaking in  damages in view of
his financial circumstances.  Consequently there appears to be no extra
financial constraint on the appellant in the conduct of civil proceedings. That
reason is therefore of little weight on  the present facts, although it might
be an important consideration in some cases.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">14.
	Reasons
B and C do, however, raise matters of far greater substance and, if the judge
was right in his conclusions, his decision was an eminently sensible one. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Reason
B. 
	We
were told by Mr Szerard for the appellant, who did not appear below, that the
appellant has not taken any steps to issue civil proceedings even though he was
unsuccessful before the judge in the 1996 Act application. Counsel&#8217;s
instructions were also that there was no intention evinced at the hearing to
initiate civil litigation and there were no grounds upon which the judge could
come to the contrary conclusion.  Despite what we were told, it is clear from
the judgment that the judge believed that the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A> application was the
first shot in a much more prolonged campaign which would include claims for
damages for assault, trespass to land and damage to goods, relief which is not
available under the 1996 Act and which  would require the institution of
separate civil proceedings. The detailed allegations set out in the
appellant&#8217;s two statements which went far beyond what was necessary for a
non-molestation order gave support to the judge&#8217;s view. I am far from
satisfied that Counsel who appeared for Mr Chechi before the judge did not give
the judge the impression that there might well be further civil litigation.
This is an experienced judge and he clearly had the impression that there would
be further proceedings. He said at page 4 of his judgment:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"It
does not seem right to me that the Court should countenance proceedings in
separate jurisdictions in  respect of the same subject matter. Where
proceedings in one jurisdiction are more appropriate, that is where they should
be brought."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Counsel
who then represented the appellant did not rise at the end of the judgment to
correct the judge&#8217;s impression that there would be further proceedings.
If the judge was right, it would be a waste of court time and of legal aid to
have two bites at the cherry. On the basis of his understanding of the position
at the hearing, he was entitled to come to that conclusion, although it would
have been much better if he had recited in his judgment what he had been told
by Counsel as to his client&#8217;s intentions. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">15.	
Reason C.
	
This issue raises the question whether, if the  relevant facts were proved, the
judge was obliged to make an order under the 1996 Act or whether he erred in
the exercise of his discretion in refusing to make an order. The only previous
decision on the ambit of <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A> which  was brought to our attention was 
<U>C
v C 
</U>(Non-Molestation
Order: Jurisdiction) [1998] 1 FLR 554. In that case the conduct of the former
husband was criticised in the daily and Sunday press during proceedings after
the divorce. The former husband obtained an ex parte order forbidding the
former wife, inter alia, to procure publication of any account of personal or
financial matters during the marriage. At the inter partes hearing Sir Stephen
Brown, P. discharged the injunction and said at page 557:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"It
is significant, in my judgment, that <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A> is to be found in Part IV of
the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act 1996</A> which is concerned with the general topic of domestic
violence. In this particular case the marriage between  these parties has been
finally  ended;  they are quite separate individuals,  and the material
complained of is some alleged revelations by the former wife of what she
regarded as her former husband&#8217;s misconduct."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">It
would appear that the President did not have drawn to his attention that the
definition of a person who is associated with the respondent includes those who
have been married to each other, (section 62(3)(a)) or those who are former
cohabitants, (section 62(3)(b)). The Act is certainly available to protect a
divorced spouse from harassment by the former husband or wife.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">16.	The
conclusion of the President was that the material came nowhere near molestation
as envisaged by <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act</A>. I respectfully agree with the
President that the application under <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A> was a wholly unsuitable use of
this procedure on the facts of that case. In cases where there may be
alternative discretionary relief available, the court always has the power to

	<A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">Section
42</A> provides a discretionary remedy. If the facts amounting to molestation by
the respondent and the association between respondent and applicant are proved,
the court MAY make a non-molestation order. In <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s42.html">section 42</A>(5):-

of the applicant....."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Although
the court has a wide discretion whether to grant or refuse the relief sought,
it does not have the same flexibility whether to attach a power of arrest if
the facts come within <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/s47.html">section 47</A>(2)(b) where the respondent has used or
threatened violence. This appears to be deliberate policy. The Law Commission
received information, which is set out in the note to para 5.11 of the 1992
Report, about the extent to which the power of arrest was at that time being
attached to injunctions granted under the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial
Proceedings Act 1976. The proportion was under 30%. The Law Commission
considered at para 5.13 that it was wrong in principle that women and children
should have to wait to be injured before the law could offer adequate
protection but that it would also be wrong to provide for an automatic power of
arrest as there might be some cases in which it was inappropriate. The terms of
the Law Commission&#8217;s recommendation have been incorporated into section
47(2).
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">18.
	The
almost mandatory requirement to impose a power of arrest if a non-molestation
order is made raises in this case, (as it may well do in many  similar cases),
a real problem which the judge, in my view, tackled with great common-sense and
good judgment. Once the facts were found to justify a non-molestation order,
since the appellant appears already to have suffered violence, the judge would
almost certainly be satisfied that the appellant would not be adequately
protected without such a power of arrest. Prima facie, on his reading of the
written evidence, a power of arrest would therefore have to be attached to his
order. He would not have the opportunity to exercise his discretion in  the
unusual circumstances of this case to refuse to attach it on the basis that he
was equally satisfied that, if it were attached, its protection would be likely
to be abused by the appellant.  The prospect that the police would have to
respond to a request by the appellant by arresting the first respondent without
any investigation into the truth of the allegations the appellant was making
is, to say the least, unattractive. The judge was entitled to consider that the
power of arrest gave the appellant unacceptable power over the respondents in
the special circumstances of this case, particularly in the light of the
evidence given by the sixth respondent to the effect that he had only narrowly
avoided arrest after an incident involving himself and the appellant at Reading
railway  station the previous week.. In the light of his inability to refuse to
attach a power of arrest to his order, the only alternative would seem to be to
refuse to grant the non-molestation order. This is the sort of case where
cross-undertakings  or cross-injunctions would be the most suitable relief, the
breach of any of which would require a court hearing to determine the facts and
whether either party was in contempt. His refusal to make an order under the
1996 Act would not prevent the judge from accepting cross-undertakings or,
putting on his other county court hat, granting injunctions which did not
include attaching a power of arrest, although this would involve an application
and the cost of instituting separate proceedings. Equally the refusal to grant
relief under the 1996 Act would not inhibit the intervention of the police if
crimes were committed. We know from the history of this family dispute that the
police have already been involved on some occasions and criminal proceedings
have followed.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">19.
	One
plank of Mr Szerard&#180;s argument was that the judge was wrong to make a
decision not to  grant relief without hearing the merits of the application. In
my judgment the way in  which  a judge disposes of the cases before him is very
much  a matter within  the discretion of the judge. Unless he erred in
principle it is not for this Court to intervene. In  the present case, the
evidence upon which the appellant relied included not only  hearsay but, in
some parts, triple hearsay. For the purposes of deciding whether to  grant
relief, it is clear that the judge took the appellant&#8217;s case at its
highest. He said at page 6 of the judgment:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Therefore,
in  the exercise of my discretion, even  accepting as I do that Mr Chechi has
made out a case for the making of an order against Mr Mohammed Bashier and the
continuation of the order against Mr Ghaffar Bashier, and even though on the
face of the papers if this were an appropriate jurisdiction to employ, it would
be a case where such an order would be likely  to be granted, in the exercise
of my  discretion I refuse to make the order."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
 the light of those observations, there would be no  point in the judge hearing
the merits which could not have put the appellant in a stronger position than
the judge was prepared to  accept on the papers before him.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">20.
	I
underline that this is a most unusual case. The appellant himself was, at one
stage, charged with attempted murder of the first respondent, although we
understand that the charges may have been dropped. This appellant may, or may
not, be more vulnerable than the first respondent.  Nothing that I have said
above is intended to diminish the importance and value of the speedy and
simplified procedure provided by the 1996 Act, nor to suggest that those coming
within the definition of &#180;a person associated&#180; ought not, in suitable
cases, to obtain relief under the 1996 Act, whether in the county court or in
a magistrates&#180; court. But the facts of this appeal are at a far remove
from the general run of cases within the ambit of Part IV of the 1996 Act. For
the reasons which I have set out above, the judge came to a most sensible
decision and was justified in refusing the relief sought by the appellant. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">21.
	There
is however one further matter with which we have been asked to  deal. At the
end of his judgment the judge indicated that he would, on application,
discharge the existing orders made against the other respondents, (the
nephews). Mr Szerard informed us that the appellant&#8217;s solicitor was
concerned whether, if violence flared up again, he would be able to rely upon
the orders or whether they were to be treated as non-effective. I have no doubt
that the orders remain effective and enforceable until 13th July 1999 or
otherwise discharged. The police would have had to act on the power of arrest
until the 13th November 1998 when it expired.
