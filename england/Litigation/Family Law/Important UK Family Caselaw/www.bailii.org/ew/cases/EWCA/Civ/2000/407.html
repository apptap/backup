  <P align=right>Friday 20th December 2001.</P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>LORD JUSTICE THORPE: The parties to this appeal 
  married in 1980 and had two daughters, born in 1982 and 1984. Their final 
  matrimonial home was bought in 1995, some four years before their separation 
  in 1999. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>The marriage was dissolved by decree absolute on 16 
  May 2000. On the same day the wife launched her application for ancillary 
  relief. The application was contested, and decided at a hearing before 
  District Judge Chandler on 10 August 2000. He said that the final matrimonial 
  home should be sold after 1 January 2001 and the proceeds used to purchase a 
  three-bedroomed house in Wickford for the occupation of the wife and the two 
  girls. He further said that, on the purchase, the wife should execute a charge 
  in favour of the husband for 45 per cent of its equity, that charge to be 
  redeemed on the first of the following events: (a) death or remarriage of the 
  wife; (b) cohabitation of the wife for a period of more than six months; (c) 
  the wife vacating for more than three months; (d) the wife selling; (e) the 
  youngest child reaching 18 or completing full-time tertiary education, 
  whichever shall be the last to occur; and (f) further order of the court. He 
  finally provided that the husband make periodical payments to the wife during 
  their joint lives, or until remarriage or further order, at the nominal rate 
  of 50p each year. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>Both parties appealed to the circuit judge, and on 
  27 September 2000 His Honour Judge Yelton allowed the appeal and the 
  cross-appeal to the following extent. First, the provision for the redemption 
  of the charge upon the youngest child attaining 18 or completing full-time 
  tertiary education was struck from the order. Secondly, the wife's nominal 
  periodical payments order was struck. There was a further small variation in 
  that, whereas the district judge had said that a United Friendly policy was to 
  be surrendered and the proceeds applied towards the purchase of a new house, 
  the circuit judge said that it should be surrendered forthwith and the 
  proceeds divided equally. The difference between those orders in relation to 
  the United Friendly policy was therefore to ensure that the husband received 
  his share immediately, and not at some uncertain future date after its interim 
  investment in the property to be acquired. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>The husband sought permission to appeal the order of 
  His Honour Judge Yelton. That application succeeded, for reasons which I gave 
  in a short judgment on 1 December 2000. Arrangements have been made to dispose 
  of this short appeal expeditiously, and so it is that it has been brought into 
  the list on this last week of term. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>In fairness to the circuit judge, he did not have at 
  the date of his sitting the guidance of the House of Lords' recent decision in 
  the appeal of <U>White v White</U>. Accordingly, he did not have his attention 
  directed specifically to the importance of equality of treatment. In my 
  opinion, although in his speech Lord Nicholls emphasised that any principle he 
  enunciated was to apply only to those comparatively rare cases where the 
  totality of the assets exceeds the needs of the parties, nevertheless his 
  emphasis upon the need to avoid gender discrimination and the consequential 
  need to treat equality, if not as a starting point, still as a cross check to 
  be applied to any provisional view formed in a court of trial is valid in a 
  more general sense. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>So I ask myself, how did the judge rationalise the 
  deletion of a provision, the likely consequence of which would be to leave the 
  wife with the enjoyment of almost all the capital built up during the marriage 
  for a very long time and possibly for years beyond the husband's decease? All 
  he said in his judgment was: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"To put the wife in a house which she will have to sell or 
    remortgage cannot be right. I see a strong argument for deleting that 
    clause. . . The house is not capital but is somewhere for the wife to live." 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>It seems to me that that is altogether too partisan 
  a perspective. It ignores the husband's reasonable entitlement to deploy 
  capital to house himself at the end of a long marriage during which he has 
  worked hard, mainly in the police service, and has contributed his earnings to 
  the building of family capital. If the judge thought that the deletion was 
  justified by the compensatory deletion of the nominal periodical payments 
  order, I think he was plainly wrong. There are instances in which the 
  interrelationship of capital and income orders justifies the increase of a 
  wife's capital share as compensation for the loss of an income claim. I do not 
  think that this was appropriately one. The husband has a reasonable and 
  discernable need for his share of the family capital at the earliest time that 
  the needs of the children permit. As soon as the wife's responsibilities as 
  the home-maker for the children reach a point of natural termination, at that 
  point clearly the husband is entitled to his capital share. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>Although the husband's current income is not 
  materially greater than the wife's, his earning capacity is potentially far 
  stronger. The husband is currently enmeshed in dispute with the Essex 
  Constabulary, and possibly even with the Home Office, over the circumstances 
  in which his police service was terminated, but it seems to me that that 
  dispute has clouded his judgment, to the extent that he is returning more than 
  half the pension to which he is entitled on the ground that it is a disability 
  provision. The judge found that he had in addition an earning capacity 
  amounting to about £12,000 a year which he could enjoy without diminishing his 
  entitlement to police pension at the rate of about £1,600 each month. The 
  husband says that he has looked in vain for recent employment, but obviously 
  it is not hard to conceive of future circumstances when the wife's claim to 
  periodical payments would become real and not nominal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>So in my opinion the circuit judge had it right 
  first time round. In my opinion, the judge's variations of the district 
  judge's order were founded upon erroneous reasoning. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>We have heard argument as to whether the 
  allocation of only 45 per cent of the equity to the husband's share is 
  supported by principle. Although it is a departure from equality, I think that 
  the district judge was entitled to make that adjustment for the reasons that 
  he gave, namely that the wife was at some long-term disadvantage, since the 
  effect of the decree absolute was to deprive her of an entitlement to widow's 
  pension during any period of survivorship. I also make it clear that the 
  quantification of the husband's charge relates to 45 per cent of such sum as 
  may be traced through from the sale of the final matrimonial home to the 
  purchase of its substitute. Obviously he is not entitled to a charge in 
  respect of any monies invested in the purchase of the substitute house which 
  are derived from other sources. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>I would accordingly restore the order of the 
  district judge in its entirety, save that I would strike paragraph 2. That is 
  no longer apt, since the policy has already been surrendered and the proceeds 
  have already been equally divided between the parties. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>I would only say, finally, that this is yet 
  another instance of unnecessary litigation, and unnecessary expenditure in 
  legal costs, arising from the routes of appeal in ancillary relief in the 
  county court. The vast majority of ancillary relief claims brought upon the 
  breakdown of marriage are brought in the county court. The huge majority of 
  those cases, if they do not settle, are decided by the district judges. The 
  district judges have the expertise. Nonetheless, there is an absolute right of 
  appeal from the district judge to the circuit judge. Despite the introduction 
  of a ticketing system in ancillary relief for circuit judges, this structure 
  means that not infrequently one or other of the parties, dissatisfied with the 
  ruling or the variation introduced by the circuit judge, comes to this court 
  seeking the restoration of the order of the district judge. Of course, since 
  the commencement of the restrictions introduced by section 55 of the Access to 
  Justice Act 1999, there are distinct limits on this court's jurisdiction to 
  entertain such secondary appeals. However, it is high time that decisions were 
  taken on the reform of routes of appeal in family proceedings to correct 
  difficulties which have been clearly demonstrated over the course of at least 
  the last two decades. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>However, that is a general observation, and I 
  revert in this specific case to my conclusion that the appeal must be allowed 
  and the order of the district judge restored, save as to paragraph 2. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>LORD JUSTICE JONATHAN PARKER: I agree. </A>
  <P></P>
  <CENTER>ORDER: Appeal allowed. The order of the district judge to be restored, 
  save as to paragraph 2. Counsel to have liberty to submit an alternative draft 
  of paragraph 3.</CENTER>
  <CENTER>(Order not part of approved judgment)</CENTER></LI></OL>
