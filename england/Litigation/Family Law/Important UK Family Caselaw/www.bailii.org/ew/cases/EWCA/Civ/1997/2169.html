JUSTICE WAITE:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
short but difficult question raised by this appeal is whether the surviving
partner in a stable and permanent homosexual relationship can claim succession
rights under the Rent Acts in respect of premises of which the deceased partner
was a protected tenant.  The facts are not in dispute. Mr John Thompson became
the statutory tenant of a flat No 75 Ravenscourt Road London W6 ("the flat") in
1972. The appellant Mr Fitzpatrick moved in to live with him there in 1976, and
the two of them maintained from then onwards a close, loving and faithful
homosexual relationship.  Early in 1986 Mr Thompson suffered, as a result of a
fall, head injuries which required surgery and then a stroke which left him a
tetraplegic. From the summer of that year Mr Fitzpatrick nursed him at home,
and dedicated himself to providing, with love and devotion, the constant care
which he required.  In 1994 Mr Thompson died.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
landlords are a charity providing families and individuals with accommodation
at affordable rents.  It is common ground that they do not qualify as a Housing
Action Trust within the terms of the Housing Act 1985 (as now amended), and
that they accordingly fall to be treated as private landlords subject to the
Rent Acts.  Mr Fitzpatrick applied to take over the tenancy of the flat (which
comprises four rooms plus kitchen and bathroom) but the landlords, though
willing to re-house him in smaller accommodation in another of their
properties, were not prepared to agree.    
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Mr
Fitzpatrick applied to the West London County Court for a determination that he
was entitled to succeed to the tenancy of the flat.  His application was given
a careful and sympathetic hearing in the Central London Trials Centre by His
Honour Judge Colin Smith QC, who on 19 April 1996 dismissed it with obvious
reluctance, holding that he was constrained by law to treat him as being
outside the statutory definitions of a person entitled to succeed on the death
of a statutory tenant.  From that decision Mr Fitzpatrick now appeals to this
court.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
issues confronting the judge cannot be appreciated without a recital -
unavoidably at some length I am afraid - of the statute and case law which has
developed around this topic.  It will be necessary to include in that survey
the secure tenancy regime for council house tenants as well as the Rent Act
regime in the private sector because the two regimes have similarities in
regard to succession rights which are relevant to the arguments raised on this
appeal.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">THE
LAW
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	A
degree of transmission on death was a feature of the Rent Acts since their
inception in 1920.  At first it was achieved by extending the definition of
"the tenant" to include a widow or qualifying member of his family. That was
replaced by a legislative scheme (maintained to this day) of setting out the
rights of succession in a schedule specifying in the first paragraph the
primary successor and in the second a default category of qualifying successor.
 Originally the primary successor was the deceased tenant's widow.  From 1968
the secondary or default category was defined as a person who was a member of
the original tenant's family residing with him for six months immediately
before his death.  A provision was added in the 1977 Act that if there was more
than one such person the right of succession should be determined in default of
agreement by the court.  The Housing Act 1980 substituted "surviving spouse"
for "widow" in the primary class, which was thus extended to widowers.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	When
security of tenure was afforded to council tenants by the Housing Act 1980, a
scheme was set up which bore similarities to the Rent Act regime.  But there
were differences.  S 30 (now S 87 of the Housing Act 1985) provided a similarly
expressed primary right of succession for the deceased tenant's spouse and
secondary right for "another member of the tenant's family" living with him for
twelve months before his death.  In this instance, however, the term "family"
was specifically defined.  S 50 (now S 113 of the 1985 Act) provided that:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
person is a member of another's family .....if 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		(a)	he
is the spouse of that person, or he and that person live together as husband
and wife, or
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		(b)	he
is that person's parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, sister,
uncle, aunt, nephew or niece".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">A
further sub-section applied the categories in (b) to cases where the relevant
relationship was by marriage, step relationship, or half blood.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	It
is to be noted that although advantage was taken by Parliament when enacting
the Housing Act 1980 of the opportunity to amend the Rent Acts by substituting
spouse for widow in the primary class of successor, and thus harmonise the two
succession systems in that respect, it was not apparently thought necessary or
desirable to introduce into the Rent Act regime two significant features of the
secure tenancy regime, namely the specific definition of "family" and the
specific enlargement of the definition of "spouse" to include persons "living
together as husband and wife".  Those were left to be dealt with in the Rent
Act regime, as they had been previously, by judicial interpretation.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	It
will be convenient at this point to pause in the narrative of statutory
development and turn to the authorities embodying that interpretation.  Their
full significance cannot be appreciated without some reference to the social
changes that were occurring during the period with which they were concerned -
that is to say the mid-60s to the mid-80s - regarding the incidence of, and
social attitudes towards, cohabitation outside marriage in heterosexual, and
also in gay and lesbian, relationships.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Unmarried
cohabitation between heterosexuals developed strikingly in scale to the point
that today (according to figures helpfully supplied by the Family Policies
Study Centre) 25% of all women aged between 18 and 49 are unmarried
cohabitants, and in the age group most likely to cohabit (women in their late
20s and men in their late 30s) over one third of the population now cohabits.
As it became more common, cohabitation lost the secretiveness with which it had
sometimes been concealed by those who felt the need to give the appearances of
marriage (through change of surname by deed poll for example) to their
relationship.  As it became more open, so attitudes toward it became less
judgmental.  That included the attitude of the courts, where notwithstanding
that the encouragement of marriage as an institution remains a well established
head of public policy, the respect due to the sincerity of commitment involved
in many such relationships is reflected in judicial terminology - terms like
"partner" now being more generally used than the once preferred references to
"common law spouse", "mistress" or even (as will shortly be illustrated)
"living in sin."  A similar respect is reflected in The Law Commission's
current consideration of steps to devise for unmarried partners procedures to
ease the potential for financial dispute when such relationships break down. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In
the same way, though on a lesser scale, the increasing recognition by society
of the respect due to those who share orientation towards their own sex has led
to a greater openness in, and the removal of public censoriousness towards, gay
and lesbian cohabitation.  One indicator of this has been the willingness of
the court, in appropriate circumstances, to regard a partner in a gay or
lesbian relationship as a suitable person to adopt a child - see (in Scotland)
the Opinion of the Lord President in The Petition of AMT (26 July 1996) and the
judgment of Singer J in Re W (minor) The Times 21 May 1997.  The degree of
interdependence, marital in character, involved in gay or lesbian relationships
has also been acknowledged in the field of equity - see Barclays Bank v O'Brien
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/6.html">1994 AC 180</a> per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at page 198 D. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Turning
(against that changing social background) to the case law, I begin with Brock v
Wollams [1949] 2 KB 388.  It concerned a statutory tenant survived by a child
who had been informally, though not legally, adopted.  The child was held by
this court to have been included within the definition of the tenant's family
for Rent Act purposes.  Cohen LJ (at p 395) expressed it in these terms:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
question the county court judge should have asked himself was this: Would an
ordinary man, addressing his mind to the question whether [the daughter] was a
member of the family or not, have answered "yes" or "no"?  To that question I
think there is only one possible answer, and that is "yes"."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Gammans
v Ekins [1950] 2 KB 328 concerned a heterosexual relationship between an
unmarried couple who had adopted all the appearances of marriage and were
thought of in their neighbourhood as being man and wife.  The Court of Appeal
rejected the claim of the survivor to be treated as a member of the deceased
tenant's "family".  Asquith LJ held that the tie of marriage was essential to
family membership. commenting that if (as to which there had been no finding
below) the relationship was a sexual one it would be anomalous to allow the
status of irremovability under the Rent Acts to be acquired "by living or
having lived in sin", he added:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"To
say of two people masquerading as these two were, as husband and wife (there
being no children to complicate the picture) that they were members of the same
family, seems to be an abuse of the English language..."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In
Ross v Collins [1964] 1 WLR 425 a sub-tenant of one room forming part of a
protected tenancy who became the devoted carer of the deceased tenant in old
age and illness failed to secure recognition by the court of "family
membership."  Russell LJ said:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Granted
that "family" is not limited to cases of a strict legal familial nexus, I
cannot agree that it extends to a case such as this.  It still requires, it
seems to me, at least a broadly recognisable de facto familial nexus.  This may
be capable of being found and recognised as such by the ordinary man - where
the link would be strictly familial had there been a marriage, or where the
link is through adoption of a minor, de jure or de facto, or where the link is
"step-" or where the link is "in-law" or by marriage. But two strangers cannot,
it seems to me, ever establish artificially for the purposes of this section a
familial nexus by acting as brothers or as sisters, even if they call each
other such and consider their relationship to be tantamount to that. nor, in my
view, can an adult man and woman who establish a platonic relationship
establish a familial nexus by acting as a devoted brother and sister or father
and daughter would act, even if they address each other as such and even if
they refer to each other as such and regard their relationship as tantamount to
such. Nor, in my view, would they indeed be recognised as familial links by the
ordinary man."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	A
heterosexual unmarried relationship of long standing required consideration by
this court in Dyson Holdings v Fox [1976] 1 QB 503.  A spinster lived with the
statutory tenant as his wife for 21 years before his death.  She took his name,
and in every respect they were man and wife save that they had not gone through
the marriage ceremony.  The court was sympathetic to her claim to be regarded
as part of the deceased tenant's family, but the decision in Gammans v Ekins
(supra) stood in the way.  Lord Denning MR was in favour of dealing with it
head-on and holding that it could not - or in the light of later authority
could no longer - be supported. The preference of the majority of the court was
to distinguish it by treating it as correct according to the social conditions
of its time, but holding that in current social conditions "family" had
acquired a wider connotation.  James LJ said:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Between
1950 and 1975 there have been many changes in the law effected by statute and
decisions of the courts. Many changes have their foundation in the changed
needs and views of society.  Such changes have occurred in the field of family
law and equitable interests in property.  The popular meaning given to the word
"family" is not fixed once and for all time.  I have no doubt that with the
passage of years it has changed."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">There
are observations to like effect in the judgment of Bridge LJ.   It is
important, however, to note of that case that on the actual ratio of the
decision upon its facts (as opposed to the grounds for distinguishing earlier
authority) there was unanimity between the judges. That ratio was expressed by
Lord Denning MR in this sentence (p 509):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"....
we should hold that a couple who live together as man and wife for 20 years are
members of the same family, whether they have children or not."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Although
the rationale of Dyson was doubted by another division of this court in Helby v
Rafferty [1979] 1 WLR 13, it was held to be binding.  On the particular facts
of that case (an unmarried couple who made no attempt at pretence of marriage,
because the woman wanted to retain her independence, and who even attempted at
times to conceal the depth of their attachment) it was held that the trial
judge had been justified in declining to regard the couple as a "family".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	When
the unusual case of a widow of 75 sharing her protected flat with a young man
of 25 with whom she maintained a close but platonic friendship came before the
House of Lords in Carega Properties v Sharratt [1979] 1 WLR 928, the facts were
regarded as too exceptional to justify treating the case as an opportunity for
a consideration by the House of the rightness of the decision in Dyson (supra).
The judge had answered "the Cohen question" (as it had by then come to be
called) with a "yes", but the court of appeal answered it with a "no," and the
House of Lords agreed.  The points of principle that emerge from the case are
Viscount Dilhorne's statement (p 932) that the meaning to be given to the
phrase "a member of the original tenant's family" is a question of law, that
"family" is a word whose content so varies with its context that it is for the
judge to construe the statute and for him to state his conclusion as to the
meaning (in its ordinary natural sense) of the word in the particular context,
and that "family" must be read as meaning something more than "household".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In
Watson v Lucas [1980] 1 WLR 1494 this court was concerned with a heterosexual
relationship between the tenant and a married man who never divorced his wife,
both parties continuing to use their true names and making no attempt to
pretend married status.  Dyson, though once more criticised, was again held to
be binding, and the majority (Oliver LJ dissenting) held that the trial judge
had been wrong to regard the man's continuing married status and the use by
both parties of their original surnames as negativing the "family" status of
their relationship.  Stephenson LJ described the ratio of Dyson in these terms
(p 1498):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"I
understand the ratio of the majority decision as holding that a union between a
man and a woman, which in all the circumstances, known and unknown to the
ordinary man, looks permanent and stable to him, creates a family unit and both
parties are members of it, whether or not it consists of more than those two."  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">He
later added (p 1501):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
ordinary man has to consider whether a man or a woman is a member of a family
in the light of the facts, and whatever may have been held before [Dyson] I do
not think a judge, putting himself in the place of the ordinary man, can
consider an association which has every outward appearance of marriage, except
the false pretence of being married, as not constituting a family.....The time
has gone by when the courts can hold such a union not to be "familial" simply
because the parties to it do not pretend to be married in due form of law."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Sir
David Cairns held that the case could not sensibly be differentiated from
Dyson, and continued (p 1507):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"It
is the relations between the man and the woman that are relevant rather than
the appearance that they present to the public." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Sefton
Holdings v Cairns [1987] 20 HLR 124 concerned a woman statutory tenant whose
parents had taken in a 23 year old orphan girl (the claimant) during the last
war and ever thereafter treated her as a daughter.  When the parents died the
tenant and the claimant remained in the house, where they regarded each other
as sisters.  After the death of the tenant many years later, the claimant
obtained a holding from the judge that she was a member of the tenant's family.
That was reversed on appeal. The case was held to be analogous to Ross v
Collins (supra) from which the passage already quoted in the judgment of
Russell LJ was cited with approval by Lloyd LJ, who said that it covered the
facts of that case.  He later added this (p 127):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	".....there
is a distinction between 
<U>being</U>
a member of the family and living 
<U>as</U>
a member of the family.  There is no doubt that the defendant lived as a member
of the family, and that may be why the judge decided this case in her favour.
But the question we have to ask ourselves is not whether she lived as a member
of the family, but whether she was a member of the family. I am clear that she
was not, and that the man in the street would take the same view."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	That
completes the authorities decided down to 1987 in the Rent Act jurisdiction.
It will have been noted that they all concern claims to familial status for
relationships that were either platonic or heterosexual.  There is no decision,
in that area of the law, as to the right of a partner in a gay or lesbian
relationship to be accorded the status of member of the other partner's
"family" for succession purposes under the Rent Acts. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Such
a question did, however arise during that period in regard to the right of such
a partner to succeed to a secure tenancy of a local authority letting.  The
case was Harrogate Borough Council v Simpson [1984] 17 HLR 205.  The claimant
(defending proceedings for possession by the local authority) had lived with
the deceased secure tenant in a lesbian relationship for some years and was so
living at the date of her death.  It will be remembered that in the secure
tenancy regime membership of the "family" is specifically defined.  It was
accepted that the claimant could not bring herself within any other head of
that definition and that she could succeed (if at all) only under the head
which reads (Housing Act 1980 S 50 (3)):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
person is a member of another's family...if they live together as husband and
wife".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Watkins
LJ recited the argument of the claimant's counsel as follows:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Mr.
Allan suggests that the manifestations of the living together of husband and
wife following a marriage ceremony are easily recognisable and are for the most
part similar to a state where two women live together in a lesbian
relationship.  He says that in both there may be mutual love, monogamy, some
degree of public acknowledgement of their condition of living, faithfulness by
one to the other, a permanence of relationship, sexual relations of some kind,
a shared surname, a joint household and, in the case of man and woman, of
course, children.  Save for the bearing of children, he maintains that all or
nearly all of those manifestations can appear from the living together of two
women.  So, if the appearance of things is the test, there is no earthly reason
why the Act is not complied with when two women live together in the state in
which the late Mrs. Rodrigo and the defendant were living.  They should be held
to be living as husband and wife.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	We
are told that, not only did they so regard and describe themselves, but they
behaved in some ways (outwardly at any rate) as though one was the husband and
the other was the wife.  Mrs. Rodrigo was the masculine partner apparently and
wore men's clothing, and the defendant was the female counterpart.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Mr.
Allan places reliance upon the word "as" which is contained in the final words
of section 50(3). By the appearance of that word in its context it is to be
understood that Parliament was indicating, not only that the provisions were
intended to apply to persons who were married in the formal sense, but also to
unions which gave the appearance of two people living together in a kind of
matrimonial state.  Much has happened, he further maintains, over the last
decade or more to change people's opinions about what before that time were
considered to be repugnant sexual relationships.  Nowadays nobody blanches at
the fact that two women who are lesbians live together, or two men who are
homosexuals.  It is not a crime for men in most circumstances to behave in that
way, and, so far as lesbians are concerned, a crime in no circumstance.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">He
then referred to Dyson, from which he quoted, and stated his conclusion in
these terms: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Mrs
Davies, who appears for the plaintiffs, contends that, if Parliament had wished
homosexual relationships to be brought into the realm of the lawfully
recognised state of a living together of man and wife for the purpose of the
relevant legislation, it would plainly have so stated in that legislation and
it has not done so. I am bound to say that I entirely agree with that. I am
also firmly of the view that it would be surprising in the extreme to learn
that public opinion is such today that it would recognise a homosexual union as
being akin to a state of living as husband and wife.  The ordinary man and
woman, neither in 1975 [a reference to the date of Dyson] nor in 1984, would in
my opinion think even remotely of there being a true resemblance between those
two very different states of affairs."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Ewbank
J (the other member of the court) said:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"I
agree that the expression 'living together as husband and wife'.....is not apt
to include a homosexual relationship.  The essential characteristic of living
together as husband and wife, in my judgment, is that there should be a man and
a woman...." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
must now return to the narrative of statutory development.  The <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act</A></A>
<A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">1988</A></A> introduced into the first schedule to the Rent Act 1977 a provision that:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"a
person who was living with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband
shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">To
that there was joined a provision (catering apparently for triangular
relationships) that if there should be more than one person claiming "spouse
status" by virtue of that insertion, such one of them as should be selected by
agreement or by the court in default of agreement should constitute the
surviving "spouse" for that purpose.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Another
alteration was a change in the nature of the tenancy taken by a member of the
deceased tenant's family (as opposed to a spouse in the true or extended
sense).  This was to be an assured tenancy in place of a statutory tenancy.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	No
other relevant change was made to the Schedule. Specifically (and, it is
claimed, significantly) no attempt was made to alter the generality of the
reference to the deceased tenant's "family" by importing into it a specific
definition on the lines already provided in the Housing Acts for the secure
tenancy succession regime. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	As
a result of these developments the First Schedule to the Rent Act 1977 now
reads (so far as relevant):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	1.	Paragraph
2...below shall have effect, subject to section 2 (3) of this Act, for the
purpose of determining who is the statutory tenant of a dwelling house by
succession after the death of the person (in this Part of this Schedule
referred to as "the original tenant") who, immediately before his death, was a
protected tenant of the dwelling-house or the statutory tenant of it by virtue
of his previous protected tenancy.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	2
(1)
	The
surviving spouse (if any) of the original tenant, if residing in the
dwelling-house immediately before the death of the original tenant, shall after
the death be the statutory tenant if and so long as he or she occupies the
dwelling-house as his or her residence. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(2)	For
the purposes of this paragraph, a person who was living with the original
tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be treated as the spouse of the
original tenant.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(3)	If,
immediately after the death of the original tenant, there is, by virtue of
sub-paragraph (2) above, more than one person who fulfils the conditions in
sub-paragraph (1) above, such one of them as may be decided by agreement or, in
default of agreement, by the county court shall be treated as the surviving
spouse for the purposes of this paragraph.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	3.

	Where
paragraph 2 above does not apply, but a person who was a member of the original

that person or if there is more than one such person such one of them as may be
decided by agreement, or in default of agreement by the county court, shall be
entitled to an assured tenancy of the dwelling-house by succession.

OF THE STATUTE AND CASE LAW
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">A.	<U>The
Secure Tenancy Regime
</U><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Succession
to a secure tenancy can only be obtained by a person who in relation to the
deceased tenant was:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(a)	a
spouse
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(b)	someone
living with him or her as husband and wife
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(c)	a
member of his or her family who resided with the tenant for 12 months before
the date of death - the term "family" being specifically defined to include
only certain relatives by blood or marriage or step-connection.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	A
lesbian or gay partner cannot qualify under (a) or (c) because of the absence
of the marriage tie in the one case and the required kinship in the other.  A
heterosexual partner can qualify under (b) but a gay or lesbian partner cannot
do so because of the ruling in Harrogate. To that extent the secure tenancy
regime discriminates against gay and lesbian partners in favour of heterosexual
partners of deceased tenants by conferring succession rights on the latter but
not the former.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">B.	<U>The
Rent Acts Regime
</U><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Succession
to a statutory or protected tenancy can only be obtained by a person who was in
relation to the deceased tenant:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(a)	a
spouse
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(b)	someone
living with him or her as wife or husband
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(c)	a
member of his or her family residing with him or her in the dwelling-house at
the time of and for a period of two years before the death.  "Member of the
family" is in this instance undefined.  Case law has held it to be a term of
wide import capable of being interpreted flexibly by the courts according to
the social perceptions of the time (Dyson) as reflected through the eyes of the
ordinary man or woman (Brock v Wollams, Carega v Sharratt and Sefton Holdings v
Cairns) but the instances in which, following that interpretation, it has been
applied outside the strict family ties of marriage or kinship are limited to a
child informally adopted (Brock v Wollams) and persons of opposite sex living
together as man and wife (Dyson and Watson v Lucas). There has (until this
present case) been no decision on the question whether a surviving lesbian or
gay partner of a deceased statutory tenant qualifies for the status of "member
of the family".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">OVERSEAS
AUTHORITY
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
New York City Rent and Eviction Regulations contain a provision that upon the
death of a rent-control tenant the landlord may not dispossess:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"either
the surviving spouse of the deceased or some other member of the deceased'
tenant's family who has been living with the tenant".
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In
Braschi v Stahl Associates Co [1989] NYS 2nd 784 (Ct App 1989) the New York
Supreme Court held that a surviving male partner in a gay relationship with the
deceased tenant was eligible to claim protection under the Regulations.  The
Appellate Division reversed the decision, holding that protection applied only
to "family members within traditional, legally recognised familial
relationships".  The Court of Appeals of New York allowed an appeal from that
holding, declaring, by a majority of 4 to 2, that "the Legislature intended to
extend protection to those who reside in households having all the normal
familial characteristics.  The [appellant] should therefore be allowed the
opportunity to prove that he and [the deceased tenant] had such a household."
In remitting the case for a determination on that issue, the court (per Justice
Titone) said (p 790):
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	".....it
is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by the dedication, caring and
self-sacrifice of the parties which should in the final analysis control.
Appellant's situation provides an example of how the rule should be applied."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">THE
APPROACH OF THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	It
was common ground that the Judge was required, when construing the phrase "a
member of the original tenant's family", to apply the general interpretive
principle of Dyson - i.e. to construe the term "family" in its popular modern
meaning, taking into account changed social attitudes and the changed needs and
views of society.  He held that in adopting that approach he was bound to look
for a familial link, following the approach of Russell LJ in Ross v Collins
which he held to be of general application and not limited to the context of a
non-sexual relationship.  Applying the actual ratio of Dyson (as confirmed in
Watson v Lucas) he held that the relevant familial link for this purpose was
that between husband and wife - which means (when applied to the context of an
unmarried relationship) that the relationship must give to the ordinary man the
appearance of a couple living as man and wife.  After saying that in this
respect the Braschi decision appeared to show a difference of approach between
the law of New York and that of England, he stated his conclusion in these terms:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"I
fully accept that a cohabiting relationship between members of the same sex of
a permanent and stable kind would properly be regarded nowadays, whether in
1996 or 1994, by the man in the street as just as lasting and socially valuable
a relationship as that between husband and wife. But, in my judgment, for the
reasons I have attempted to give, this does not entitle me, even in construing
the word "family" in a popular sense as required by Dyson, to find that such a
relationship falls within such definition. In my judgment, such a decision
falls to be made by Parliament and not by the courts. It will be for others to
decide whether Parliament should look at this question, but perhaps, in the
light of the Court of Appeal's observations in ex parte Lustig-Prean, it might
be appropriate for it to do so."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">THE
ARGUMENT IN THIS APPEAL
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	This
case has been ably argued, and counsel have done full justice to the powerful
considerations on either side. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">A.
 
	<U>Evidence
of social attitudes
</U><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	At
the hearing before the judge, Mr Luba, counsel for Mr Fitzpatrick, sought leave
to introduce in evidence a substantial body of material in the form of reports
and informed comment on recent developments in the attitude of society towards
lesbian and gay relationships.  The judge ruled it inadmissible, holding that
the question was one of law involving statutory interpretation on which it
would be impermissible to receive extraneous evidence of social perception.  He
was very far, however, from saying that judicial notice could not be taken of
changing social attitudes.  On the contrary he referred to, and quoted from,
the judgments of Sir Thomas Bingham MR and Henry LJ in the recent case on
employment of homosexuals in the armed services (R v Ministry of Defence ex
parte Lustig-Prean [1995] ALR 29) as an example of judicial expression of the
major changes in public attitudes towards homosexuality that have taken place
in our generation.  Mr Luba submits that the judge was wrong to exclude such
evidence.  Included within it was the evidence of an expert, Dr Dawn Sharp,
charting in two reports the changes in public perceptions of homosexuality and
concluding that:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"...public
opinion is increasingly favourable towards homosexuality and equal rights for
homosexual people"
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Reference
to such material might, for instance, have been of the greatest value, so Mr
Luba submits, in enabling the judge to determine whether or not changes in
public perception had 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">taken
place within what at first sight appears to be the very short period between
the decision in Harrogate (1985) and today, and if so whether such changes
would justify attributing today to such phrases as "living as man and wife" and
"member of the family" a wider connotation than would have been appropriate
twelve years ago. He cites, in support of that, Lord Hope in Re AMT (supra): 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Where
public policy stands on homosexuality is a matter for the Court to determine
from the material before it and then to apply, so far as relevant, to the facts
of the case.  So the judge may examine such material as the intendment of the
Act and decisions and dicta in other cases in order to discover objectively
what, if anything, public policy has to say on the issue. In that exercise he
is performing a judicial function on behalf of the Court, What he must not do
is permit his own personal views, or his own private beliefs, to affect his
judgment."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Those
words, with which I would respectfully agree, appear to indorse, rather than to
deprecate, the decision of the judge in the instant case to rely exclusively on
the material already before him, and his own judicial knowledge of changing
social attitudes towards homosexuality, without taking account of extraneous
evidence as to the views of individual bodies or persons. The judge clearly did
not need to be informed as to the marked changes that have taken place in
social acceptance of homosexuality, as the passage which I have already cited
from his judgment makes plain. I would therefore reject this ground of appeal.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">B.	<U>"Living
with the original tenant as his or her wife or
</U>
<U>husband"</U>.<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Mr
Luba reserves the right, should this case go further, to contend that the
Harrogate case was wrongly decided.  He accepts however that it represents a
decision in a closely similar context on virtually identical wording.  Subject
to one or two minor points of possible distinction which he advanced with more
diffidence than enthusiasm, he acknowledged that the decision is not only
binding on this court but so closely analogous as to be virtually
indistinguishable.  In the light of that acknowledgment, which in my view was
properly given, it is unnecessary to say more about this possible head of
claim.  The court is in my view bound, in the present state of the law, to
treat that phrase, when used in the Rent Act as well as in the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act</A></A>, as
applying to a heterosexual relationship only.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">C.	<U>"Member
of the original tenant's family"
</U>.<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
applicability of this phrase has provided the central issue in the appeal.  Can
a sexual partner of the same sex be described as a member of his or her family?
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Mr
Chapman for the landlord charity accepts, as he did before the judge, the
interpretative principle of Dyson, namely that the court is bound to give to
the term "member of the family" whatever connotation it demands in current
popular thought and speech.  He submits however that the judge was right to
regard himself as constrained by authority to hold that when a sexual
relationship between strangers in blood is relied on as constituting a family
relationship, the attachment must bear the hall-mark of the familial nexus
represented either by marriage or by unmarried cohabitation of the kind that
occurs between husband and wife.  For that he relies on the ratio of the
decisions in Dyson and Watson v Lucas and the attributes of a familial
relationship approved in Ross v Collins.  The requirement that the partners
should be living as husband and wife necessarily imports a male and female
relationship and precludes its application to relationships between persons of
the same sex.  Mr Chapman also submitted that the judge's decision has the
advantage of harmonising the two regimes of statutory and secure tenancies.  He
reminded us, finally, that Rent Act legislation, though it fulfils a public
interest in the social control of land for the benefit of those least able to
afford accommodation, is nevertheless by its nature expropriatary in its
interference with rights of ownership of land, and should therefore, he
submitted, be construed restrictively by adopting an interpretation of "family
membership" which limits, rather than enlarges, the range of potential
successor to a statutory tenant. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Mr
Luba urges that, on the contrary, Parliament must be deemed to have known what
it was about when the decision was taken, at the time of the 1988 amendments to
the First schedule, to leave the expression "member of ...the family" to be
interpreted broadly, in the sense approved in Dyson - a decision which formed
an important part of the case law in operation when those changes were made.
Such an interpretation, in the light of modern social attitudes and conditions,
can lead, he submits, to only one result.  If unmarried heterosexual partners
in a permanent relationship are capable of being held (as they were in Dyson
and Watson v Lucas) to be members of the former tenant's family, what reason
can there be in logic or humanity for declining to accord the same status to a
partner in a lesbian or gay relationship?
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">CONCLUSION<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	If
endurance, stability, interdependence and devotion were the sole hall-marks of
family membership, there could be no doubt about this case at all.  Mr
Fitzpatrick and Mr Thompson lived together for a longer period than many
marriages endure these days.  They were devoted and faithful, giving each other
mutual help and support in a life which shared many of the highest qualities to
be found in heterosexual attachments, married or unmarried. To adopt an
interpretation of the statute that allowed all sexual partners, whether of the
same or opposite sex, to enjoy the privilege of succession to tenancies
protected by the Rent Acts would, moreover, be consistent not only with social
justice but also with the respect accorded by modern society to those of the
same sex who undertake a permanent commitment to a shared life.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
survey which I have undertaken in this judgment shows, however, that the law in
England regarding succession to statutory tenancies is firmly rooted in the
concept of the family as an entity bound together by ties of kinship (including
adoptive status) or marriage. The only relaxation, first by court decision and
then by statute, has been a willingness to treat heterosexual cohabitants as if
they were husband and wife. That was a restrictive extension, offensive to
social justice and tolerance because it excludes lesbians and gays. It is out
of tune with modern acceptance of the need to avoid any discrimination on the
ground of sexual orientation. In that respect I wholly agree with the comments
of Lord Justice Ward. The question is: how is it to be put right?
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Discrimination
is not, unfortunately, the only arbitrary feature in this area of the law.
Endemic within its system is a high risk of harsh or anomalous results -
excluding from rights of succession many deserving instances of common
households in which the survivor would have a strong moral case to succeed to
the tenancy. Friends of long standing (widowers or spinsters for example) who
share accommodation in old age without any sexual element in their
relationship, but who often give and receive much the same kind of devoted care
as we have admired in this case, are (and always have been) excluded.  If
succession rights are to be extended to couples of the same sex in a sexually
based relationship, would it be right to continue to exclude friends?  If
friends are to be included, how is the stability and permanence of their
household to be defined? 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	These
questions have to be judged in the light of a further policy consideration -
fairness to home owners.  Every enlargement of the class of potential
successors to rent controlled tenancies involves a deeper invasion of rights of
house-owners to possession of their own property.  That there is a need to
reconcile these competing social priorities is something on which it would be
easy to find a broad consensus. The difficulty arises when it comes to finding
ways and means. At that point opinions are bound to vary, and a political
judgment may in the end become necessary.  That is what makes the process of
reconciliation a task better suited to the legislative function of Parliament
than to the interpretative role of the courts.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
law of succession to Rent Act protected tenancies is, in short, arbitrary and
discriminatory.  No one today would attempt to defend the favour it accords,
outside the marriage tie, to heterosexual relationships over same-sex
households.  Few would support the potential for unfairness involved in a law
which gives automatic succession rights to wives (however faithless) and
children (however feckless) and at the same time denies any hope of succession
to friends, however devoted their loyalty to the joint household. The judge was
nevertheless right, in my view, to resist the temptation to change a bad law by
giving it a new linguistic twist.  He correctly acknowledged that such changes
could only be made by Parliament.
	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	They
are changes which will certainly need to be made, if Parliament is to fulfil
its function of reflecting the spirit of our times - in particular the spirit
which recognises the value of all abiding relationships, the heterosexual, the
lesbian, the gay - or even those which are not sexually based at all. As the
law now stands, however, I feel bound, notwithstanding the respect and sympathy
to which Mr Fitzpatrick is entitled, to dismiss the appeal.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">LORD

<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
case involves the construction of Schedule 1 of the Rent Act 1977 as amended by
Section 76 of the Housing Act 1980 and Schedule 4 of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A></A>.  The
provisions of Schedule 1 are rules by which statutory tenants by succession are

of a person who immediately before his death was either a protected tenant of
the dwelling house or the statutory tenant of it.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
rules are contained in paragraphs 2 and 3(1) of Schedule 1.  Those paragraphs
have been amended twice and now read:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"2.	The

beginning on the date on which Part 1 of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A></A> came into force.

Holdings -v- Fox
</I>
[1976] 1 QB 503 CA that the meaning of words such as &#8220;family&#8221; in
this schedule of <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">this Act</A></A> change as the ordinary and popular meaning of such
words change, that is to say as the popular use made of such words change.
James LJ at page 511D said:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"The
popular meaning given to the word &#8220;family&#8221; is not fixed once and
for all time.  I have no doubt that with the passage of years it has changed.
The cases reveal that it is not restricted to blood relationships and those
created by the marriage ceremony.  It can include de facto as well as de jure
relationships.  The popular meaning of &#8220;family&#8221; in 1975 would,
according to the answer of the ordinary man, include the defendant as a member
of Mr Wright&#8217;s family.  This is not to say that every mistress should be
so regarded.  Relationships of a casual or intermittent character and those
bearing indications of impermanence would not come within the popular concept
of a family unit."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
would suggest that this statement is in conflict with the role of the judge in
construing this statute as seen by Viscount Dilhorne in the passage from his
speech cited above.  The decision in 
<I>Dyson
Holdings Ltd -v- Fox
</I>
was considered by Lord Diplock to pose &#8220;a difficult question&#8221; which
was best left for consideration in a future case.  The approach of this court
to interpreting this legislation has been followed on many occasions in this
court, albeit that some members of the court have followed it reluctantly
expressing grave doubts as to the wisdom of such an approach.  On the one hand
such an approach can be said to prolong the life and usefulness of a statutory
provision.  On the other hand, it must inevitably increase the uncertainties
which the imprecision of our language, even in the hands of skilled
parliamentary draughtsmen, create and cause the judiciary to run the risk of
being accused of usurping the legislative function.  I suspect that changes in
the ordinary and natural meaning of words which increase the scope of
protection to those occupying premises with a tenant at the time of the
tenant&#8217;s death would be acceptable, whereas changes in the ordinary and
natural meaning of words which restricted the scope of such protection would
not.  The technique of the common law has been to adapt and advance the law
progressively whilst being able to claim that the decision was an application
of existing principles already disclosed in decided cases.  This approach was
modified in the 1970&#8217;s when the House of Lords determined that it might
and would depart from a previous decision when it appeared right to do so
because a too rigid a adherence to precedent might lead to injustice or unduly
restrict the proper development of the law.  The approach that is normally
followed in the House of Lords and has to be followed in this court and other
courts is one which ensures that the development of the law is gradual and
progressive and to a degree predictable; attributes which may be thought to be
beneficial to the administration of justice.  The principle stated in 
<I>Dyson&#8217;s
case
</I>
allows the judge  who can detect a change in the ordinary popular meaning of a
word used in a statute to escape from the doctrine of precedent.  The principle
makes it difficult logically to refuse an application by a party to be
permitted to call evidence as to changes in the ordinary popular meaning of
words; an application which all those members of this court were agreed was
rightly refused by the judge in this case.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Having
expressed my reservations with the decision in 
<I>Dyson
Holdings -v- Fox
</I>,
I must, as have others in this court, follow it.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
trial judge&#8217;s finding that the appellant was not the &#8220;spouse&#8221;
of the deceased is not contested in this appeal.  It is accepted that the
appellant was not the deceased&#8217;s &#8220;spouse&#8221;; that a spouse is a
man who is married to a woman or a woman who is married to a man.  Mr Luba
relied on the deeming provision in paragraph 2(2) of the 1st Schedule.  The
appellant was, he submitted, a person who was living with the original tenant
as his or her wife or husband.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
purpose of the sub-paragraph is, in my view, clear.  It is to enable those who
live together as if they are husband and wife but who are not legally married
to have the same protection as a surviving spouse would have.  The amendment
reflected the growing numbers of men and women who choose to co-habit without
being married.  The amendment was necessary, despite the decision in 
<I>Dyson
Holdings Ltd -v- Fox
</I>
because Parliament knew that the word &#8220;spouse&#8221; having as it does a
precise meaning, would not be interpreted by the courts to cover men and women
who were unmarried and cohabiting.  The use of the words &#8220;wife&#8221; and
&#8220;husband&#8221; makes clear, in my judgment, Parliament&#8217;s intention
that the surviving spouse who is to succeed to the statutory tenancy on the
death of the original tenant is to be either the female partner of a male
original tenant or the male partner of a female original tenant.  The use of
the word &#8220;as&#8221; accommodated the fact that the survivor would not be
the wife or husband of the deceased original tenant.  That phrase is not wide
enough, in my view in its ordinary and natural meaning to enable same sex
partners to be treated as spouses.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In
my judgment the words that Parliament chose to use when widening the scope of
paragraph 2 did not significantly alter the meaning of the word
&#8220;spouse&#8221;.   Parliament did not substitute another word for the word
&#8220;spouse&#8221; as Parliament would have done had Parliament intended to
include in the scope of paragraph 2 same sex partners.  Thus, in my judgment,
the appellant cannot become the statutory tenant of this dwelling in succession
to the late Mr Thompson.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Is
the appellant entitled to an assured tenancy of the dwelling house by
succession as a member of the original tenant&#8217;s family who was residing
with him in the dwelling house at the time and for a period of two years
immediately before the original tenant&#8217;s death under paragraph 3(1) of
the Schedule?  Mr Luba has argued very persuasively that the appellant is so
entitled.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Here
the terms of paragraph 6 of the Schedule are of some assistance.  That
paragraph suggests that a person can cease to be a member of the original
tenant&#8217;s family, that is to say a person can have been a member of that
family but have ceased to be a member in the period immediately before the
death of the tenant.  The wording would also suggest that a person can become a
member of the original tenant&#8217;s family during his or her lifetime.  That
must be correct if the paragraph is to cover those who become married to or
adopted by the original tenant.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
family envisaged in Schedule 1 is a group that a person can join or a person
can leave.  If you can leave the family, the family cannot be defined
exclusively by ties of consanguinity.  On the other hand, the requirement that
the member of the family, in order to achieve the protection given either by
paragraph 3 or paragraph 6 shall have resided with the tenant in the dwelling
house for a period of time immediately before the tenant&#8217;s death
demonstrates that the family is not to be defined by physical proximity, still
less by the term &#8220;household&#8221;.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
conclusion that I have reached on this ground of this appeal is the same as
that reached by my Lord Lord Justice Waite, namely that:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"The
concept of the family is an entity bound together by ties of kinship including
adoptive status or marriage&#8221;."
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In

[1964] 1 WLR 425 Russell LJ said at page 432:
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"Granted
that &#8220;family&#8221; is not limited to cases of a strict legal familial
nexus, I cannot agree that it extends to a case such as this.  It still
requires, it seems to me, at least a broadly recognisable de facto familial
nexus.  This may be capable of being found and recognised as such by the
ordinary man - where the link would be strictly familial had there been a
marriage, or where the link is through adoption of a minor, de jure or de
facto, or where the link is &#8220;step-&#8221;, or where the link is
&#8220;in-law&#8221; or by marriage.  But two strangers cannot, it seems to me,
ever establish artificially for the purposes of this section a familial nexus
by acting as brothers or as sisters, even if they call each other such and
consider their relationship to be tantamount to that.  Nor, in my view, can a
adult man and woman who establish a platonic relationship establish a familial
nexus by acting as a devoted brother and sister or father and daughter would
act, even if they address each other as such and even if they refer to each
other as such and regard their association as tantamount to such.  Nor, in my
view, would they indeed be recognised as familial links by the ordinary man."

ordinary popular meaning of the phrase &#8220;was a member of the original
tenant&#8217;s family&#8221; would not, when considering Mr Thompson&#8217;s
family include the appellant as a member of it.  No doubt Mr Thompson and the
appellant would have referred to each other as &#8220;family&#8221;.  Mr
Thompson might well have said, with gratitude, that the appellant was
&#8220;all the family I have&#8221;.  But that is not the same thing as being a
member of the original tenant&#8217;s family for the purpose of being entitled
to an assured tenancy of the dwelling house by succession.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
agree with both My Lords that the terms of this Schedule should be reconsidered
with a view to bringing cases such as the present within the protection of
Schedule 1.  No doubt Parliament will consider whether the protection should be
that afforded by paragraph 2 or that afforded by paragraph 3 of the Schedule.
Nevertheless I am convinced that it is for Parliament to make the necessary
changes after debate when considerations which may not have been raised in this
appeal and which may not be apparent to this court can be taken into account.
For those reasons and the reasons given by My Lord, Lord Justice Waite, after
some hesitation, I would dismiss this appeal.

<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		The
questions raised in this appeal are deceptively easy to pose but I confess to

<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">1.	Was
Mr Fitzpatrick &#8220;living with the original tenant as his (or her) wife or

<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	To
answer those questions I shall consider the court&#8217;s established approach
to this part of the Rent Act, to other aids to construction and to associated

have felt some hesitation on both these points, but in the end have concluded
that it would be unduly legalistic to allow either consideration to defeat the
defendant&#8217;s claim. On the first point, if language can change its meaning
to accord with changing social attitudes, then a decision on the meaning of a
word in a statute before such a change should not continue to bind thereafter,
at all events in a case where the courts have consistently affirmed that the
word is to be understood in its ordinary accepted meaning. On the second point,
where the modern meaning is plain, we should, I think, be prepared to apply it

Borough Council -v- Simpson
</I>
[1984] 17 HLR 205 is a case very close in point. It related to a secure tenancy
which was a new form of public sector tenancy created by the Housing Act 1980.
That permitted succession on the death of the tenant to the tenant&#8217;s
spouse or another member of the tenant&#8217;s family (section 30) and section
50(3) expressly provided that &#8220; a person is a member of another&#8217;s
family...if they live together as husband and wife&#8221;. The survivor in the
lesbian partnership did not qualify for the reasons already recited in Waite
L.J.&#8217;s judgment. I do not regard myself as absolutely bound to follow
that case for both reasons advanced by Mr Jan Luba, counsel for  the appellant.
In the first place, it is a decision on a different statutory provision and in
the second place I must give effect to the contemporaneous meaning of the words
of the Rent Act. Mr Luba did not strenuously argue that the language
differences were significant, and, whilst I may not be strictly bound by the
interpretation given by this court in 
<I>Harrogate
B.C. -v- Simpson
</I>,
its authority is obviously very persuasive.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	As
to the language of the two statutes, I would make these observations. Although
the words are not identical, I confess that I can see very little difference in
the meaning to be given to &#8220;a person who was living with the original
tenant as his or her wife or husband&#8221; for Rent Act purposes and
&#8220;if...(the tenant) and that person live together as husband and
wife&#8221; for Housing Act purposes. What is different is that for Rent Act
purposes since 1988, the person living with the tenant is treated as his spouse
whereas under the Housing Act definition, that person is a member of the
tenant&#8217;s family. If the person living with the original tenant as his or
her wife or husband shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant, that
person is deemed to be something which he is not. Can he be deemed to be the
husband when he is of the same sex as the tenant or deemed to be the wife even
though he is a male? If that is so, the need for a man and a woman is less
essential under the Rent Act definition than it was in 
<I>Harrogate
B.C. -v- Simpson.
</I><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
difference in the language used is, however, much more marked in dealing with
who members of the tenant&#8217;s family are. For Housing Act purposes, the
spouse and one who lives with the tenant as husband and wife are included in
the definition of family members. Other members are closely defined and are
limited to &#8220;parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, sister,
uncle, aunt, nephew or niece&#8221; where relationships by marriage is treated
as a relationship by blood, half blood as whole blood, stepchild as his child
and illegitimate child as legitimate: see section 50(3)of the Housing Act 1980
replaced by section 113 of the Housing Act 1985, and now, with the removal of
the otiose reference to  illegitimacy, section 62 of the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1996107/">Housing Act 1996</A></A>. By
contrast there is no definition at all given to &#8220;members of the original
tenant&#8217;s family&#8221; in the Rent Act.  That contrast is made even more
sharp by the oddity that when Parliament enacted the Housing Act 1980
introducing definitions for council and housing association tenants, the Act
did not amend  schedule 1 to the Rent Act 1977 to bring private sector tenants
into line even though it then had the Rent Act in mind
<I>.
</I>It
did make minor amendment to the Rent Act in 1980 but only to substitute
&#8220;surviving spouse&#8221; for &#8220;widow&#8221;, perhaps after Oliver
L.J.. had drawn attention to this anachronism as &#8220;one of the curiosities
of the statutory provisions&#8221;: see 
<I>Watson
-v- Lucas
</I>
[1980] 1 W.L.R. 1492 at 1502C. The legislature would have been aware that
&#8220;family&#8221; was being given its contemporaneous and shifting meaning by 
<I>Dyson
Holdings -v- Fox,
</I>
subject to the guidance given by the House of Lords in 
<I>Carega
Properties -v- Sharratt.
</I>
The implication is, therefore, that Parliament was content for the courts to
decide, as and when the question arose, who was or was not a member of the
original tenant&#8217;s family.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	When
it comes to the meaning of living together as husband and wife, I readily see
the force of the submission of Mr Chapman, for the respondents, that if
Parliament disagreed with the reasoning of Watkins L.J.. in 
<I>Harrogate
Borough Council -v- Simpson
</I>
then it passed by the opportunity to say so when the Rent Act  was  amended in
1988 specifically to introduce &#8220;a person living with the original tenant
as his or her husband or wife&#8221;, and moreover to &#8220;treat (that
person) as the spouse of the original tenant.&#8221; Watkins L.J.. had accepted
the submission that:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"If
Parliament had wished homosexual relationships to be brought into the realm of
the lawfully recognised state of a living together of man and wife for the
purposes of the relevant legislation, it would plainly have so stated in that
legislation, and it has not done so.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
assumption must be, he submits, that Parliament thought the decision was
correct. It is a powerful point. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">2.	There
are other comparable statutory provisions. In the Domestic Violence and
Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976, section 2(2) provided:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"References
...to the parties to a marriage include references to 
<U>a
man and
</U>
<U>a
woman
</U>
who are living with each other in the same household as husband and
wife...&#8221; my emphasis added.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Such
language clearly justifies the view taken by Ewbank J. in 
<I>Harrowgate
B.C. -v- Simpson
</I>
when he said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
essential characteristic of living together as husband and wife, in my
judgment, is that there should be a man and a woman and that they should be
living together in the  same household&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
point can, therefore, be made, per contra Watkins L.J, that where Parliament
wished gender to be expressly determinative, Parliament can and does say so and
when it does not, gender is not critical.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
Social Security Contributions and Benefit Act 1992 set out its definitions in
section 137. It included in the definition of &#8220;family&#8221; &#8220;a
married or unmarried couple&#8221; and defined &#8220;unmarried couple&#8221;
as:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
man and a woman who are not married to each other but are living together as
husband and wife...&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Here
again Parliament is deliberately defining the couple as a man and a woman. The
point is put in sharper focus by the comparison with the earlier definition in
paragraph 3 of schedule 1 to the Supplementary Benefits Act 1976 which dealt
with the position where &#8220;two persons who are not married to each other
are living together as husband and wife...&#8221; If the two definitions mean
the same, why was there a need to change the wording?
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
construction of these various provisions and their predecessors is also quite
interesting. In 
<I>R
-v- West London Appeal Tribunal, Ex Parte Barnet April 11th 1973
</I>,
Lord Widgery C.J. said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"We
have been invited to give some guidance upon the phrase &#8220;cohabiting as
man and wife&#8221;, but for my part it is so well known that nothing I could
say about it could possibly assist in its interpretation hereafter.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless,
in 
<I>Crake
-v- Supplementary Benefits Commission
</I>
[1981] 2 F.L.R. 264, Woolf J. (as he then was) said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"If
there is the fact there is they are living together in the same household, that
may raise the question as to whether they are living together as man and wife,
and, indeed, in many circumstances may be strong evidence to show that they are
living together as man and wife; but in each case it is necessary to go on and
ascertain, in so far as this is possible, the manner in which and why they are
living together in the same household...&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	A
more recent example of legislation on this subject is given by section 2 of The
Law Reform (Succession) Act 1995 which defined the class of cohabitant able to
apply to the court for financial provision out of the estate of the deceased
partner. The new section 1A of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and
Dependants) Act 1975 now provides:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"This
subsection applies to a person if...the person was living - (a) in the same
household as the deceased, and (b) as the husband or wife of the deceased.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
the course of the second reading of the Bill in the House of Lords, Lord Meston
observed, &#8220;I assume that (the Bill) will not extend to cohabitants of the
same sex&#8221;. The Lord Chancellor replied, &#8220; &#8216;Living as husband
and wife&#8217; appears to us, as the law stands, to apply to persons of
opposite sex and not to partners of the same sex&#8221;.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	In
the cauldron in which family law reforms were enacted in 1996, with divorce
reform being aimed at upholding the sanctity of marriage, section 62 of the
Family Law Act 1966 replacing the Domestic Violence Act of 1976 to which I have
referred, repeated its definitions and defined &#8220;cohabitants&#8221; as
&#8220;a man and a woman who, although not married to each other, are living
together as husband and wife.&#8221; Once again the gender implications are put
beyond dispute.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Mention
of controversial legislation immediately prompts a reminder of section 28 of
The <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/lga1988182/">Local Government Act 1988</A> which provided that:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
local authority shall not...(b) promote the teaching in any maintained school
of the acceptability of homosexuality as a 
<U>pretended</U>
family relationship,&#8221; my emphasis added.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
inference there is obvious: Parliament was then - and in that context -
unwilling to accept a homosexual relationship as a family relationship.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	After
I had begun this judgment, I discovered even more pertinent Parliamentary
consideration of this and allied topics. When the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1996107/">Housing Act 1996</A></A> was before
Parliament, the Standing Committee accepted an amendment to section 17(4) of
The <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ha1988107/">Housing Act 1988</A></A> (succession to assured periodic tenancy)  as well as
amendment to section 113 of the Housing Act 1985 as proposed by Ms Glenda
Jackson to the effect that succession should pass not only to &#8220;a person
who was living with the tenant as his or her wife or husband&#8221; but that it
should also pass to &#8220;where they are of the same sex and (the tenant) and
that person live together in a corresponding relationship.&#8221; When,
however, the Bill came back to Parliament, (and when, incidentally, Mr Ashby
seems to have referred to the Appellant&#8217;s position),  the Minister sought
to reverse that change. He felt that (Hansard 30th April 1996 Column 985):-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
joint tenancy is the better solution, but there may be situations where a
person has been sharing a household with someone else who is a sole tenant but
for some reason has not sought to have the tenancy converted to a joint one.
When the tenant dies the other person will not have the right to take up that
tenancy. In such cases if the person had been living with the tenant for a year
before the tenant&#8217;s death, had been looking after the tenant, or had, or
accepted, responsibility for his or her dependant, we would normally expect the
local authority to grant the tenancy to that person or find them suitable
alternative accommodation...There has been concern about a lack of uniformity
among local authorities in how they respond to such situations. I propose to
deal with that by issuing guidance shortly, which will set out unambiguously
the Government&#8217;s view that, taking into account the need to make the best
use of their stock, local authorities should normally provide - those will be
the words that will appear in the guidance - for the type of cases I have
described by granting either joint tenancies or a further tenancy where the
sole tenant has died. That will be unequivocal guidance, and it will not be
confined to couples with a sexual relationship. We will pay close attention to
the way in which local authorities implement it.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
column 986 he said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"...the
clause moved by the Hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson)
referred to people living a relationship corresponding to that of husband and
wife. I draw the conclusion that that could bear only one interpretation. 
<U>My
concern was not to exclude those circumstances
</U>
but to widen them, so that people living in the sort of relationships I have
described would also be covered by the scope of my proposals. I am proposing a
more inclusive alternative, not an exclusive one,&#8221; my emphasis added.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">As
a result the Bill passed without those changes being effected and consequently
&#8220;members of a  person&#8217;s family&#8221; are defined in sections 62
and 140 in the same terms as they appear in section 113 of the Housing Act 1985
(adapted in the light of the Family Reform Act 1987 to remove the unnecessary
references to illegitimacy.)
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
do not find it easy to draw any clear-cut conclusion from this excursus into
comparable legislation. On the one hand, if &#8220;living together as husband /
man and wife&#8221; has such a settled meaning that the couple have to be of
different sex, why is it  necessary sometimes specifically to say that the
relationship has to be between a man and a woman? The truth may be the
Parliamentary draftsman, omniscient though he is, sometimes simply did not
think about these matters at all, but it is heresy to say that.

</U></I><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
agree with my Lords that we should not permit sociological evidence to be given
to assist in finding the current ordinary meaning of the words we have to
construe. That may come as some surprise to our brothers and sisters in Canada
where very interesting developments are occurring, aided by the kind of expert
evidence we have rejected. These developments have been made possible by the
use of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human
Rights Act 1985. We were referred to 
<I>Re
Attorney General of Canada and Mossop
</I>
100 D.L.R. 658 where the issue was whether an individual in a long term
homosexual relationship was properly denied bereavement leave payable to the
members of a deceased employee&#8217;s &#8220;immediate family&#8221; which
included a &#8220;common law spouse&#8221; defined to mean a person of the
opposite sex. The question was whether this was a prohibited discrimination on
the grounds of &#8220;family status.&#8221; The majority defined family
narrowly in terms of the traditional family being one composed of a married man
and woman and their children. The minority were prepared to take a broader view
because &#8220;not all variables are present in any given family and there is
no one variable that is present in all families.&#8221; In the view of the
minority a family might be &#8220;two or more persons who share resources,
share responsibility for decisions, share values and goals, and have
commitments to one another over time.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
have discovered that challenges along these lines have continued. In 
<I>Egan
-v- Canada
</I>
[1995] 124 D.L.R. 609,  the issue was whether the younger partner of a
homosexual couple should be treated as the elder&#8217;s &#8220;spouse&#8221;
for the purposes of old age pension. Section 15 of the Charter prohibits
discrimination based on &#8220;race, national or ethnic origin, colour,
religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.&#8221; The court was
unanimous in finding that sexual orientation was a ground of discrimination. Le
Forest J. said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"I
have no difficulty accepting the appellants&#8217; contention that whether or
not sexual orientation is based on biological or physiological factors, which
may be a matter of some controversy, it is a deeply personal characteristic
that is either unchangeable or changeable only at unacceptable personal cost,
and so falls within the ambit of section 15 protection as being analogous to
the enumerated grounds.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
court was divided as to whether this was in fact discrimination or not. In the
judgment of four members of the court, per Iacobucci J. at paragraph 180:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Looking
at the Act from the perspective of the appellants, it can be seen that the
legislation denies homosexual couples equal benefit of the law. The Act does
this not on the basis of merit or need, but solely on the basis of sexual
orientation. The definition of &#8220;spouse&#8221; as someone of the opposite
sex reinforces the stereotype that homosexuals cannot and do not form lasting,
caring, mutually supportive relationships with economic interdependence in the
same manner as heterosexual couples. The appellants&#8217; relationship vividly
demonstrates the error of that approach.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">That
might have been written with this appeal in mind.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	This
has been carried even further by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 
<I>M
&amp; H -v- Attorney General of Ontario, February  1997
</I>
upholding the decision reported at  [1996] 132 D.L.R. 538. That involved a
claim made after the breakdown of a lesbian relationship in which one party
claimed against the other interim and permanent support under the Family Law
Act 1990 which defined &#8220;spouse&#8221; to include a man and a woman who
were not married to each other and had lived together in a &#8220;conjugal
relationship&#8221;. That definition was held to discriminate against those who
lived together in a same-sex relationship and  to escape censure, a &#8220;man
and a woman&#8221; who have cohabited together in a conjugal relationship
should be read as &#8220;two persons&#8221; who have cohabited together.

[1994] 1-3 I.H.R.R. 97  the Human Rights Committee concluded that Article 26 of

<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	So
far as the European Convention on Human Rights is concerned, the respondent in

B.C. -v- Simpson
</I>,
having failed to get leave to appeal to the House of Lords went to the European
Commission. They held :-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"As
regards family life, the Commission recalls that it has already found that,
despite the modern evolution of attitudes towards homosexuality, a  stable
homosexual relationship between two men does not fall within the scope of the
right to respect for family life ensured by Article 8 of the Convention.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">As
regards private life, the Commission accepted that the applicant&#8217;s
relationship did constitute a matter affecting their private life but as the
applicant then lived alone there was no current interference. Even if there was
a breach of her right to respect for her home, such interference was in
accordance with the law and was necessary for the protection of the contractual
rights of the landlord to have the property back at the end of the tenancy. The
Commissioner accepted that the treatment accorded to the applicant was
different from the treatment she would have received if the partners had been
of different sexes and, accepted, it would seem, that sexual orientation was a
sufficient ground of discrimination but the Commission considered that the
family (to which the relationship of a heterosexual unmarried couple living
together as  husband and wife can be assimilated), merited special protection
in society and was therefore justified.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	So
far as I can check, the decisions upon which the court there relied were 
<I>X

</I>
and 
<I>Kerkhoven
-v- The Netherlands, Application No 15666/89.

Y &amp; Z -v- United Kingdom
</I>
[75/1995/581/667] the European Court of Human Rights recorded  the
Commission&#8217;s opinion that the relationship between X &amp; Y, where X was
a transsexual, could not be equated with that of a lesbian couple since X was
living in society as a man, having undergone gender reassignment surgery. The
court, noting that distinction without either agreeing with it or dissenting
from it, did say in paragraph 36 that:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"When
deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount to &#8220;family
life&#8221;, a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couple
lived together, the length of their relationship and whether they have
demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by
any other means...&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
Court accordingly found Article 8 to be applicable for transsexuals but, to
date, homosexuals seem to be excluded.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	As
I draft this judgment I hear that the case of 
<I>Grant

begins its hearing before the European Court to decide whether the applicant, a
female employee, has been discriminated against on the grounds of sex in
breach of the Equal Pay Act 1970, Article 119 of the Treaty and/or the
Directive. Her contract entitled her to certain travel concessions for:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"(a).
the employee&#8217;s spouse (i.e. legally married husband or wife) and
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	(b)

statutory declaration that a meaningful relationship (i.e. living together) has
existed for a period of two years or over.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
applicant was refused the concession for her same-sex partner. The Industrial
Tribunal referred the matter to the European Court to decide whether this
discrimination based on sexual orientation is unlawful. Time will tell.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	The
European Court may well have another opportunity to consider the matter because
Lightman J. has referred to it the question of whether or not the dismissal of
a homosexual serviceman from the Royal Navy can be justified under Article 2.2
of the Equal Treatment Directive (76/207/EEC).  In his judgment in

</I>
The Times 13th March 1997:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Homosexual
orientation is a reality today which the law must recognise and adjust to, and
it may well be thought appropriate that the fundamental principal of equality
and the irrelevance of a person&#8217;s sex and sexual identity demand that the

orientation are no longer disadvantaged in terms of employment, save and unless
the discrimination is justified under Article 2.2....

ground it could easily been done, but to my mind it plainly was not.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		I
note the resolution of the European Parliament of 8th February 1994 to sweep
away any unequal treatment based on sexual orientation. I note too how a number
of European countries have begun moves in that direction by permitting same-sex
couples to enter into agreements regulating their property  and inheritance
rights just as non-married  heterosexual couples can do. This is allowed in
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Greenland, Iceland, Hungary and Holland. In the
Australian Capital Territory the Domestic Act 1994 has gone so far as to define
&#8220;domestic relationship&#8221; as:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
personal relationship (other than a legal marriage) between two adults in which
one provides personal or financial commitment and support of a domestic nature

unconstitutional to deny homosexuals the right to marry and the United States

though these developments may be, they are no more than straws in the wind. Of
much greater direct significance is the decision of the New York Court of
Appeal in 
<I>Braschi
-v- Stahl Associates Company
</I>
[1989] N.Y.S. 2nd 784. For those in the majority, it was fundamental that
&#8220;in construing the words of a statute &#8220;the legislative intent is
the great and the controlling principle&#8221;.&#8221; At p. 787 it held:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"To
accomplish its goals, the legislature recognised that not only would rents have
to be controlled, but that evictions would have to be regulated and controlled
as well...The manifest intent of this section is to restrict the
landowner&#8217;s ability to evict a narrow class of occupants other than the
tenant of record.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">At
p. 788/789 they reached their conclusions that:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"We
conclude that the term family...should not be rigidly restricted to those
people who have formalised their relationship by obtaining, for instance, a
marriage certificate or an adoption order. The intended protection against
sudden eviction should not rest on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic
history, but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life.
In the context of eviction, a more realistic, and certainly equally valid, view
of a family includes two adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long
term and characterised by an emotional and financial commitment and
interdependence....This definition of &#8220;family&#8221; is consistent with
both of the competing purposes of the rent-control laws: the protection of
individuals from sudden dislocation and the gradual transition to a free market
system. Family members, whether or not related by blood, or law who have always
treated the apartment as their family home will be protected against the
hardship of eviction following the death of the named tenant, thereby
furthering the legislature&#8217;s goals of preventing dislocation and
preserving family units which might otherwise be broken apart upon conviction.
This approach will foster the transition from rent control to rent
stabilisation by drawing a distinction between those individuals who are, in
fact, genuine family members, and those who are mere room mates.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
 minority did not appear to take great issue with that view of the purpose of
the Act, but in their judgment at p. 793:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
State concerns underlying this provision include the orderly and just
succession of property interests (which includes protecting a deceased&#8217;s
spouse and family from loss of their long time home) and the professed State
objective that there be a gradual transition from Government regulation to a
normal market of free bargaining between landlord  and tenant.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
the conclusion of the  minority, however:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Those
objectives require a weighing of the interests of certain individuals living
with the tenant of record at his or her death and the interests of the landlord
in regaining possession of its property and re-renting it under the less
onerous rent-stabilisation laws. The interests are properly balanced if the
regulation&#8217;s exception is applied by using objectively verifiable
relationships based on blood, marriage and adoption, as the State has
historically done in estate succession laws, family court acts and similar
legislation....Such an interpretation promotes certainty and consistency in the
law and obviates the need for drawn out hearings and litigation focusing on
such intangibles as the strength and duration of the relationship and the
extent of the emotional and finical interdependency.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">These
were powerful arguments both ways.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><I><U>MY
APPROACH TO THE QUESTION OF CONSTRUCTION
</U></I><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">1.	I
begin with the purpose of the Rent Act which is essentially to give tenants
fair rents and a status of irremovability. In 
<I>Curl
-v- Angelo
</I>
[1948] 2 All E.R. 189 at 192, Lord Greene M.R. described &#8220;the real
fundamental object of the Act&#8221; to be &#8220;protecting a tenant from
being turned out of his home.&#8221; In 
<I>Lloyd
-v- Sadler
</I>
[1978] Q.B. 774 Lawton L.J.. said at 790:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
object of the Act of 1968 was to give security of tenure to persons...The Act
of 1968 took away many of the landlords rights at common law and was intended
to do so for the benefit of tenants.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">As
Lord Greene M.R. had earlier said in 
<I>Cumming
-v- Danson
</I>
[1942] 112 L.J.. K.B. 145 at 146 that the Acts were:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"...
for the protection of tenants, and not Acts for the penalising of
landlords.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
teleological interpretation supports the conclusion that there is no
justification for limiting the class of persons entitled to the benefit of the
Rent Act on the  basis that the interference with the landlord&#8217;s right to
possession should be curtailed because the Act has a penal effect: on the
contrary, the broad purpose of the Act is to preserve the family home for
tenants and their successors. Consequently, those who occupy the property as
their home should wherever it is possible - but of course not beyond that - be
given protection against eviction.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">2.	As
 I have already explained, the words of this Act must be given their
contemporary meaning. Professor Ronald Dworkin expressed the point well in
&#8220;Law&#8217;s Empire&#8221;, 1986, p.348, when he said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"The
judge interprets not just the statute&#8217;s text but its life, the process
that begins before it becomes law and extends far beyond that moment....His
(the judge&#8217;s) interpretation changes as the story develops.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Since
families are dynamic, the statutory interpretation must equally reflect the
motive forces, physical or moral, affecting behaviour and change in domestic
organisation. On reading Professor Zimmermann&#8217;s article, &#8220;Statutes
and the Common Law: a Continental Perspective,&#8221; [1997] C.L.J. 315, 323, I
realise, with some apprehension (but with some pleasure at the recollection of
it) how close I am to a return to Celsus, The Digest of Justinian, D 1, 3, 17,
whose rule of interpretation was, &#8220;
<I>Scire
leges non hoc est verba earum tenere, sed vim ac potestatem:&#8221;
</I>
to know the laws is not a matter of sticking to their words, but of grasping
their force and tendency.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">3.	Since
the inception of the Rent Acts in or before 1920, the home of members of the
tenant&#8217;s family has been preserved for them. As the decided cases show,
the meaning of family has been progressively extended. The movement has been
away from the confines of relationships by blood and by marriage to the reality
of family life, and from 
<I>de
jure
</I>
to 
<I>de
facto
</I>
relationships. We need to analyse how that has come to pass. In 1950 Mr Ekins
was not a member of Mrs Smith&#8217;s family because, per Asquith L. J., the
decisions which bound them limited membership of the same &#8220;family&#8221;
to three relationships: firstly that of a child; secondly those constituted by
way of legitimate marriage like that between a husband and wife; and thirdly
relationships whereby one person becomes 
<I>in
loco parentis
</I>
to another. In that case the masquerade as husband and wife was not enough. The
form of their relationship - an unmarried couple - overcame  the substance of
the way they functioned akin to a married couple. By 1976 Mrs Fox had become a
member  of the family because the ordinary man recognised that this was not a
relationship, per James L.J., &#8220;of a casual or intermittent character
...bearing indications of impermanence (as) would not come within the popular
concept of a family unit.&#8221; The trend in the cases, as I see them, is to
shift the focus, or the emphasis, from structure and components to function and
appearance - what a family does rather than what it is, or putting it another
way, a family is what a family does. I see this as a functionalist approach to
construction as opposed to a formalist approach. Thus whether the 
<I>Carega
Properties
</I>
test is satisfied i.e. whether there is  &#8220;at least a broadly recognisable
de facto familial nexus,&#8221; or a conjugal nexus, depends on how closely the
alternative family or couple resemble the traditional family or husband and
wife in function if not in precise form.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">4.	We
do not have (or should I say we do not 
<U>yet</U>
have?) the equivalent of the Canadian Charter Rights which enables the judges
to strike down offensive discriminatory legislation. I must, therefore, be
faithful to Parliament&#8217;s sovereign will. Nevertheless, I am entitled to
presume that Parliament always intends to conform to the rule of law as a
constitutional principle and accordingly to respect the constitutional rights
of the individual to enjoy equality under the law. I agree with the majority of
the Canadian Supreme Court in
<I>
Egan -v- Canada 
</I>at
p. 631 where L&#8217;Heureux-Dube J. said:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"Equality,
as that concept is enshrined as a fundamental human right within section 15 of
the Charter, means nothing if does not represent a commitment to recognising
each person&#8217;s equal worth as a human  being, regardless of individual
differences. Equality means that our society cannot tolerate legislative
distinctions that treat certain people as second - class citizens, that demean
them, that treat them as less capable for no good reason, or that otherwise
offend fundamental human dignity.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">If,
therefore, there is doubt about the ordinary meaning of the words of the
statute, I would strain to place upon them that construction which produces a
dignified result consistent with the purpose of the Act.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">5.	To
exclude same-sex couples from the protection the Rent Act proclaims the
inevitable message that society judges their relationship to be less worthy of
respect, concern and consideration than the relationship between members of the
opposite sex. The fundamental human dignity of the homosexual couple is
severely and palpably affected by the impugned distinction. The distinction is
drawn on grounds relating to their personal characteristics, their sexual
orientation. If the law is as my Lords state it to be, then it discriminates
against a not insignificant proportion of the population who will justly
complain  that they have been denied their constitutional right to equal
treatment under the law.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">6.	There
being no remedy to cure such injustice, my approach will, therefore, be to say
that if I find the statute ambiguous, or even if I left in doubt as to its
meaning, then I should err on the side of preventing that discrimination.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><I><U>WAS
THE APPELLANT LIVING WITH THE ORIGINAL TENANT AS HIS WIFE OR HUSBAND?
</U></I><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">1.	&#8220;As&#8221;
means &#8220;in the manner of&#8221; and suggests how the couple functioned,
not what they were. I agree with the test of Woolf J in 
<I>Crake
-v- Supplementary Benefits Commission
</I>
which, so far as I can tell, was not referred to this court in 
<I>Harrogate
B.C. -v- Simpson.
</I>
There being no dispute but that the appellant and the deceased were living
together, it is &#8220;necessary to go on and ascertain in so far as this is
possible, the manner in which and why they (were) living together in the same
household.&#8221; If asked, &#8220;Why?&#8221;, would not both they and also
the heterosexual couple equally well reply, &#8220;Because we love each other
and are committed to devote comfort and support to each other.&#8221; I can
readily envisage that the immediate response to the question, &#8220;How do you
two live together?&#8221; may well be, &#8220;As a gay couple.&#8221;  But when
the next question is asked, &#8220;In what manner do you, a gay couple, live
together?&#8221; would their answer be any different from that given by the
heterosexual couple save only in the one respect that in their case their
sexual relations are homosexual, not heterosexual? No distinction can sensibly
be drawn between the two couples in terms of love, nurturing, fidelity,
durability, emotional and economic interdependence - to name but some and no
means all of the hallmarks of a relationship between a husband and his wife.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">3.	With
regard to the only distinguishing feature, sexual activity, that is a function
of the relationship of a husband and his wife, a man and his mistress and it is
a function of homosexual lovers. That the activity takes place between members
of different sexes or of the same sex is a matter of form not function. Since
the test I would apply is functionalistic, the formalistic difference can be
ignored.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">4.	It
was Parliament&#8217;s will in 1996 that public sector homosexual partners
enjoyed protection from eviction, albeit only by use of guidelines issued to
the local authority. Given that the broad intention of the Rent Act is to
protect against the loss of one&#8217;s home, then conferring protection by
extending paragraph 2(2) to include the homosexual partnership is to provide
the private sector tenants with security comparable to their public sector
counterparts.  Since the Glenda Jackson amendment was withdrawn in order not to
exclude the homosexual couple but to extend protection to others, I consider I
am more likely to reflect Parliament&#8217;s will by finding for the appellant
than by finding against him.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">5.	I
would say there is no essential difference between a homosexual and a
heterosexual couple and accordingly I would find that the appellant had lived
with the deceased tenant as his husband or wife.  
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><I><U>WAS
THE APPELLANT A MEMBER OF THE ORIGINAL TENANT&#8217;S FAMILY?
</U></I><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">1.	The
Oxford English dictionary defines family as:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"1.	The
servants of a house or establishment; the household.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	2.	The
body of persons who live in one house and under one head, including parents,
children, servants etc.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	3.	A
group of persons consisting of the parents and their children whether actually
living together or not; in the wider sense, the unity formed by those who are
nearly connected by blood or affinity.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Mr
Chapman contends for the third  meaning. This is the &#8220;traditional&#8221;
family. The moment one uses the adjective to qualify the noun, the clearer it
is that the meaning is wide.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">2.	The
textbook The Family, Law and Society, 4th Addition by Hoggett (Mrs Justice
Hale), Pearl (His Honour Judge Pearl), Cooke and Bates state on the first page
of their work:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"In
the England of the 1990s, we must not assume that the answer to the question
&#8220;What is a family?&#8221; is necessarily going to produce a simple and
straight forward response....The following extract comes from the Judicial
Studies Board&#8217;s handbook on ethnic minority issues [1994]:...
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Despite
the fact that these images may have some basis in reality, as rigid stereotypes
they can be misleading and dangerous. They over-generalise some tendencies, and
conceal the existence of considerable diversity in family composition among
Britain&#8217;s minority ethnic communities. They also do nothing to help with
understanding why there may be differences in family patterns between ethnic
groups.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Should
one not, therefore, also question the validity of a heterosexual stereotype for
the family?
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">3.	The
test has to be whether the relationship of the appellant to the deceased was
one where there is at least a broadly recognisable de facto familial nexus. I
would not define that familial nexus in terms of its structures or components:
I would rather focus on familial functions. The question is more what a family
does rather than what a family is. A family unit is a social organisation which
functions through its linking its members closely together. The functions may
be procreative, sexual, sociable, economic, emotional. The list is not
exhaustive. Not all families function in the same way. Save for the ability to
procreate, these functions were present in the relationship between the
deceased and the appellant.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">4.	Whilst
there clearly is no right of self-determination it cannot be immaterial to have
regard to the view the parties have of their own relationship. If the officious
commuter on the Clapham omnibus had paid a visit to the deceased&#8217;s
household, asked all the relevant questions about their relationship and asked
the deceased finally, &#8220;What is Mr Fitzpatrick to you? Is he one of the
family?&#8221;, it seems to me to be inconceivable that the deceased would not
have testily suppressed him by replying, &#8220;Of course he is.&#8221; I doubt
whether the ordinary man would be surprised by the answer as he apparently
would have been hearing Ms Simpson. I am quite certain that he would not treat
the answer as an abuse of the English language. Indeed I am satisfied that the
ordinary man is liberated enough to accept in 1997 or even in 1994 looking
broadly at the appellant&#8217;s life and comparing it with the other rich
patterns of family life he knows, that the bond between the appellant and the
deceased was 
<I>de
facto
</I>
familial.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">5.	I
would therefore conclude that if, which is my preferred view, they were not
living as a husband and his wife would live, then at least they were living as
members of a family.    
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><I><U>CONCLUSIONS</U></I><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	Writing
on &#8220;Financial Rights in Relationships outside Marriage: a Decade of
Reforms in Australia,&#8221; International  Journal of Law and the Family
[1995], 233 Professor Bailey-Harris says:-
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	"A
pluralist society requires the law not merely to tolerate but rather to
recognise and support diversity in family formation - in other words to
authenticate a range of family forms.&#8221;
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
my judgment our society has shown itself to be tolerant enough to free itself
from the burdens of stereotype and prejudice in all their subtle and ugly
manifestations. The common man may be vaguely disapproving of the homosexual
relationship which is not for him but, having shrugged his shoulders, he would
recognise that the relationship was to all intents and purposes a marriage
between those partners. They lived a life akin to that of any husband and wife.
They were so bound together that they constituted a family.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
would, for my part, answer both questions posed at the beginning of this
judgment  in the affirmative.
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	I
have not reached this decision lightly. In truth, it has caused me a great deal
of anxiety. I have worried that I have gone too far. If it is a matter for
Parliament, and not for me, I hope Parliament will consider it soon. I have
endeavoured to reflect public opinion as I see it but I am very conscious that
public opinion on this topic is a continuum and it is not easy to see where the
line is to be drawn. As the Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham said in
