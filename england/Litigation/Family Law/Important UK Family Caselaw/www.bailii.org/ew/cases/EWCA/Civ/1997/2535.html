<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LADY JUSTICE BUTLER-SLOSS: I will ask Thorpe LJ to give the 
first judgment. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE THORPE: This application concerns two Nigerian 
boys, A., and D., who are respectively 10 and 8 years of age. The litigation has 
been principally between their biological mother and their psychological mother 
and it has presented Singer J with extraordinarily difficult decisions on at 
least two occasions. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>It is unnecessary to record the history in any detail but in the 
broadest outline the two boys have lived throughout their lives with their 
foster parent, Mrs P., in Middlesbrough. There they have no influences or 
experiences that would help them to comprehend and grow up within their Nigerian 
heritage and culture. Their mother lives in London and the arrangements for 
contact, which for some years operated reasonably smoothly, ran into troubled 
waters and that difficulty was exacerbated by the commencement of litigation. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The principal judgment to determine whether the two boys should 
continue to live with their psychological mother or whether they should be 
transferred to their biological mother was taken by Singer J on 30 July 1996. 
His conclusion in a finely balanced case was that they must move, for their 
longer term needs outweighed the undoubted short term trauma that a move would 
engender. That judgment was the subject of application to this court which did 
not succeed and accordingly the future direction of the children's lives was 
determined by that primary judgment. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>There were a number of applications to the Judge thereafter. We 
have been furnished with transcripts of a hearing on 19 December 1996 and a 
hearing on 25 April 1997. All were concerned in that period with the difficulty 
of implementation, since the boys' reaction to the judgment of 30 July 1996 was 
to demonstrate their hostility and their determination to resist in difficult 
and distressing behaviour in contact with their mother. It is possible to see 
that the prospects of overcoming the enormous practical difficulties of 
implementation were evaporating in the Spring of this year. Quite properly on 
behalf of the biological mother applications were mounted for a Tipstaff order 
to enforce. It is perfectly plain from the transcript of the judgment on 25 
April 1997 that the Judge was not prepared to contemplate such a potentially 
damaging method and in preference set up arrangements for a full investigation 
of the way ahead at a fixture in June. The judgment that resulted from that 
fixture, reversed the decision of July 1996. It is dated 19 June and is the 
judgment which Miss Platt, on behalf of the biological mother, seeks leave to 
appeal. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Her application is mounted on the basis of fresh evidence which 
shows that the very carefully prepared meetings between the applicant and the 
two boys have been surprisingly successful. The affidavit of D. S., a social 
worker with the London Borough of Camden, shows particularly in paragraph 26 
that the first meeting between the mother and children went off surprisingly 
well and far beyond the anticipation of the professionals. The same register was 
made of a later attempt at contact. So, says Miss Platt, had the Judge had that 
foresight he might well have taken a different line. Of course the contrary 
interpretation is that the boys, reassured by the judgment of 19 June, reversing 
the management and confirming them in their placement with Mrs P. has freed them 
to relate more naturally to their mother. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In advocating the draft notice of appeal Miss Platt says that 
the Judge is to be criticised for his failure to adopt a robust effort at 
enforcement not short of the physical removal of these children from their 
Middlesbrough home by the agency of the Tipstaff. She says there is precedent 
for that in the decision of this court in relation to the Zulu boy, S. That is 
an argument that seems to me to be a perilous one since subsequent developments 
in the life of the Zulu boy demonstrate that the endeavour to override his 
deep-seated attachment to his psychological mother proved disastrous in outcome. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Finally, Miss Platt says that ground four of her draft notice is 
the kernel of her complaint. The Judge placed too much weight on the wishes and 
the behaviour of the children and insufficient weight on the unanimous view of 
all the experts as to their long term needs and welfare. That submission is 
simply unsustainable against the reality that between the two fundamental 
judgments there had been a major shift in expert opinion to the extent that even 
Dr Sein, the expert advocating the principle of return to the biological mother, 
accepted that it was an agonisingly difficult principle to apply to this case. 
He even registered his relief at the impossibility of embarking on his theory 
that a bridging placement should be attempted, since investigation had revealed 
that there was simply no bridging placement available. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Judge had before him an agonisingly difficult choice. It 
seems to me that realistically it would be impossible within the parameters 
defined for the role of this court to contend that the decision at which he in 
fact arrived was the wrong decision, particularly since it was a decision that 
had the support of the Official Solicitor acting for the children. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Miss Platt has presented her application with great skill and 
has in the most attractive way said what there is to be said in favour of 
appellate review. But it is, in my judgment, a hopeless application. This is a 
decision at first instance which this court recognises to be a discretionary 
decision arrived at after very careful consideration of all the issues. It is a 
decision that is simply not open to challenge since I, for my part, can see no 
realistic prospect of this court intervening or altering in any way the order 
that was made by the Judge. It is reassuring to know that this Judge retains the 
management of the case. He has already made a further order in respect of 
contact on, I think, 3 September and, by that order, he has specifically 
provided for a further hearing on 24 November when the question of continuing 
contact to the children will be determined. There is an obvious possibility that 
building on the success achieved since June there will be a gradual development 
of the relationship between the mother and the children, not through the 
absolute order transferring residence from one household to another but by the 
progressive development of contact, of course moving to liberal staying contact 
within the school holidays. But it does seem to me that it is upon that prospect 
that the applicant would wisely rest her future hopes. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LADY JUSTICE BUTLER-SLOSS: I agree that the application for 
leave should be refused. One can very well understand why Miss Platt's client 
sought the leave of this court, the Judge having dramatically changed his mind 
between two years. But I have to say for my part that his change of mind and 
reversal of his order was courageous and was a decision which I do not believe 
in the agonisingly difficult circumstances of this case the Court of Appeal 
could possibly interfere with. The more difficult the decision the less easy it 
is for the Court of Appeal to intervene. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Consequently I entirely agree with my Lord that there is no 
prospect of success on appeal and that all that can be said for the mother are 
two things. One is she could not have had her case better put to this court and, 
secondly, that she should reflect upon the wise words of my Lord, Thorpe LJ, 
that the way forward should be to make contact work and have increasingly long 
periods of, I hope, a happy relationship with the children during the periods 
that they go to her. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Order: Application for leave to adduce further evidence granted; 
application for leave to appeal refused; no order as to costs save legal aid 
taxation of the applicant and respondent's costs; direction given re 
identification of parties; transcript of judgments to be provided at public 
expense. <BR></DIV>
