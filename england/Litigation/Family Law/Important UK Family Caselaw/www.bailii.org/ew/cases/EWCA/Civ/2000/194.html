<P></P>
<P><B>THE PRESIDENT: </B>These four appeals on issues arising out of contact 
applications have certain features in common. In each case a father큦 
application for direct contact <U>has</U> been refused by the circuit judge 
against a background of domestic violence between the spouses or partners. We 
are grateful to Wall J, the Chairman of the Children Act Sub-Committee of the 
Advisory Board on Family Law, for permission to look at their Report on parental 
contact in domestic violence cases and their recommendations recently presented 
to the Lord Chancellor and now published. At our request, the Official Solicitor 
acted as Amicus in each case and we are most grateful to him for instructing Dr 
J.C. Sturge, consultant child psychiatrist in consultation with Dr Glaser, 
consultant child psychiatrist to provide a joint report and to advise on the 
four appeals and to Mr Posnansky QC, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, for 
the helpful arguments addressed to us. We heard the four cases together and 
reserved judgment in each case. I propose to comment on the Report on domestic 
violence, (the Report), and the expert psychiatric evidence, (the psychiatric 
report), presented to us before turning to the facts of each appeal.</P>
<P><BR><B>The Report</B> <BR>The Report by the Children Act Sub-committee 
underlined the importance of the question of domestic violence in the context of 
parental contact to children. Domestic violence takes many forms and should be 
broadly defined. The perpetrator may be female as well as male. Involvement may 
be indirect as well as direct. There needs to be greater awareness of the effect 
of domestic violence on children, both short-term and long-term, as witnesses as 
well as victims and also the impact on the residential parent. An outstanding 
concern of the court should be the nature and extent of the risk to the child 
and to the residential parent and that proper arrangements should be put in 
place to safeguard the child and the residential parent from risk of further 
physical or emotional harm. In cases where domestic violence is raised as a 
reason for refusing or limiting contact, the Report makes it clear that the 
allegations ought to be addressed by the court at the earliest opportunity<U> 
</U>and findings of fact made so as to establish the truth or otherwise of those 
allegations and decide upon the likely effect, if any, those findings 
<U>could</U> have on the court큦 decision on contact. The Report set out 
suggested guidelines to which I shall refer at the end of this judgment. 
<BR><B>The Psychiatric Report</B></P>
<P>Dr Sturge and Dr Glaser in their joint report to this Court had the 
opportunity to see the responses to the Sub-Committee Consultation paper and to 
read the Report and recommendations. Their psychiatric report was read and 
approved by a number of other consultant child psychiatrists and incorporates 
the views of a distinguished group of consultants. We are extremely grateful to 
them for their wise advice.</P>
<P>They set out the psychiatric principles of contact between the child and the 
non-resident parent. They saw the centrality of the child as all-important and 
the promotion of his or her mental health the central issue amid the tensions 
surrounding the adults in dispute. The decisions about contact should be 
child-centred and related to the specific child in its present circumstances but 
acknowledge that the child큦 needs will alter over different stages of 
development. The purpose of the proposed contact must be overt and abundantly 
clear and have the potential for benefiting the child in some way. The benefits 
of contact to the father were set out in detail including, the importance of the 
father as one of the two parents, in the child큦 sense of identity and value, 
the role model provided by a father and the male contribution to parenting of 
children and its relevance to the child큦 perception of family life as an adult. 
<BR>They set out many different purposes of contact, including: the maintenance 
or reparation of beneficial relationships, the sharing of information and 
knowledge and the testing of reality for the child. They set out the more 
limited advantages of indirect contact which included: <BR>experience of 
continued interest by the absent parent, knowledge and information about the 
absent parent, keeping open the possibility of development of the relationship 
and the opportunity for reparation. <BR>They pointed out the importance of the 
manner in which indirect contact was managed by the resident parent. <BR>They 
identified a number of risks of direct contact. The overall risk was that of 
failing to meet and actually undermining the child큦 developmental needs or even 
causing emotional abuses and damage directly through contact or as a consequence 
of the contact. Specifically that included: escalating the climate of conflict 
around the child which would undermine the child큦 general stability and sense 
of emotional well being. The result was a tug of loyalty and a sense of 
responsibility for the conflict in all children except young babies which 
affected the relationships of the child with both parents. There might be direct 
abusive experiences, including emotional abuse by denigration of the child or 
the child큦 resident carer. There might be continuation of unhealthy 
relationships such as dominant or bullying relationships, those created by fear, 
bribes or emotional blackmail, by undermining the child큦 sense of stability and 
continuity by deliberately or inadvertently setting different moral standards or 
standards of behaviour, by little interest in the child himself or by 
unstimulating or uninteresting contact. They indicated a series of situations 
where there were risks to contact: where there were unresolved situations, where 
the contact was unreliable and the child frequently let down, where the child 
was attending contact against his wishes so he felt undermined, where there was 
little prospect for change such as wholly implacable situations, where there was 
the stress on the child and resident carer of ongoing proceedings or frequently 
re-initiated proceedings.<BR>These are all matters with which experienced family 
judges and magistrates in family proceedings courts are all too familiar. I 
have, for my part however, found the outline provided by the psychiatric report 
very helpful.<BR><B>Domestic Violence Situations</B></P>
<P>The psychiatric report then moved to the central issue of domestic violence. 
They agreed with the Sub-Committee Report that there needs to be greater 
awareness of the effect of domestic violence on children, both short-term and 
long-term, as witnesses as well as victims. The research was entirely consistent 
in showing the deleterious effects on children of exposure to domestic violence 
and that children were affected as much by exposure to violence as to being 
involved in it. All children were affected by significant and repeated 
inter-partner violence even if not directly involved. Research indicates that 
even when children did not continue in violent situations emotional trauma 
continued to be experienced. The context of the overall situation was highly 
relevant to decision making. The contribution of psychiatric disorder to 
situations of domestic violence and emotional abuse must be considered. In 
situations of contact there might be a continuing sense of fear of the violent 
parent by the child. The child might have post-traumatic anxieties or symptoms 
the proximity of<U> </U>the non-resident violent parent might re-arouse or 
perpetuate. There might be a continuing awareness of the fear the violent parent 
aroused in the child큦 main carer. The psychiatric report highlighted the 
possible effects of such situations on the child큦 own attitudes to violence, to 
forming parenting relationships and the role of fathers. Research shows<U> 
</U>that attitudes in boys were particularly affected.</P>
<P><BR><B>Refusal of child to see parent.</B><BR>The psychiatric report 
addressed the problem of the child who was adamant that he did not wish to see 
the parent. The following factors ought to be accepted <BR>(i) the child must be 
listened to and taken seriously;<BR>(ii) the age and understanding of the child 
are highly relevant;<BR>(iii) the younger and more dependent child in a positive 
relationship with the resident parent will be influenced by the parent큦 views 
and the wish to maintain a sense of security and stability within that 
household.<BR>(iv) Going against the child큦 wishes must involve indications 
that the child may change his view by preparation for contact or eg earlier good 
attachment, arrangements by non-resident parent to help the child to overcome 
his resistance, ambivalence in the views expressed by the child about the 
parent.<BR>Consideration should be given to the effects on the child of making a 
decision that appears to disregard their feelings and wishes and when the child 
is forced to do something if he cannot see the sense of it. <BR>The psychiatric 
report looked at the absence of a bond between child and non-resident parent and 
indicated the need to take into account the age and development of the child and 
whether there was an established history of domestic violence. In such a case it 
was suggested there would need to be good reason to embark on a plan of 
introducing direct contact and building up a relationship where the main 
evidence was of the non-resident parent큦 capacity for violence within 
relationships.</P>
<P><BR><B>No direct contact</B><BR>Dr Sturge and Dr Glaser considered the 
question in what circumstances should the court give consideration to a child 
having no direct contact with the non-resident parent. In their view there 
should be no automatic assumption that contact to a previously or currently 
violent parent was in the child큦 interests, if anything the assumption should 
be in the opposite direction and he should prove why he can offer something of 
benefit to the child and to the child큦 situation. They said</P>
<P>"Domestic violence involves a very serious and significant failure in 
parenting - failure to protect the child큦 carer and failure to protect the 
child emotionally (and in some cases physically - which meets any definition of 
child abuse.)<BR>Without the following we would see the balance of advantage and 
disadvantage as tipping against contact:<BR>(a) some (preferably full) 
acknowledgment of the violence;<BR>(b) some acceptance (preferably full if 
appropriate i.e. the sole instigator of violence) of responsibility for that 
violence;<BR>(c) full acceptance of the inappropriateness of the violence 
particularly in respect of the domestic and parenting context and of the likely 
ill effects on the child;<BR>(d) a genuine interest in the child큦 welfare and 
full commitment to the child i.e. a wish for contact in which he is not making 
the conditions;<BR>(e) a wish to make reparation to the child and work towards 
the child recognising the inappropriateness of the violence and the attitude to 
and treatment of the mother and helping the child to develop appropriate values 
and attitudes;<BR>(f) an expression of regret and the showing of some 
understanding of the impact of their behaviour on the ex-partner in the past and 
currently;<BR>(g) indications that the parent seeking contact can reliably 
sustain contact in all senses."</P>
<P>They suggested that without a - f above they could not see how the 
non-resident parent could fully support the child and play a part in undoing the 
harm caused to the child and support the child큦 current situation and need to 
move on and develop healthily. There would be a significant risk to the child큦 
general well-being and his emotional development.</P>
<P>"Without these we also see contact as potentially raising the likelihood of 
the most serious of the sequelae of children큦 exposure, directly or indirectly, 
to domestic violence, namely the increased risk of aggression and violence in 
the child generally, the increased risk of the child becoming the perpetrator of 
domestic violence or becoming involved in domestically violent relationships and 
of increased risk of having disturbed interpersonal relationships 
themselves."</P>
<P>They added to the list <BR>(h) respecting the child큦 wishes:</P>
<P>" whilst this needs to be assessed within the whole context of such wishes, 
the older the child the more seriously they should be viewed and the more 
insulting and discrediting to the child to have them ignored. As a rough rule we 
would see these as needing to be taken account of at any age: above 10 we see 
these as carrying considerable weight with 6-10 as an intermediate stage and at 
under 6 as often indistinguishable in many ways from the wishes of the main 
carer (assuming normal development). In domestic violence, where the child has 
memories of that violence we would see their wishes as warranting much more 
weight than in situations where no real reason for the child큦 resistance 
appears to exist." </P>
<P>In addition to the above, other evaluations of how the contact would benefit 
the child would need to be made. The purpose of contact needed to be answered, 
whether it was designed to provide information and direct knowledge of the 
non-resident parent or to continue or develop a meaningful father-child 
relationship. </P>
<P><BR><B>Disadvantages of no direct contact</B><BR>They looked at the potential 
detriment to the child of having no direct contact with the <U>non-</U>resident 
parent in the context of past domestic violence. The most relevant issues were 
<BR>(i) deprivation of a relationship with the biological father;<BR>(ii) loss 
of opportunity to know the parent at first hand with the loss of information and 
knowledge that will go towards the child큦 formation of identity and<U> </U>not 
to know the reality of the parent which may be less worrying than the unseen, 
imagined villain. If the contact is positive it may help the child to have a 
more positive image of himself or herself and a better attitude to future 
parenting.<BR>(iii) loss of opportunity to know grandparents and other relatives 
of that parent with the potential loss of genealogical information. Sometimes 
there can be successful contact with the family even if not with the 
non-resident parent.<BR>(iv) loss of the parent with whom there has been a good 
relationship or a relationship that has given the child some sense of being 
cared about. Continuity can be important.<BR>(v) if a parent is able to provide 
positive and supportive contact and new and different experiences, then loss of 
that opportunity.<BR>(vi) Absence of opportunity for any repair to the 
relationships or to the harm done.<BR>(vii) lessening of the likelihood of the 
child being able to get in touch and/or form a relationship at a later 
stage.<BR>They also suggested that there should be greater creativity in 
addressing ways of resolving contact difficulties. An example given was by 
seeing the parent in a safe situation where the child was in control such as, by 
using a one way screen with an interviewer interviewing the parent on the other 
side. The child could decide if he wished to enter the room to see the parent. 
Proxy contact was suggested with a trained go-between and supervisors to support 
the child at the contact sessions. <BR>The general advice and the specific 
advice on contact in cases of domestic violence from the two distinguished 
consultant child psychiatrists which I have summarised above is informed by 
research and also by the responses to the Consultation Paper provided by the 
Sub-Committee. In my view it is extremely valuable information to assist in the 
difficult task faced by the family judge or family proceedings magistrates 
deciding whether to order contact in cases where domestic violence is proved. 
<BR><B>General Comments</B><BR>There are however a number of general comments I 
wish to make on the advice given to us. The family judges and magistrates need 
to have a heightened awareness of the existence of and consequences, (some 
long-term), on children of exposure to domestic violence between their parents 
or other partners. There has, perhaps, been a tendency in the past for courts 
not to tackle allegations of violence and to leave them in the background on the 
premise that they were matters affecting the adults and not relevant to issues 
regarding the children. The general principle that contact with the non-resident 
parent is in the interests of the child may sometimes have discouraged 
sufficient attention being paid to the adverse effects on children living in the 
household where violence has occurred. It may not necessarily be widely 
appreciated that violence to a partner involves a significant failure in 
parenting - failure to protect the child큦 carer and failure to protect the 
child emotionally. <BR>In a contact or other section 8 application, where 
allegations of domestic violence are made which might have an effect on the 
outcome, those allegations must be adjudicated upon and found proved or not 
proved. It will be necessary to scrutinise such allegations which may not always 
be true or may be grossly exaggerated. If however there is a firm basis for 
finding that violence has occurred, the psychiatric advice becomes very 
important. There is not, however, nor should there be, any presumption that, on 
proof of domestic violence, the offending parent has to surmount a prima facie 
barrier of no contact. As a matter of principle, domestic violence of itself 
cannot constitute a bar to contact. It is one factor in the difficult and 
delicate balancing exercise of discretion. The court deals with the facts of a 
specific case in which the degree of violence and the seriousness of the impact 
on the child and on the resident parent have to be taken into account. In cases 
of proved domestic violence, as in cases of other proved harm or risk of harm to 
the child, the court has the task of weighing in the balance the seriousness of 
the domestic violence, the risks involved and the impact on the child against 
the positive factors, (if any), of contact between the parent found to have been 
violent and the child. In this context, the ability of the offending parent to 
recognise his past conduct, be aware of the need to change and make genuine 
efforts to do so, will be likely to be an important consideration. Wall J in 
<B><CITE>re M (Contact: Violent Parent)</CITE></B> [1999] 2 FLR 321 suggested at 
page 333 that often in cases where domestic violence had been found, too little 
weight had been given to the need for the father to change. He suggested that 
the father should demonstrate that he was a fit person to exercise contact and 
should show a track record of proper behaviour. Assertions, without evidence to 
back it up, may well not be sufficient.<BR>In expressing these views I recognise 
the danger of the pendulum swinging too far against contact where domestic 
violence has been proved. It is trite but true to say that no two child cases 
are exactly the same. The court always has the duty to apply section 1 of the 
Children Act that the welfare of the child is paramount and, in considering that 
welfare, to take into account all the relevant circumstances, including the 
advice of the medical experts as far as it is relevant and proportionate to the 
decision in that case. It will also be relevant in due course to take into 
account the impact of Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights on a decision 
to refuse direct contact. <BR>The propositions set out above are not, in my 
view, in any way inconsistent with earlier decisions on contact. The fostering 
of a relationship between the child and the non-resident parent has always been 
and remains of great importance. It has equally been intended to be for the 
benefit of the child rather than of the parent. Over the last 40 years there has 
been a movement away from rights towards responsibilities of the parents and 
best interests of the child. In <B><CITE>re M (Contact: Welfare Test)</CITE></B> 
[1995] 1 FLR 274, Wilson J, referring to the general principles on contact laid 
down in <B><CITE>re H</CITE></B> [1992] 1 FLR 148, (and which were endorsed in 
<B><CITE>re O</CITE></B><I> </I>(below)) said</P>
<P>"I personally find it helpful to cast the principles into the framework of 
the checklist of considerations set out in <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 1</A>(3) 
of the <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children 
Act</A> <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">1989</A> and 
to ask whether the fundamental emotional need of every child to have an enduring 
relationship with both his parents (s1(3)(b) is outweighed by the depth of harm 
which, in the light, inter alia, of his wishes and feelings (s1(3)(a) this child 
would be at risk of suffering (s1(3)(e) by virtue of a contact order."<BR>I find 
that a helpful summary of the proper approach to a contact application where 
domestic violence is a factor. </P>
<P><BR>In the decision in <B><CITE>re O</CITE><U> </U><CITE>(Contact: Imposition 
of Conditions)</CITE></B>[1995] 2 FLR 124, Sir Thomas Bingham MR reviewed the 
leading authorities on contact and restated the main principles with which I 
respectfully agree. In that case an intransigent mother refused the father 
contact to his child aged 2. Although there was a non-molestation order breached 
by the father who received a short suspended sentence for contempt, it was not a 
case of domestic violence. Sir Thomas Bingham said at page 128<BR>"First of all, 
and overriding all else as provided in s1(1) of the 1989 Act, the welfare of the 
child is the paramount consideration of any court concerned to make an order 
relating to the upbringing of a child. It cannot be emphasised too strongly that 
the court is concerned with the interests of the mother and the father only 
insofar as they bear on the welfare of the child.<BR>Secondly, where parents of 
a child are separated and the child is in the day to day care of one of them, it 
is almost always in the interests of the child that he or she should have 
contact with the other parent. The reason for this scarcely needs spelling out. 
It is, of course, that the separation of parents involves a loss to the child, 
and it is desirable that that loss should so far as possible be made good by 
contact with the non-custodial parent, that is the parent in whose day to day 
care the child is not."<BR>He said at page 129<BR>"Cases do, unhappily and 
infrequently but occasionally, arise in which a court is compelled to conclude 
that in the existing circumstances an order for immediate direct contact should 
not be ordered, because so to order would injure the welfare of the 
child."<BR>This passage was followed by a quotation from Waite LJ in <B><CITE>re 
D (A Minor)(Contact: Mother큦 Hostility)</CITE></B> [1993] 2 FLR 1. The Master 
of the Rolls then said at page 129<BR>"The courts should not at all readily 
accept that the child큦 welfare will be injured by direct contact. Judging that 
question the court should take a medium and long-term view of the child큦 
development and not accord excessive weight to what appear likely to be 
short-term or transient problems. Neither parent should be encouraged or 
permitted to think that the more intransigent, the more unreasonable, the more 
obdurate and the more unco-operative they are, the more likely they are to get 
their own way."<BR>With all those observations I respectfully agree, but it is 
clear that the Master of the Rolls was considering the risk of emotional harm to 
the child from the implacability hostility of the mother to contact and not to 
the entirely different circumstances of domestic violence proved against the 
parent seeking contact. The issues with which we are concerned in these appeals 
relate to violence or threats of violence that have been proved, where the fears 
of the resident parent are reasonable and where serious issues arise as to the 
risks of emotional harm to the children, a far cry from the unreasonable 
implacable hostility cases, (see also <B><CITE>re D (Contact: Reasons for 
Refusal)</CITE></B> [1997] 2 FLR 48. <BR>In conclusion, on the general issues, a 
court hearing a contact application</P>
<P>in which allegations of domestic violence are raised, should consider the 
conduct of both parties towards each other and towards the children, the effect 
on the children and on the residential parent and the motivation of the parent 
seeking contact. Is it a desire to promote the best interests of the child or a 
means to continue violence and/or intimidation or harassment of the other 
parent? In cases of serious domestic violence, the ability of the offending 
parent to recognise his or her past conduct, to be aware of the need for change 
and to make genuine efforts to do so, will be likely to be an important 
consideration.<BR>On an application for interim contact, when the allegations of 
domestic violence have not yet been adjudicated upon, the court should give 
particular consideration to the likely risk of harm to the child, whether 
physical or emotional, if contact is granted or refused. The court should 
ensure, as far as it can, that any risk of harm to the child is minimised the 
safety of the child and the residential parent is secured before, during and 
after any such contact.</P>
<P><BR>I turn now to the first appeal. <BR><B>Appeal in re L</B> <BR>The child T 
is a little girl born on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> June 1998 and is still under two 
years old. She lives with her mother. The parents did not marry or cohabit. The 
father was and remains married with a child by that marriage. T was registered 
in the father큦 name but is now known by her mother큦 name. There is no issue on 
the change of name. Contact ceased soon after the birth of the child. The father 
applied for a parental responsibility order and contact to the child. The 
applications came before His Honour Judge Allweis on the 29th September 1999. He 
heard evidence of violence alleged by the mother both before and during the 
latter part of her pregnancy which included slapping, hitting her with an 
umbrella and trying to strangle her which caused bruising to her neck. An 
incident occurred when the baby was four weeks old. She was sitting naked on the 
bed feeding the child. The father pulled her hair and using foul language 
threatened to cut it off with scissors he was holding. He then cut off her pubic 
hair with the scissors. She was in tears and felt shaken, scared and degraded. 
She decided to leave him and did so three weeks later. On that occasion he 
collected her from her mother큦 home. She told him she wanted to stay with her 
mother because the child had colic. She locked herself into the bathroom and he 
kicked the door open and grabbed her and the baby in her baby seat so she felt 
she had to go with him. The next day she went to the police. She then received 
threatening telephone calls including threats to remove T. The police went to 
the mother큦 home on the 19<SUP>th</SUP> August 1998 which they found had been 
vandalised and rendered uninhabitable. The father completely denied the violence 
and the vandalism of the mother큦 home. He continued to deny the violence at the 
contact hearing and on appeal. The judge gave judgment on the 4<SUP>th</SUP> 
October 1999 and said that the allegations amounted to a catalogue of sadistic 
violence. He found the mother큦 account of violence to be true. He 
said<BR>"....this is a man who has mood swings and a temper....<BR>I would add 
this: that a father who systematically went through and damaged partner큦 home, 
as he did, has a very real anger and control problem. It indicates a cruel 
streak, which suggests a significant psychological problem...."</P>
<P>He then considered the mother큦 opposition to contact. </P>
<P>"I conclude that the mother큦 opposition to contact is implacable but 
reasonable. Her fear is genuine and based on rational grounds, namely actual 
violence and a genuine fear of him, and that T will in time witness 
violence.<BR>I believe that direct contact, if ordered, would trigger enormous 
anxiety which would affect the mother. ....The mother큦 attitude towards contact 
would put T at serious risk of major emotional harm if she were to be compelled 
to accept a degree of contact to the father against her will, and indeed in time 
that heightened anxiety would be conveyed to the child....."<BR></P>
<P>He made a residence order to the mother. He ordered indirect contact and made 
a family assistance order to help set up the indirect contact and<BR>dismissed 
the father큦 application for a parental responsibility order and granted 
permission to appeal. The father appeals to this Court on both issues and raises 
<B><I>Articles 8</I></B> and <B><I>14</I></B> of the <B><I>European Convention 
on Human Rights.</I></B><BR>On the issue of contact, the judge found the 
mother큦 opposition to contact to be reasonable and that her fear of him was 
genuine and based on actual violence and that T would in time witness violence. 
In the light of the findings of the judge of serious violence by the father 
including a catalogue of sadistic violence, that he had a very real anger and 
control problem, and the denial by the father of the facts found by the judge, 
the judge큦 decision not to grant direct contact was entirely in line with the 
clear advice in the psychiatric report provided to this court. The judge 
said<BR>"....it might be a good idea for him to look in a mirror and begin to 
accept what he is and what his role has been in the mother큦 life and during her 
pregnancy with T and subsequent to her birth. The sooner he comes to terms with 
the fear he has caused and the long-term emotional scars he has caused, the 
better."<BR><BR>The risks to the child were obvious and the father, in refusing 
to face up to them, was clearly unable to reduce those risks. In her able 
submissions to the Court, Miss de Haas QC, on behalf of the father, made the 
point that the mother was white and the father was black and, since the child 
was of mixed race, she needed to understand her roots and establish her 
identity, which would best be achieved by direct contact. In the circumstances 
of this case, in my view, it would certainly be possible to achieve that 
important objective by indirect contact. The judge applied the proper principles 
and the decision to which he came was not only well within his exercise of 
discretion, but on the facts of this case, clearly right.<BR>Although a decision 
on the point is not yet strictly relevant, there was no failure, in my view, by 
the judge, under <B><I>Article 8(1)</I></B><I>,</I> to have proper respect for 
family life. <B><I>Article 8(2)</I></B> provides the crucial protection for the 
child T who also has rights and interests under the <B><I>Convention</I></B>, 
(see <B><CITE>Marckx v Belgium</CITE></B> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/2.html">(1979) 2 EHRR 330</a>; <B><CITE>Hokkanen v 
Finland</CITE></B> (1994) 19 EHRR 139). In <B><I>Hendriks v Netherlands</I></B> 
(1982) 5 EHRR 223 the Court held that where there was a serious conflict between 
the interests of a child and one of its parents which could only be resolved to 
the disadvantage of one of them, the interests of the child had to prevail under 
Article 8(2). The principle of the crucial importance of the best interests of 
the child has been upheld in all subsequent decisions of the European Court of 
Human Rights. The observation by the Court in <B><CITE>Johansen v 
Norway</CITE></B><I> </I>(1996) 23 EHRR 33 is particularly apposite to this 
appeal. The court said<BR>"In particular.....the parent cannot be entitled under 
<I>Article 8</I> of the <I>Convention </I>to have such measures taken as would 
harm the child큦 health and development."<BR><BR>In the present appeal, there 
are very real risks of emotional harm that require the court to protect the 
child. I would dismiss the appeal on the issue of contact.<BR>With regard to a 
parental responsibility order, this court laid down general principles in 
<B><CITE>re H (Illegitimate Children: Father: Parental Rights: Number 
2)</CITE></B> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/5.html">[1991] 1</a> FLR 214, in the judgment of Balcombe LJ. He said at page 
218</P>
<P>"the court will have to take into account a number of factors, of which the 
following will undoubtedly be material (although there may well be others, as 
the list is not intended to be exhaustive):<BR>1. the degree of commitment which 
the father has shown towards the child;<BR>2. the degree of attachment which 
exists between the father and the child;<BR>3. the reasons of the father for 
applying for the order."<BR>The judge accepted the submissions of counsel that, 
against the background of no contact, the father was in an impossible position 
in relation to the first two factors. He made, however, clear findings adverse 
to the father in respect of the third factor. He considered that there were 
worrying features in the case. He concluded that the father wanted to control 
the mother and <BR>"seeks an order, indeed orders, to control, and because they 
are his right rather than because he is committed to T and wants to do his best 
for her and give her the best. I am sure he regards the mother큦 defiance of 
him, and refusal to bow to his wishes, humiliating and frustrating. I do not 
believe it would be right or in T큦 interests for him to have parental 
responsibility <U>at this stage. </U>I stress those last three words. I would be 
prepared to look at the matter afresh, in the light of his commitment to 
indirect contact and, indeed his response to this judgment and acceptance 
perhaps that he is a violent man who has put the mother in fear.<BR>I do not 
believe that he has shown genuine concern. For him I believe it is a question of 
his rights and a right to control, rather than commitment to or concern for 
T."</P>
<P>Miss de Haas suggested that the judge had linked the two applications of 
contact and parental responsibility together and did not give proper 
consideration to the status of parental responsibility nor to the principles 
governing it. In my judgment that submission is misconceived. The judge gave 
careful and separate consideration to the question of parental responsibility 
and I can find no error in his approach. In the light of the findings of the 
judge, I can see no ground for criticising his exercise of discretion. I would 
dismiss the appeal against the refusal to make a parental responsibility 
order.<BR>The second appeal.</P>
<P><B>Appeal in re V</B><BR>The child J is a boy born on the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> 
November 1990 and is now 9 years old. He lives with his mother. The parents were 
married in South Africa in 1988 and moved to England in 1991. J was born here 
while the parents were cohabiting. They finally separated in April 1994 after a 
history of turbulence and violence by the father. Contact ceased in December 
1994 after J witnessed a serious incident when the father attacked the mother in 
the kitchen with a knife and caused an injury to her finger which bled 
profusely. The father was tried and pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily 
harm, and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment. After his release in June 
1995 the father sought contact with the child which was refused. He applied for 
a contact order in January 1996. He began a course of counselling in anger 
management in October 1997. On the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> February 1998 His Honour Judge 
Bishop made an interim order for indirect contact with a review in July 1998 at 
which the indirect contact order was continued with a review in 1999. On the 
4<SUP>th</SUP> June 1999 the matter was adjourned for the court welfare officer 
to see the child and on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> June the judge made a further order 
for indirect contact which is the subject of this appeal. Permission to appeal 
was granted by Thorpe LJ.<BR>In his judgments of the 4<SUP>th</SUP> and 
25<SUP>th</SUP> June the judge found that over the year the father had applied 
himself assiduously to changing his personality and to demonstrating that he was 
in a fit state and was a fit person to see J face to face and to have contact 
with him. The judge said<BR>"I have to say that all the signs are that he has 
achieved that purpose. Dr Brenner has made a report in which he indicates that 
there has been a big change. Father is able to control temper, he is a much 
calmer person."<BR>The father was continuing to undergo counselling from an 
expert in anger management. The father was a changed person and the mother 
accepted that he was. She and her new husband did not object to contact. The 
judge was satisfied that he was now suitable to renew contact with J. The father 
had written J suitable letters on a regular basis, but J would not read them and 
the court welfare officer was unable to persuade him to do so. When Dr Baker 
gave evidence the previous year he had described J as a robust boy, with a 
strong enough personality to be able to cope with face to face contact. He, his 
mother, his stepfather and the small daughter were a solid and secure unit. The 
court welfare officer however who had seen the boy regularly said in his report 
of the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> March 1999 that<BR>"It has proved extremely difficult to 
engage J in discussion about the letters from his father, the link with South 
Africa or anything else for that matter as there appeared to be an impenetrable 
barrier over this aspect of his background."<BR>In his report of the 
21<SUP>st</SUP> June, having seen the child twice in that month the court 
welfare officer recorded his efforts and those of the step-father to interest 
the child in letters from his father without any success. There was outright 
rejection of the idea of direct contact with his father. In his conclusions he 
said that the school told him that<BR>"J never mentions his natural father, in 
spite of indirect exposure to [father] these past few years.....In spite of 
tangible efforts by [the mother and step-father], J has not shifted his position 
and he shows not one iota of interest in a direct meeting with his 
father."<BR>The judge reminded himself that five years before the boy had 
witnessed the attack on his mother with a knife. The mother told the judge that 
she accepted contact but argued that it was not yet the right time for it to 
start again. She said that the child showed considerable distress when the 
hearings were taking place, including bed-wetting. They would encourage contact 
if J asked for it and accepted it would be good for him. The judge decided to 
trust the mother and stepfather to encourage J towards contact in preference to 
imposing a contact arrangement which might require forcing the child with 
consequential upheaval and upset. His order for indirect contact included the 
possibility of direct contact with the agreement of the parties. <BR>The mother 
sought to adduce additional evidence on two issues, the first the mother큦 state 
of health including a report from her psychiatrist. The second set out the 
paucity of the indirect contact between the father and the child between hearing 
and appeal. At the request of the Court the father signed a short statement 
setting out his version of the extent of the indirect contact. We looked at the 
additional evidence from both sides but I have come to a clear conclusion on the 
basis of the evidence before the judge, without taking into account any of the 
additional evidence.<BR>This case demonstrates a real effort by the father to 
recognise and come to terms with the serious violence that he had caused the 
mother. The mother and her new husband have in principle accepted that change of 
heart by the father. They were prepared to support contact to the father. The 
difficulty lay in the child himself, clearly seen from the most recent reports 
of the court welfare officer. In the report of Dr Sturge and Dr Glaser, the 
advice was that a child refusing to see a parent must be listened to and taken 
seriously. This boy had not seen his father since he was 4 and at the hearing he 
was nearly 9. His last recollection of his father was the serious assault on his 
mother with a knife and her hand covered in blood. We are reminded by the 
psychiatric report that, even when children do not continue in a violent 
situation, emotional trauma continues to be experienced. This child showed 
considerable distress during the proceedings including bed-wetting. He would not 
talk about his father or look at his letters. The judge, faced with these 
problems did not rule out direct contact in the future. He trusted the mother 
and step-father and decided to go at their pace and not at the pace of the 
father. He left it to them to encourage contact at a suitable point and to lead 
the child to it. This approach is endorsed by Dr Sturge and Dr Glaser in their 
report. <BR>When I first looked at the papers on this appeal, I have to say that 
the refusal of direct contact by the judge gave me pause for thought. The 
Official Solicitor supported some direct contact. However, having heard argument 
and considered the additional evidence from the psychiatric report by Dr Sturge 
and Dr Glaser, I have come to the conclusion that the judge큦 order cannot be 
disturbed. In my view, the judge approached this case with the greatest care and 
sensitivity and came to a cautious decision with the best interests of the child 
uppermost in his mind. It was a difficult and delicate balance and it would be 
entirely inappropriate for this court to interfere with that exercise of 
discretion. The more difficult the decision to be made, the more difficult it is 
for the appellate court to interfere with the exercise of discretion vested in 
the judge. The father is to be commended for his great efforts to improve his 
conduct but contact cannot be seen as a reward for that endeavour. Contact has 
to be in the best interests of his son. I would dismiss the appeal. <BR>It is 
not therefore necessary to consider the effect of the additional evidence 
adduced by both parties. I shall however set it out shortly because it may be 
relevant in any future application by the father. The mother was found by the 
judge in July to be sufficiently robust to cope with the introduction of 
contact. In September the mother had a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as 
suffering from clinical depression. The causes of the depression and breakdown 
may need, at some future stage, to be investigated. But in any event, it 
discloses that the mother큦 state of health is more fragile than the judge 
considered it to be. The other point that came out from the additional evidence 
was that, from the father큦 statement, there was a very limited take-up of 
indirect contact by him, a letter at the end of June, a postcard during December 
or early January and a letter in mid-March 2000. There was no communication at 
or over the Christmas period. There would clearly be a need to look at the 
reasons for this apparent failure of communication. If this Court had been 
minded to accept the additional evidence, it would have been appropriate in this 
difficult case to remit it to the judge for him to consider the accuracy of and 
the weight to be attached to that evidence. If there is a further application or 
the judge conducts any review of the case, this additional evidence will no 
doubt form an important part of those proceedings.<BR>The third 
appeal<BR><B>Appeal in re M</B> <BR><B>T</B>he child G is a boy born on the 
24<SUP>th</SUP> January 1991 and is now 9 years old. He lives with his mother. 
The parents married in March 1987. The marriage was not happy and the mother 
obtained an injunction against the father based upon his violence towards her. 
He was charged with grievous bodily harm but the criminal proceedings were not 
pursued. The mother obtained an ouster order. The judge found that the father 
큧rashed the house when he left under the order. The child was born after they 
separated and initially the father denied paternity, but it was established in 
March 1992. When the child was 18 months he saw his father on a regular 
fortnightly basis in a contact centre in the presence of his mother. This form 
of contact lasted until November 1997, a period of over five years. No effort 
was made to move the contact on from supervision by the mother in the contact 
centre. The contact came to an end after an argument between the parents in 
front of G who subsequently said that he did not want to see his father. The 
mother remarried in July 1997 and has a child by that marriage, born in August 
1998. The father started proceedings in February 1998. Attempts were made to 
restart contact. The child was taken to the contact centre but he refused to see 
his father. By the date of the hearing the boy had not seen his father for 2 
years. <BR>The application for contact came before His Honour Judge Rudd on the 
2<SUP>nd</SUP> September 1999 and he gave a written judgment on the 
8<SUP>th</SUP> October 1999. In it he set out the unfortunate procedural history 
of the case in that it had been variously before a deputy district judge, a 
recorder and three different circuit judges. One effect of that history, 
relating to the direction given in respect of the evidence of the court welfare 
officer, formed part of the submissions on appeal to which I shall refer later. 
The judge refused an order for direct contact and ordered indirect contact by 
letters, cards and Christmas and birthday presents. He refused permission to 
appeal, which we granted.</P>
<P>Although there was a background of violence during the marriage and it 
remains a factor which, the judge found, had left its mark on the mother, unlike 
the other appeals before us, violence does not appear to me to be the main cause 
of the refusal of contact by the mother. The judge formed the view that the 
source of the problem was the long period of contact at the contact centre and 
that the matter should have been tackled years before. It would seem that for, a 
normal boy, the contact over the years in the contact centre must have lacked 
stimulus and interest and the relationship between the father and son does not 
appear to have had an opportunity to blossom and develop. In the psychiatric 
report, unstimulating experiences which were lacking in interest, fun or in 
extending the child and his experiences, were included among the risks of direct 
contact with the non-resident parent.</P>
<P><BR>The main issues on the appeal were the conclusions of the judge on the 
attitude of the mother, the approach of the judge to the problems associated 
with the court welfare officer and to the evidence of a jointly instructed 
forensic psychologist, Dr Lowenstein.<BR>I shall deal first with the evidence of 
the court welfare officer. At an earlier hearing she was directed to provide a 
report. She produced a report dated the 12<SUP>th</SUP> November 1998 in which 
she recommended a phased reintroduction of contact. The attempts at contact 
broke down and she wrote a further report in which she expressed the view that G 
had suffered serious emotional abuse in the breakdown of contact and she was 
very critical of the mother. The mother made a complaint about the court welfare 
officer that was investigated and in part upheld. The court welfare officer then 
declined to attend the hearing and was supported in that decision by the 
Practice Manager. At an earlier hearing another judge giving directions was told 
of her refusal to attend court and give evidence and he directed that another 
court welfare officer should attend and present the report. She came before 
Judge Rudd with no knowledge of the family and was unable to give any direct 
evidence about the family. Judge Rudd, entirely justifiably in my view, was very 
critical of the refusal of the court welfare officer who wrote the report to 
attend and give evidence. I entirely agree with him that it is not up to her to 
decide if she would or would not give evidence. Her duty was to give evidence to 
the court if called upon to do so. Her failure to comply with best practice in 
compiling the report may cast doubt on its value. It does not excuse her refusal 
to assist the court. Judge Rudd was placed in a very difficult position. Another 
judge had made an unfortunate order. There was no point in the second court 
welfare officer attending court. She was wasting her time and that of the court. 
The judge giving directions should have grasped the nettle and either directed 
that there would not be a report at all for the court or another court welfare 
officer would be directed to start again and provide a fresh report. <BR>A 
particular problem for Judge Rudd was the bald statement made by the court 
welfare officer that the child had suffered emotional harm without providing any 
evidence to support it. The report was obviously controversial but the father 
relied upon it. The two alternatives, in my view, at that stage, were either to 
order the court welfare officer to attend for cross-examination or to refuse to 
admit it as evidence. The judge, unfortunately, fell between two stools by 
accepting the report as evidence and then rejecting it without hearing the maker 
of the report give oral evidence. This was a decision that the appellant father 
was entitled to criticise. I do not consider however that the judge큦 error 
advanced the father큦 case, since the judge equally was not entitled to rely 
upon the report, untested by cross-examination, when it was challenged by the 
mother. I hope that this most unusual incident with a court welfare officer will 
never again occur. I have great sympathy with the judge in his predicament in a 
difficult case where he was entitled to expect help from the court welfare 
service.<BR>The solicitors for the parties agreed that they should jointly 
instruct a child psychiatrist to advise on contact and His Honour Judge Milligan 
made the order. It appears that the parties solicitors had great difficulty in 
finding a child psychiatrist and eventually instructed Dr Lowenstein who made a 
report. He saw both parents and G and came to the conclusion that this was a 
typical case of parental alienation syndrome. As the judge said, Dr Lowenstein 
has been closely associated with recognition of this syndrome. He recommended 
therapy, at least 6 sessions to be conducted by himself, followed by a further 
report. Since it was therapy, there would be problems in financing the therapy 
and subsequent report. The judge did not accept the unsubstantiated assertion of 
the court welfare officer as to emotional abuse of G. He was equally unhappy 
about the findings and conclusions of Dr Lowenstein. In the report of Dr Sturge 
and Dr Glaser, they indicated that parental alienation syndrome was not 
recognised in either the American classification of mental disorders or the 
international classification of disorders. It is not generally recognised in 
psychiatric or allied child mental health specialities. It would be fair to say 
that Dr Lowenstein is at one end of a broad spectrum of mental health 
practitioners and that the existence of parental alienation syndrome is not 
universally accepted. There is, of course, no doubt that some parents, 
particularly mothers, are responsible for alienating their children from their 
fathers without good reason and thereby creating this sometimes insoluble 
problem. That unhappy state of affairs, well known in the family courts, is a 
long way from a recognised syndrome requiring mental health professionals to 
play an expert role. I am aware of the difficulties experienced in some areas in 
getting the appropriate medical or allied mental health expert to provide a 
report within a reasonable time. It was, however, unfortunate that the parents 
lawyers not only did not get the medical expert ordered by the judge, that is to 
say, a child psychiatrist, (although in many cases a psychologist would be 
appropriate), but, more serious, were unable to find an expert in the main 
stream of mental health expertise.<BR>The judge, in my view, was entitled to 
reject the report and the oral evidence of Dr Lowenstein, even though the 
psychologist was jointly instructed. Lord Goff of Chieveley said in <B><CITE>re 
F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation)</CITE></B> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/1.html">[1990] 2 AC1</a> at page 80 that 
experts were to be listened to with respect but their opinions must be weighed 
and judged by the court. The judge said <BR>"I cannot accept the effect of what 
Dr Lowenstein has told me, namely that PAS is such a serious state that the 
child involved and the parent should be subjected to treatment by way of therapy 
with direct threats to the mother in the event of non-co-operation. It appears 
from the literature that some schools of PAS thought advocate the immediate 
removal of the child from the alienating parent and thereafter no contact with 
the alienating parent for a period. It also appears that 큞ong term psycho- 
analytically informed therapy in the order of years rather than months is the 
treatment of choice."<BR><BR>I do not accept the submission of Mr Bates that the 
judge did not give reasons for rejecting the evidence of Dr Lowenstein. The case 
for the father was largely based upon the suspect conclusions of the court 
welfare officer of emotional harm suffered by the child. The judge did give 
reasons and it was well within his judicial function not to accept that 
evidence. <BR>The main ground of appeal was the judge큦 error in concluding that 
the mother was not hostile to contact. The judge found that the father genuinely 
wanted to re-establish and continue a relationship with his son. The judge also 
found that the mother was unenthusiastic about contact but that she had kept it 
going for 5 years. He found her to be a credible witness and he accepted her 
evidence. He accepted that she did not consciously and directly attempt to 
persuade G not to have contact. The judge said<BR>"Given a long period of 
unsatisfactory contact at the contact centre, the unsatisfactory relationship 
which [the mother] had with [the father], and her present and satisfactory 
family circumstances, I am not surprised that G has come to the conclusion that 
contact with his natural father is something of an intrusion into his life. The 
row between them in his presence was the final straw for him and probably for 
mother as well."<BR></P>
<P>The judge having rejected the evidence of the court welfare officer and of Dr 
Lowenstein, there was no evidence of serious harm to the child from the 
cessation of contact. The judge did not consider the mother to be a hostile 
mother nor one who would refuse to obey court orders. But she did not feel able 
to put pressure on the child nor force him to see his father. She would 
facilitate contact if he wanted it. The judge was not prepared to put pressure 
on the mother and could not conceive that he would commit her for contempt if an 
order for contact were not complied with. It was not a case for coercion or 
punishment. He directed himself that contact was the right of the child and the 
mother had no right to prevent contact between the child and his father. But in 
order to effect contact it would be necessary to subject the child to therapy 
recommended by Dr Lowenstein and that would require the co-operation of the 
mother. She was not prepared to take part in therapy and would not consent to 
the child taking part. The judge said that he would be extremely reluctant to 
compel a child of 8 to submit to therapy by a psychiatrist, (in fact a 
psychologist) against the wishes of his mother unless his interests had been 
represented in the case by the Official Solicitor. There was no evidence before 
him that the boy was other than a normal healthy boy with no requirement for 
psychiatric intervention save, allegedly, for the issue of contact. If he were 
forced to see his father at this stage it would have a detrimental effect upon 
him and his long-term relationship with his father. He concluded</P>
<P>"I must do the balancing act and exercise some common sense and 
proportionality in this case."</P>
<P>He applied the checklist in <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 1</A> of 
the <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act</A> 
and came to the conclusion that the only sensible order he could make was for 
indirect contact that he was satisfied the mother would not obstruct.<BR>Mr 
Bates, on behalf of the father, submitted that the central issue was the 
mother큦 hostility to contact and challenged the judge큦 findings that the 
mother was not hostile and obstructive to contact. That is a difficult argument 
to sustain before an appellate court that has not had the opportunity to assess 
the oral evidence. By a supplemental skeleton argument, Mr Bates did not seek 
immediate direct contact given the expressed views of G. He submitted that the 
judge fell into error in not following the recommendations of the jointly 
instructed expert witness. He submitted that the judge under-estimated the 
emotional harm already caused to G by the breakdown in contact with his father 
and positive steps should be taken to encourage G to resume contact by a short 
course of therapy or counselling. He submitted that the judge failed to use the 
powers available to him to try to re-establish a relationship between G and his 
father.<BR>For the reasons I have already set out, as well as having a general 
power to accept or reject evidence adduced before him, the judge was entitled to 
ignore the evidence of the court welfare officer and to reject that of the 
forensic psychologist. He did not accept that the child had suffered emotional 
harm and decided that the right order to make was for indirect <BR>contact. His 
reasons for refusing to order contact in a case where the child himself refused 
to see the parent were in tune with the advice given in the psychiatric report 
of Dr Sturge and Dr Glaser. A decision as to the potential effect upon a child 
of forcing the pace was well within his exercise of discretion and I can see no 
reason for this Court to interfere with his decision. I would dismiss the 
appeal.<BR>I would however like to express some sympathy for the father whose 
attempts to revive contact were found by the judge to be genuine and 
well-motivated. It may be that, if he perseveres in keeping in touch with G by 
interesting letters, postcards, cards and presents, when G is a little older he 
may express a wish to be in touch with his father. If the mother does not 
respond to that opening, she may store up for herself difficulties when the boy 
is in his teens who may then criticise her for not allowing him to be in contact 
with his father. The mother might also reflect upon the advice given by Sir 
Thomas Bingham in <B><CITE>re O</CITE></B> (above) at page 130 that, where there 
is no direct contact, it is important for a child to grow up knowing of the love 
and interest of the absent parent with whom, in due course, direct contact 
should be established. The object of indirect contact <BR>is to build up a 
relationship between the absent parent and the child.<BR>"The caring parent also 
has reciprocal obligations."<BR>In my view some response ought to be made by the 
child or at least by the mother by way of thank you for presents and response at 
least occasionally to letters and cards with information so that the father 
knows of his son큦 progress and his interests.</P>
<P><BR>The fourth appeal. <BR><B>Appeal in re H</B> <BR>There are two children 
H, a boy born on the 17<SUP>th</SUP> August 1990 and S a girl born on the 
17<SUP>th</SUP> July 1992 who live with the mother. The mother had an English 
mother and Pakistani father. Her parents were divorced and her mother remarried. 
She was brought up by her mother and step-father in a relaxed household until 
her step-father died. Her father then returned to the family when she was about 
11. Thereafter she then led a circumscribed life within the strict Muslim 
tradition. She had a first arranged marriage which was dissolved within the 
year. She then had an arranged marriage with the father, a strict Muslim from 
Pakistan but resident in Germany. She lived with him in Germany and the two 
children were born there. She alleged violence by the father which appears to 
have been the result of her refusal to continue to conform to the strict 
requirements of her faith. The centre of the conflict in the last few months of 
cohabitation was her failure to keep her head covered. Actual violence was minor 
but the threats of violence were extreme. The father made repeated threats to 
kill her if she did not wear a headscarf. He threatened to cut her up into 
little pieces and put her down the lavatory. He twice threatened her with a 
knife and once that he would cut her up with an electric saw. On one occasion 
she had a prayer mat wrapped round her because she had partially removed her 
headscarf at a friend큦 home. She fled with the children to a women큦 refuge in 
Germany and from there to England in October 1995. She went to great lengths to 
prevent the father from finding out her whereabouts. She changed her name and 
the names of the children. The father divorced her on the 26<SUP>th</SUP> March 
1997 and remarried. He continues to live in Germany. Somewhat surprisingly he 
did not take any proceedings in Germany under the Hague Convention. If he had 
done so the English court would have taken steps to find the mother and children 
and, with the help of the tipstaff and the police, would have had a good chance 
of tracing them. In that event, the future welfare of the children would 
probably have been decided in a German court. The failure of the father to 
invoke the Hague Convention has had the result that the family has settled here 
and the issues over the children must now be resolved in accordance with English 
domestic law, under the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 
1989</A>.<BR>The mother is no longer a practising Muslim. The children have been 
brought up in Norwich outside the Muslim faith in a Westernised style of life 
and have not seen their father since they left Germany in October 1995. The 
father discovered their address in August 1998 and applied for defined contact 
and a prohibited steps order. The mother applied for residence and that there 
should be no contact to the father. The applications came before His Honour 
Judge Barham. On the 14<SUP>th</SUP> May 1999 he made a residence order to the 
mother about which there was no dispute. The judge made findings as to the 
violence alleged by the mother. He found that she was obviously frightened in 
describing the threats of violence and that, despite some discrepancies, she was 
telling the truth. He said<BR>"I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that 
the father did threaten violence in the way the mother describes and she is very 
frightened of him, as the welfare officer confirms. I am also satisfied that she 
fears, on reasonable grounds that he may attempt to remove the children from the 
jurisdiction."<BR>On the issue of contact the judge had a report from the court 
welfare officer in April 1999. She was hampered by not seeing the children with 
their father and was aware that, at that date, they had not seen him for over 
three years. She was impressed by the quality of parenting provided by the 
mother who was very anxious about the proceedings. The children are now known by 
English names. She felt that they would be anxious about meeting their father. 
She recognised that there might be a benefit to the children from current 
knowledge of their father, particularly in terms of their developing an 
understanding of their ethnic identity and cultural background. She was however 
concerned as to whether contact could be a happy positive experience for the 
children. For it to be happy it would require the father to accept that, 
regardless of whether it was originally right or wrong to remove the children, 
they now had a different culture and were not being brought up in the Muslim 
tradition. <BR>Having found the allegations of threats to kill proved, the judge 
summarised the three main issues, conveniently set out in the court welfare 
officer큦 report, the risk of abduction, the religious/cultural confusion or 
conflict and the severity of the effect of contact upon the mother. He set out 
the concerns of the mother, that she did not trust the father and feared he 
would abduct the children; that there was a clash of cultures between the way 
the children were being brought up and the expectations of the father as a 
strict practising Muslim; so that contact would have an adverse effect upon 
them; finally the effect on her of contact with the resulting effect upon the 
children. The judge found from the way that she gave her evidence that she was 
clearly suffering more than ordinary stress.<BR>The judge found that the father 
was an imposing, impressive man who was obviously intelligent; but that he had a 
dominant personality; he was forceful and would be frightening if roused to 
anger. He took his religion very seriously. He had strong views, a robust 
approach and was not one to compromise. The judge said that he was obviously 
very indignant at the mother큦 refusal to wear the headscarf. When the children 
became 11 or 12 he would expect them to be brought up as Muslims. The judge 
relied upon the view of the court welfare officer that the father would also 
expect to introduce his influence over their lives at that time. The judge 
said<BR>"The clear evidence is that these children are living in a western 
household. The cultural differences between their lives, their mother큦 life and 
their father큦 life is acute. It might be possible to overcome this difficulty 
if it could be handled sensitively. However, this will not happen. The welfare 
officer formed the view, which I accept, that he is not sensitive about these 
matters. His approach would be a robust one.<BR>This approach would simply 
overpower the children. Any restraint by the father is going to be temporary. He 
does not accept that the children are to be brought up in a western culture, and 
I agree with the welfare officer that if contact is to be worthwhile it has 
eventually to be unsupervised and these problems will come upon it all too 
soon.<BR>Mother fears, in my view rightly, that the influence of the father 
would simply undermine her and the family unit."<BR>The judge concluded<BR>"the 
mother is frightened of the father. She fears abduction. Her fears are 
justified. She is not going to overcome those fears in the short or medium term. 
...Even if the fears are not justified she is going to retain them and the 
welfare officer has said that if contact is to be of value the mother has got to 
be able to support it and the father has to accept the reality that the children 
are being brought up in a western culture and not undermine it. In my view, 
there is no prospect of either of these conditions taking place."<BR><BR>He 
refused the father큦 application for direct contact and ordered that there 
should be indirect contact between the children and the father. The Court of 
Appeal granted permission to appeal.<BR>I am, for my part, very concerned about 
the background to this case and the circumstances in which the English court has 
been obliged to exercise jurisdiction. The removal of the children from their 
habitual residence, Germany, was reprehensible and regrettable. The failure of 
the father to obtain a Hague Convention order and the passage of time, now 
nearly five years, has created a new situation in which the children have ceased 
to live within a traditional Muslim setting and have been brought up for a large 
part of their short lives in a non-traditional and non-religious environment. 
This Court cannot put the clock back. In order to have a genuine and fruitful 
relationship with his children this father has to take them as they are and not 
as he would wish them to be. The judge who saw and heard the witnesses, 
crucially the mother and father, made findings of fact and assessments of the 
parents that this Court cannot go behind.<BR>Miss Hassan, on behalf of the 
father, in her admirable and trenchant submissions to us, made a number of valid 
points that have to be carefully considered in this sensitive case. She raised 
the right of the children to a relationship with the father, the lack of 
knowledge of the paternal family and the potential detriment to the children of 
no contact with the father. She relied upon passages in the psychiatric report 
relating to the disadvantages of no contact. She pointed out that there was no 
acknowledgement of the father큦 letters and to leave matters in the control of 
the mother would not provide any adequate communication with the father. She 
said that it was time to move the contact forward. <BR>The most important 
questions arise in my view in the findings of substantial violence by threats, 
the mother큦 continuing fear of the father, the possibility of removal of the 
children, but more important, the mother큦 genuine fear that this might happen, 
the cultural/religious clash of perceptions and the perceived inability of the 
father to adapt to the present state of affairs. Although the father was not 
physically violent to any serious degree towards the mother, his threats of 
violence were extremely serious and were intimidating and frightening to the 
mother. She fled to a women큦 refuge to escape him. She remains to this day 
afraid of him. The description of the father by the judge, that he was imposing, 
impressive, a dominant personality and likely to be frightening if roused to 
anger, adds weight to the threats made. The cause of his anger, which no doubt 
he would consider justified, was the refusal of his wife to conform to the 
requirements of his (and her) faith. Five years on, the core of that problem has 
not disappeared. It is, rather, capable of exacerbation since the shortcomings 
of the mother, as seen by the father, have also extended to her care of the 
children. In general her care of them is excellent. From the perspective of the 
father and no doubt many others of his faith, the mother큦 upbringing of the 
children is seriously flawed and the father would wish to redress the balance at 
a suitable stage of their lives. This might sound entirely reasonable except for 
the problems that this would be likely to create for the children, as has been 
set out in the admirable and perceptive judgment of the trial judge. Here is a 
father with a forceful character and robust approach, who has been found to have 
uttered serious threats of extreme violence to his wife, who is a member of an 
active proselytising movement based in Pakistan. I am satisfied, on the facts 
found by the judge, that this father would see it as his duty to reassert the 
necessary religious and cultural influence over his children that their western 
upbringing has not and will not give them. This would be a recipe for disaster. 
The violent background to this case which precipitated the separation in 1995 is 
a crucial part of the difficult decision to which the judge came. The 
psychiatric report from Dr Sturge and Dr Glaser referred to the risk of 
undermining the stability of a child where a parent deliberately or 
inadvertently set different moral standards or standards of behaviour. I am sure 
in this case the undermining would be inadvertent but the danger would be there. 
This would be a clash of cultures in which the children would be likely to 
suffer. A balance has to be struck between the importance of providing these 
children with knowledge of their religious and cultural background and the 
substantial risks of direct contact with their father. In my judgment the 
judge큦 decision displays no error in his approach to the exercise of discretion 
and cannot be said to be wrong in principle. Indeed in my view he came to the 
right conclusion and I would dismiss the appeal.<BR>The mother however has an 
obligation to recognise that these children were born and in their early years 
brought up within the Muslim faith. They are entitled to know their origins and 
to be given appropriate knowledge of the religion of their birth. Her own family 
remains Muslim and there is available the opportunity for providing of 
information to the children that should be part of her parental responsibility. 
There should also be some indirect contact as the judge directed. I hope that 
the father will use constructively the opportunity of indirect contact with his 
children. The comments which I have made in the <U>appeal </U>of re M (above) 
about reciprocity from the children to their father also apply to this 
case.<BR><B>Lord Justice Thorpe:</B> I have had the advantage of reading in 
draft the judgment of my lady, the President, and I agree with her judgment and 
her disposal of the four appeals before the court. In relation to the individual 
cases I wish to add only two opinions. I have also had the advantage of reading 
Waller LJ's succinct summary of our essential conclusions. With that I am in 
complete agreement.<BR><B>The Individual Cases - H (Children)</B><BR>H 
(Children) is the only one of these four cases in which I doubt that I would 
have made as restrictive an order had I been the trial judge. Although there 
were intimidating and brutal threats of violence there was little actual 
violence in the history. What for me is more significant is this analysis. This 
was not a marriage of mixed cultures. Whilst the mother's attachments to Islam 
did not match the father's, she is half-Pakistani and was brought up and married 
as a Moslem. Whatever her reasons, her rejection of Islam was achieved by 
unheralded flight and the subsequent endeavour to obliterate the traces of 
flight. Had she been childless the principal person affected would have been her 
husband. But to include the children was to deprive them of their father, their 
settled home, their culture and their heritage. The decision to replace that 
with an environment and culture of Anglicised agnosticism and assimilation was 
done, of course without reference to the father, but more seriously without 
reference to any independent power or authority that might have investigated the 
proposal or the fait accompli to ensure that what met her needs was compatible 
with the welfare of her children. Of course in cases of child abduction, whether 
or not international frontiers are crossed, the parent who contemplates 
abduction, still less the parent who abducts, does not initiate such a scrutiny. 
Therefore in order to understand the eventual outcome it is in my opinion 
important to stress that at no time between the mother's flight in October 1995 
and the initiation of proceedings in October 1998 did the father exercise his 
rights to seek redress under either the Hague or the European Conventions. 
Although the whereabouts of the mother were successfully concealed he knew at 
some level that she must be in the United Kingdom, if only because of the 
improbability of her being anywhere else. Ignorance of whereabouts does not 
inhibit the initiation of well established search procedures in this 
jurisdiction. Then when he eventually discovered her whereabouts the only 
proceeding which he issued was the application for a direct contact order. 
(Whilst it is true that the application issued in the Bow County Court also 
purported to seek a prohibited step order, that order was never specified or 
pursued. Miss Hasan was unable to explain it other than to speculate that it was 
designed to achieve an order restraining the mother from a second flight.) 
Therefore all that the father sought was a supervised contact order that would 
allow him to spend only 24 out of all the hours that a year contains with his 
children and in the presence of a supervising professional. Of course in 
proceedings under the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A> 
the judge was not bound to confine his appraisal of welfare within the confines 
of the application issued, but it is understandable enough for a judge to 
hesitate to extend the bounds of an already difficult enquiry. But this was a 
mother whose determination to assimilate had extended to replacing the 
children's Moslem names and to including pork on the family menu. Where the 
unilateral action of one parent has severed children's links with their home, 
the other parent, and the culture and tradition of their birth then the first 
task of the family justice system is to investigate the possibility of restoring 
the children's loss to the extent that is realistic in the circumstances 
obtaining at the date of judgment. If they cannot be returned to their former 
home and to shared life with their parents then the least the court will 
ordinarily ensure is that the loss is mitigated by productive contact with the 
lost parent and by conditions and requirements to ensure that the parent 
providing the primary home does not use the opportunity to obliterate the 
culture and religion into which they were born and which she herself affirmed at 
marriage. It is not only Moslems who might think that the mother has 
impoverished the children's experience of childhood by the choices that she has 
made for herself.<BR>In conclusion the reason that I have expressed my 
reservations about the dismissal of the father's appeal is to emphasise that I 
regard the outcome as quite exceptional and only justified by the exceptional 
facts and circumstances. Cases in which English mothers have experienced the 
total loss of their children by paternal abduction into an Islamic society are 
much publicised. Our minimum expectation of the religious courts in the Islamic 
state is that they will ensure generous contact to the mother within the Islamic 
state. One interpretation of the outcome of the proceedings in this jurisdiction 
is that the applicant is left as bereft as any Christian applicant to a Sharia 
court. I want to make it plain that that would be a superficial and erroneous 
interpretation. I would also want to make it plain that no mother should be 
encouraged by a reading of the judgments of this court to follow Mrs H's 
example.<BR>However all that said, despite the strong and skilful submissions of 
Miss Hasan, in the end I conclude that the judge was within the broad 
discretionary ambit in deciding the case as he did.<BR><B>L (Child)</B><BR>I 
have little doubt that in granting permission to appeal Judge Allweis was aware 
of the need to obtain guidance from this court on issues raised by the public 
consultation. He can hardly have doubted his conclusions in the light of his 
findings of fact. The addition of ECHR arguments to bolster an almost impossible 
appeal on the facts may foreshadow a fashion. The judgment of the Master of the 
Rolls in <U>Daniels v Walker</U>, reported in The Times 17 May 2000 emphasises 
the need for counsel to exercise responsibility in this area. That stricture 
must be of equal if not extra application in family cases. In so saying I intend 
no criticism of Miss de Haas, who conducted this appeal with conspicuous skill 
and good sense, nor of her junior.<BR><B>Contact: Rights and 
Presumptions</B><BR>The inter-relationship between domestic violence and contact 
calls for an examination of the underlying principles upon which contact orders 
are either made or refused. Nothing specific is to be found in statute law. If 
there are principles they are judge made. Where children are in care the 
discretion of the local authority was subjected to judicial control by section 
12F(1) of the Child Care Act 1980. A more sophisticated regime was then 
introduced by the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A> 
which by <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s34.html">section 34</A> 
emphasises the duty of the local authority to promote contact by providing that, 
save in most limited circumstances, the local authority may not terminate or 
restrict contact save by order of the court or by agreement with the concerned 
adult. But in relation to private law proceedings the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A> 
makes no specific provisions in relation to contact. Where there is a dispute it 
is resolved by a largely unfettered judicial discretion. The judge must simply 
apply the welfare principle and the welfare check list. However in 1996 the 
legislation sought to introduce some definition by <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s11.html">section 
11</A>(4) of the Family Law Act which includes paragraph (c):<BR>"The general 
principle that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the welfare of the 
child will be best served by:<BR>(i) his having regular contact with those who 
have parental responsibility for him and with other members of his family; 
and<BR>(ii) the maintenance of as good a continuing relationship with his 
parents as possible;"<BR>Although this provision has been enacted it lies within 
Part II, the commencement of which has given rise to well publicised problems 
and consequential delay. Furthermore this provision would only apply to children 
whose parents are on the threshold of divorce or judicial separation.<BR>The 
language of the judges in explaining the basis of decision making in relation to 
contact has shifted over the years. In <U>S v S</U> [1962] 1 WLR 445, Wilmer LJ 
described contact as `no more than the basic right of any parent'.<BR>In <U>J v 
C</U> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/4.html">[1970] AC 668</a> Lord McDermott explained the relationship between parental 
rights and child welfare when he said at 715:<BR>"In applying section 1, of the 
rights and wishes of parents, whether unimpeachable or otherwise, must be 
assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction 
with all other factors relevant to that issue."<BR>In the following paragraph he 
said:<BR>".... such rights and wishes, recognised as they are by nature and 
society, can be capable of administering to the total welfare of the child in a 
special way, and must therefore preponderate in many cases."<BR>However in 1973 
in <U>M v M</U> [1973] 2 All ER 81, Wrangham J suggested that Wilmer LJ, in 
speaking of the basic right of the parent, had meant that the companionship of a 
parent is of such value to the child that it creates the basic right in the 
child to such companionship.<BR>Latey J agreed with this restatement and in a 
passage characteristic of his experience he said:<BR>".... where the parents 
have separated and one has the care of the child, access by the other often 
results in some upset in the child. Those upsets are usually minor and 
superficial. They are heavily outweighed by the long-term advantages to the 
child of keeping in touch with the parent concerned so that they do not become 
strangers, so that the child later in life does not resent the deprivation and 
turn against the parent who the child thinks, rightly or wrongly, has deprived 
him, and so that the deprived parent loses interest in the child and therefore 
does not make the material and emotional contribution to the child's development 
which that parent by its companionship and otherwise would make."<BR>However the 
designation of contact as a right vested in any member of the family was 
subsequently disapproved in the characteristically clear language of Ormrod LJ. 
In the case of <U>A v C</U> [1985] FLR 445 he said:<BR>"The word `rights' is a 
highly confusing word which leads to a great deal of trouble if it is used 
loosely, particularly when it is used loosely in a court of law. So far as 
access to a child is concerned, there are no rights in the sense in which 
lawyers understand the word. It is a matter to be decided always entirely on the 
footing of the best interests of the child, either by agreement between the 
parties or by the court if there is no agreement."<BR>This passage was cited 
with approval in the case of <U>KD (Minor) (Ward: Termination of Access)</U> 
[1988] AC 806 where the court considered parental contact in what would now be 
classified as a public law case. In the course of his speech Lord Oliver 
considered the approach of this jurisdiction as formulated in the House's 
earlier decision in <U>J v C</U> with parental rights in the context of the 
European Convention. He said:<BR>"The word `right' is used in a variety of 
different senses, both popular and jurisprudential. It may be used as importing 
positive duty in some other individual for the non-performance of which the law 
will provide an appropriate remedy, as in the case of a right to the performance 
of a contract. It may signify merely a privilege conferring no corresponding 
duty on anyone save that of non-interference, such as the right to walk on the 
public highway. It may signify no more than the hope of or aspiration to a 
social order which will permit the exercise of that which is perceived as an 
essential liberty, such as, for instance, the so-called `right to work' or a 
`right' of personal privacy. Parenthood, in most civilised societies, is 
generally conceived of as conferring on parents the exclusive privilege of 
ordering, within the family, the upbringing of children of tender age, with all 
that that entails. That is a privilege which, if interfered with without 
authority, would be protected by the courts, but it is a privilege circumscribed 
by many limitations imposed both by the general law and, where the circumstances 
demand, by the courts or by the authorities on whom the legislature has imposed 
the duty of supervising the welfare of children and young persons. When the 
jurisdiction of the court is invoked for the protection of the child the 
parental privileges do not terminate. They do, however, become immediately 
subservient to the paramount consideration which the court has always in mind, 
that is to say the welfare of the child."<BR>Thereafter judicial statements as 
to how applications for contact should be determined have spoken not of rights 
but of either presumption or principle. Sir Thomas Bingham MR in considering the 
inter-relationship the courts power to order contact under <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s8.html">section 8</A> and 
its power to attach conditions under <A

said in the case of <U>Re O (Contact: Imposition of Conditions)</U> [1995] 2 FLR 
124 at 128:<BR>"It may perhaps be worth stating in a reasonably compendious way 
some very familiar but nonetheless fundamental principles. First of all, and

of the 1989 Act, the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration of any 
court concerned to make an order relating to the upbringing of a child. It 
cannot be emphasised too strongly that the court is concerned with the interests 
of the mother and the father only insofar as they bear on the welfare of the 
child.<BR>Secondly, where parents of a child are separated and the child is in 
the day to day care of one of them, it is almost always in the interests of the 
child that he or she should have contact with the other parent. The reason for 
this scarcely needs spelling out. It is, of course, that the separation of 
parents involves a loss to the child, and it is desirable that that loss should 
so far as possible be made good by contact with the non-custodial parent, that 
is the parent in whose day-to-day care the child is not."<BR>Lord Woolf MR in 
the case of <U>Re B (Contact: Stepfather's Opposition)</U> [1997] 2 FLR 579 
stated the general policy of this court that contact between a child and its 
natural parent is to be maintained wherever possible. He said at 
584:<BR>"[Counsel] is right in submitting that to deprive a father who bona fide 
wishes to have contact with his child of that contact is a drastic step. The 
court's general policy is clear: contact between a child and its natural parent 
is something which should be maintained wherever this is practical." <BR>I have 
cited these two cases since they carry the particular authority of the Master of 
the Rolls. However there are many others decided within the last five years both 
in this court and at first instance emphasising the principle generally 
expressed as `a presumption in favour of contact between a natural parent and 
children'. Indeed there is some evidence of a return to the language of rights: 
for example in <U>A v L (Contact)</U> [1998] 1 FLR 361 Holman J described 
contact as `a fundamental right of a child'.<BR>This reintroduction is perhaps 
not surprising in an age when the imminent commencement of the Human Rights Act 
focuses judicial study on rights and when Article 9(3) of the UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child declares that:<BR>"States Parties shall respect the 
right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain 
personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, 
except if it is contrary to the child's best interest."<BR>Although our statute 
does not replicate this treaty provision, in other states it is specifically 
enacted, for instance in Australia where the statute provides `children have a 
right of contact, on a regular basis, with both their parents'. Nearer home the 
relevant Scottish statutes have been considered by the House of Lords in <U>S v 
M (Access Order)</U> [1997] 1 FLR 980. The decision of the House illustrates 
another area of family law where there is a significant difference of approach 
on either side of the border. Lord Hope of Craighead in his speech at 987 
said:<BR>"The issue relates to the meaning and effect of section 3(2) of the 
Act. This subsection states that the welfare of the child is the paramount 
consideration. It does not say what other considerations may or may not be taken 
into account. But the court is told that it shall not make any order relating to 
parental rights unless it is satisfied that to do so will be in the interests of 
the child. The scope of the court's powers is indicated by the concluding words 
of the previous subsection, which states that the court may make such order 
relating to parental rights as it thinks fit.<BR>In my opinion the effect of <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s3.html">section 3</A>(2) 
is clear. The court is given a wide discretion as to the considerations pointing 
one way or the other which it may take into account. But all other 
considerations must yield to the consideration which is stated by the subsection 
to be paramount, which is the welfare of the child. As it is told that it `shall 
not' make any order relating to parental rights unless it is satisfied that `to 
do so' will be in the best interests of the child, the onus is on the party who 
seeks such an order to show on balance of probabilities that the welfare of the 
child requires that the order be made in the child's best interests."</P>
<P>He then posed the alternative approach:</P>
<P>"The point which was made by Lord McCluskey in his dissenting opinion in this 
case, which the Dean of Faculty invited us to follow, was this. In his view the 
link between the child and each of his natural parents is so important in itself 
that, unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary, it should be 
preserved. It is a link which has an intrinsic value quite independent of any 
supposed `right' of a parent to obtain an order from the court allowing access 
to his or her child."<BR>Then on the following page he rejected that approach in 
these words:<BR>"The more fundamental question, however, is whether the natural 
link between the child and his parent is so important that the court must always 
seek to preserve it unless there are strong reasons to the contrary. Whatever 
may have been the position at common law, the effect of <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s3.html">section 3</A>(2) 
of the 1986 Act has been to remove any rule or principle to this effect. Lord 
Dunpark had already recognised the fallacy in this approach, once the welfare of 
the child was made the paramount consideration, in the opinion which he 
delivered in <U>Porchetta v Porchetta</U>."<BR>So whilst some comparative study 
demonstrates a spectrum from rights through presumption to simple application of 
the welfare principle the significance of the distinction is reduced by what 
appears to be universal judicial recognition of the importance of contact to a 
child's development. Within our case law the shifts of judicial language are 
likely to be reflective of social attitudes and assumptions. I believe that 
Wilmer LJ meant exactly what he said in 1962. The statement was unremarkable 
nearly 40 years ago when uttered by a distinguished judge of his time, by which 
I mean born in the century before last. Many of the social developments amongst 
which we now live and work he would surely not have foreseen. When the law 
enters the field of child welfare statements of principle may not hold their 
value much beyond the times in which they were expressed. That proposition can 
be supported by the recollection that within my lifetime judges applied a rule 
that an adulterous mother not only sacrificed the care of her child but also 
regular contact. Furthermore there seem to me to be considerable difficulties 
with any return to the language of rights. Quite apart from the points made by 
Ormrod LJ and Lord Oliver in the cases cited, the creation of a right of the 
child does not lead to corresponding duties on parents. The errant or selfish 
parent can not be ordered to spend time with his child against his will however 
much the child may yearn for his company and the mother desire respite. The 
court's power is restricted to those cases in which the absent parent seeks and 
the parent with care opposes either the principle or the detail of contact. 
Furthermore it must be recognised that contact is no more than a mechanism for 
the maintenance and development of relationships and the court's powers are 
restricted to regulating the mechanism and do not extend to the underlying 
relationships.<BR>However the general judicial approach may currently be 
expressed I doubt that sufficient distinction has been made between cases in 
which contact is sought in order to maintain an existing relationship, to revive 
a dormant relationship or to create a non-existent relationship. The judicial 
assumption that to order contact would be to promote welfare should surely wane 
across that spectrum. I would not assume the benefit with unquestioning 
confidence where a child has developed over its early years without any 
knowledge of its father, particularly if over those crucially formative years a 
psychological attachment to an alternative father has been achieved.<BR>Just as 
there are difficulties with the terminology of rights so too am I wary of 
presumptions. Again the word has a special value in the context of adversarial 
litigation. There is a danger that the identification of a presumption will 
inhibit or distort the rigorous search for the welfare solution. There is also 
the danger that a presumption may be used as an aid to determination when the 
individual advocate or judge feels either undecided or overwhelmed. The expert 
report commissioned by the Official Solicitor from Dr Claire Sturge and Dr Danya 
Glaser (hereinafter referred to as Sturge/Glaser) speaks of the assumption in 
favour of contact. Although the distinction may be said to be fine, it perhaps 
more accurately reflects the base of knowledge and experience from which the 
court embarks upon its application of the welfare principle in each disputed 
contact application.<BR><B>The Foundation of the Universal Approach</B><BR>But 
what is the derivation of the judge's base of knowledge and experience? Most 
judges in our jurisdiction will have had the experience of parenting their own 
children. But few if any will have had education or training in child health and 
development. If a judge is challenged to demonstrate his qualification for 
discerning why one solution rather than another promotes the welfare of the 
child he may best rely upon the experience gained in his professional life as a 
specialist in family law, both as practitioner and judge. But, particularly in 
the most difficult cases, the judge will have the advantage of expert evidence 
from a mental health professional. The assumption that contact benefits the 
child cannot be derived from legal precedent or principle. It must find its 
foundation in the theory and practice of the mental health professions. Perhaps 
the largest single ingredient of a child's welfare is health, giving that word a 
broad definition to encompass physical, emotional and psychological development 
and well being. So both judicial general assumption and judicial assessment of 
welfare in the individual case are to be derived from the expertise of mental 
health professionals whose training and practice has centred on the development. 
needs and vulnerability of children. So for me the proposition that children 
benefit from contact with the parent with whom they no longer live must be drawn 
from current opinion shared by the majority of mental health 
professionals.<BR>In the present appeals the expert evidence is unanimous. 
Sturge/Glaser define the core principles drawn from scientific knowledge 
as:<BR>"(i) We see the centrality of the child as all important .... The needs 
of the adult positions obscure and overwhelm the needs of the child but 
promoting the child's mental health remains the central issue.<BR>(ii) To 
consider contact questions the purpose of any proposed contact must be overt and 
abundantly clear. Contact can only be an issue where it has the potential for 
benefiting the child in some way. Defining in what way this might be will help 
guide decisions about whether there should be contact and also its nature, 
duration and frequency.<BR>(iii) Decisions must involve a process of balancing 
different factors and the advantages and disadvantages of each. This includes 
contact versus no contact and whether to accept or go against the wishes of a 
child."<BR>This citation does not perhaps reflect the overall tenor of the 
report which fully identifies the benefits which children derive from continuing 
contact with the absent parent. The general proposition was authoritatively put 
by Dr Judith Trowell of the Tavistock in response to Wall J's consultation paper 
when she wrote:<BR>"The Tavistock Clinic has considerable clinical and research 
experience as a child, adolescent and family mental health specialist service 
with families where parents have separated (married or unmarried). There is no 
doubt that for most children their mental health, their emotional, psychological 
and social development are enhanced by regular contact with their parent and 
extended family. See: Working with Children and Parents through Separation and 
Divorce (1999) Dowling &amp; Gorrell-Barnes: Macmillan Press."<BR>In the work 
cited the authors' state at 178:<BR>"From research and clinical experience we 
know that children do better if:<BR>* There is no ongoing conflict between the 
parents.<BR>* They maintain free and easy contact with both parents.<BR>* They 
have a coherent explanation about the break-up of the family.<BR>* They have 
stability and predictability in terms of contact arrangements with the out of 
house parent."<BR>Although there can be no doubt of the secure foundation for 
the assumption that contact benefits children there is another view which found 
powerful expression in one of the references cited by Sturge/Glaser: Goldstein, 
Freud and Solnit (1973) Beyond the Best Interests of the Child. Although a 
profoundly influential publication, the authors seemingly expressed a minority 
view that contact should not be imposed but should be restricted to whatever the 
parent with primary care deemed sensible. When this opinion attracted widespread 
criticism the authors in an epilogue to a subsequent edition published in 1983 
trenchantly defended their original view. However the premise now appears to 
lack support.<BR><B>The Limitations of Litigation</B><BR>However there is in my 
opinion validity in questioning the future role of the family justice system in 
relation to contact. I have already expressed how limited is the capacity of the 
family justice system to produce good outcomes in disputed areas of personal 
relationship. Yet a great deal of the resources of the system are taken up with 
contested contact cases. The disputes are particularly prevalent and 
intractable. They consume a disproportionate quantity of private law judicial 
time. The disputes are often driven by personality disorders, unresolved adult 
conflicts or egocentricity. These originating or contributing factors would 
generally be better treated therapeutically, where at least there would be some 
prospect of beneficial change, rather than given vent in the family justice 
system. As Judge Rudd pointed out in the case of <U>M</U> the issue that had 
consumed nearly 20,000 of public money in his court would have been more 
appropriately tried by an experienced bench of magistrates. I am in complete 
agreement with that view. The family proceedings courts are a much under used 
resource in private law disputes, particularly in deciding disputed applications 
as to the duration or detail of contact. Equally in my opinion too much of the 
time of this court has been devoted to applications and appeals relating to 
contact orders either made or denied to which one party cannot adjust. It needs 
to be recognised that a decision is essentially a discretionary evaluation of 
the welfare considerations. Since the commencement of the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A> 
such decisions are restricted to benches and judges specifically trained and 
appointed for the task. The advent of much enhanced specialisation within the 
family justice system is an extremely significant development of the past decade 
and cases in which it can be said convincingly that the trial judge was plainly 
wrong in determining a contact dispute upon the application of the welfare 
principle must be rare indeed. Another deficiency of the family justice system 
in relation to contact disputes is that it lacks any support services other than 
the aid of the court welfare officer in preparation for the final hearing. There 
is no qualified and experienced professional that the judge can request to 
implement arrangements, to work with the family or to search out and engage the 
absent and reluctant parent. The shortcomings of the family assistance order are 
manifest. The court's capacity to resolve the challenge of what has been called 
the implacably hostile parent is evident. The practical difficulties posed by 
the power to commit are obvious. Treatment rather than imprisonment would seem 
more likely to succeed. However if it be unrealistic to question the continuing 
role of the family justice system in promoting post separation contact then I 
would express the hope that the newly created CAFCASS service be given a role to 
address those aspects of the fractured relationships that the court in the 
exercise of its statutory and inherent powers cannot approach.<BR>Finally I 
would question whether the investment of public funds in litigation as the 
conventional mode of resolving contact disputes is comparatively productive. In 
many cases the same investment in therapeutic services might produce greater 
benefit. Within the NHS, Child and Mental Health Services work with warring 
parents to try and help them separate their parenting role from the breakdown of 
the partnership. If one parent has a mental illness or personality disorder the 
service can help the family to manage perhaps by providing sessions with the 
children to help them understand their situation. Within the voluntary sector 
there are exceptional facilities, such as the Accord Centre in Brent, that 
provide more than neutral space for contact, and perhaps some professional 
supervision or assessment. Such centres attempt to address the underlying 
dysfunction in family relationship that expresses itself in the absence or 
failure of contact. In some cases they may work with the family therapeutically 
for weeks before attempting any direct contact. It must at least be arguable 
that that expenditure of effort and cost is likely to achieve more than an equal 
expenditure on litigation with its tendency to increase alienation through its 
adversarial emphasis. Of course there will always be many cases that are only 
fit for referral to litigation. But in my opinion judges with responsibility for 
case management should be thoroughly informed as to available alternative 
services in the locality and astute in selecting the service best suited to 
promote the welfare of the child in each case.<BR><B>Contact and Domestic 
Violence</B><BR>It was, in my opinion, necessary to establish the strength of 
the professional assumptions in favour of contact orders before examining the 
inter-relationship of contact and domestic violence. Domestic violence is one of 
a catalogue of factors that may operate to offset the assumption for contact but 
it has not been separately categorised in either statute or case law nor, in my 
opinion, should it be. However it is worth noting that the last of the four 
general principles underlying Parts II and III of the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act 
1996</A> (yet to come into force and only of application to the families on the 
verge of divorce or judicial separation) is:<BR>"(d) that any risk to one of the 
parties to a marriage, and to any children, of violence from the other party 
should, so far as reasonably practicable, be removed or diminished."<BR>The 
reported cases on the topic are sparse: <U>Re A</U> [1998] 2 FLR 171, <U>Re 
P</U> in the same volume at 696, <U>Re H</U> in the same volume at 42 and <U>Re 
M</U> [1999] 2 FLR 321. This constellation of cases may suggest an emerging 
modern problem, although certainly not one created by any shift in the pattern 
of human behaviour.<BR>In giving the leading judgment in the case of <U>Re H</U> 
in this court Wall J said:<BR>"The point that has troubled me most on this 
aspect of the case is the question of domestic violence. Can it be said, as a 
matter of principle, that it is in the interests of children to impose an order 
for contact on a mother who is caring for them well in favour of a father who 
has treated her with such violence as to give her good and valid reasons to 
oppose contact?<BR>Having asked the question, however, the answer must be that, 
as a matter of principle, domestic violence of itself cannot constitute a bar to 
contact. Each case must inevitably be decided on its facts. Domestic violence 
can only be one factor in a very complex equation. There will be contact cases 
in which it is decisive against contact. There will be others in which it will 
be peripheral. For example, <U>Re D</U>, to which I have already referred, 
demonstrates that domestic violence may both provide a powerful basis for a 
mother's objection to contact and demonstrate in a given case the father's 
unfitness to exercise contact.<BR>The matter is therefore not one of principle, 
but of discretion, and there thus remains the question whether or not, on the 
facts of this case, the recorder erred in what is conventionally called the 
balancing exercise."</P>
<P>I am in complete agreement with that analysis. Wall J went on to emphasise 
the obligation on the father first to acknowledge and then to address his 
maltreatment of the mother. Wall J was in my view absolutely right to introduce 
this vital consideration, although its introduction only reveals the limitations 
on the court's powers to direct and supervise the delivery of, as well as the 
father's engagement in, available therapeutic services.</P>
<P><BR>Wall J returned to that theme when deciding an appeal from the family 
proceedings court in <U>Re M</U>. In that case he said towards the conclusion of 
his judgment:<BR>"Often in these cases where domestic violence has been found, 
too little weight in my judgment is given to the need for the father to change. 
It is often said that, not withstanding the violence, the mother must 
nonetheless bring up the children with full knowledge in a positive image of 
their natural father and arrange for the children to be available for contact. 
Too often it seems to me the courts neglect the other side of that equation, 
which is that a father, like this father, must demonstrate that he is a fit 
person to exercise contact; that he is not going to destabilise the family, that 
he is not going to upset the children and harm them emotionally."<BR>Apart from 
Wall J's contribution in these judgments he has done most valuable work as 
chairman of the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act</A> 
sub-committee of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Board on Family Law culminating 
in his recently published report to the Lord Chancellor. The report is obviously 
of great value not least because it digests a wide range of responses to a well 
publicised consultation.<BR>The extent to which judges throughout the 
jurisdiction have been elevating a presumption in favour of a contact order too 
high or trivialising a history of domestic violence must remain uncertain. 
Certainly applications and appeals to the Court of Appeal over the course of the 
past five years do not suggest that contact orders have been made when plainly 
they should have been refused. Nor have other professions brought their concerns 
to the President's Interdisciplinary Family Law Committee, save in one instance. 
However I have been impressed by the research of Professor Bailey-Harris and 
others into the presumption of contact in practice: reported in International 
Journal of Law, Policy and the Family (1999) 111 and I must acknowledge the help 
that I have drawn from this article. That research demonstrates that:<BR>* 
Solicitors and district judges in their daily work in the field of contact 
concentrate on future arrangements and discourage the ventilation of past 
history. They consistently set the presumption in favour of contact high.<BR>* 
Research evidence, particularly the reports of Hester and Radford in 1995 and 
1996, demonstrated that children are seriously harmed by witnessing family 
violence and that violent fathers use the opportunity of contact to continue 
abuse.<BR>* The research was recognised by court welfare officers but remained 
unknown to the legal professions. The court welfare officers sensed a need to 
educate the judges.<BR>* Nevertheless during the period of investigation, 
January 1996 to May 1997, there was little evidence of any shift of approach and 
therefore outcome.<BR>This research demonstrates to me the value of the work 
that Wall J has done in drawing attention to the need to re-evaluate domestic 
violence in its impact on continuing relationships within the family after 
separation.<BR>In relation to judicial knowledge it will always be difficult, 
even for specialists, to educate themselves as to research in the field of child 
protection as well as generally in family proceedings. Although the work of the 
Judicial Studies Board is invaluable it is necessarily limited in what it can 
undertake. But there is an obvious opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange on 
a local basis within the scope of a care centre interdisciplinary forum. 
Professor Bailey-Harris' research offers merely one example of how social work 
expertise might have been shared amongst lawyers and judges to ensure that 
messages from recent research did not go unheard. The re-invigoration of the 
care centre forums as part of the creation of a support structure for the family 
justice system is in my opinion overdue. A very recent publication commissioned 
by the Department of Health makes the findings of recent research available in 
easily accessible form: Making an Impact, Children and Domestic Violence: 
Hester, Pearson and Harrison: 2000: Kingsley Publishers Limited. At 42 they 
wrote:<BR>"The arrangements made for contact with violent fathers need to be 
considered in relation to the protection of children from abuse and harm. It is 
in the arena of contact that the ongoing abuse of children, both directly and 
indirectly, is likely to continue and yet may be ignored."<BR>However the 
factors that may offset the assumption in favour of contact are probably too 
legion to be either listed or categorised. Abuse must form the largest 
compartment: as well as physical abuse of the other parent and/or a child there 
is equally sexual and emotional abuse within the family. Then there is the self 
abuse of either drugs or alcohol and the failure to maintain sexual boundaries 
appropriate to the development of the child. Additionally mental illness or 
personality disorder may be a dominant factor as may be malign motives prompting 
the applicant to pursue a seemingly justifiable application for the covert 
purpose of threatening or dominating the primary carer. This uncomprehensive 
catalogue only demonstrates that the factor of domestic violence must be kept in 
proportion and must not be elevated either to reduce the focus on other factors 
that may counter the assumption in favour of contact or otherwise distort the 
paramount judicial task. My primary conclusion is that listing of the present 
appeals and the great assistance given by the Official Solicitor, by Mr 
Posnansky QC and by the Sturge/Glaser report does not call for any adjustment of 
the approach adopted by Wall J in the passages that I have cited from his 
judgments in <U>Re H</U> and in <U>Re M</U>. The danger of elevating any one 
factor in what will always be an extremely complex evaluation is to move the 
pendulum too far and thus to create an excessive concentration on past history 
and an over-reflection of physical abuse within the determination of individual 
cases. I would not adopt the suggestion in the Sturge/Glaser report:<BR>"From 
all that is written above, it will be clear that we consider that there should 
be no automatic assumption that contact to a previously or currently violent 
parent is in the child's interests; if anything the assumption should be in the 
opposite direction and the case of the non-residential parent one of proving why 
he can offer something of such benefit not only to the child but to the child's 
situation .... that contact should be considered."<BR>As the quotation itself 
suggests there is a spectrum within the broad categorisation of domestic 
violence from the slap that may have been provoked to premeditated murder. There 
is the equally obvious distinction between past abuse which has been 
acknowledged and addressed and a continuing risk of future violence if any 
opportunity is created. In my opinion the only direction that can be given to 
the trial judge is to apply the welfare principle and the welfare check list, <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 1</A>(1) 
and (3) of the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A>, 
to the facts of the particular case. It follows that I am doubtful as to whether 
specific guidelines are now required but my preference would be for brevity and 
simplicity always bearing in mind the risk of creating satellite litigation as 
to how the guidelines should be construed and applied.<BR><B>Lord Justice 
Waller: </B>I agree that these appeals should be dismissed. They were listed to 
be heard together because of a possible common ingredient - domestic violence of 
the non resident parent against the resident parent, and the relevance of the 
same to the issue of contact with the non resident parent. I have read with 
admiration the observations of the President and Lord Justice Thorpe on that 
subject. Without being exhaustive the key points which it may be helpful for me 
to emphasise appear to be the following.<BR>1. The effect of children being 
exposed to domestic violence of one parent as against the other <U>may </U>up 
until now have been underestimated by judges, and advisers alike;<BR>2. It 
follows that alleged domestic violence is a matter that ought to be 
investigated, and on which findings of fact should be made because if it is 
established, its effect on children exposed to it, and the risk to the 
residential carer are highly relevant factors in considering orders for contact 
and their form;<BR>3. In assessing the relevance of past domestic violence, it 
is likely to be highly material whether the perpetrator has shown an ability to 
recognise the wrong he (or less commonly she) has done, and the steps taken to 
correct the deficiency in the perpetrator's character;<BR>4. There should 
however be no presumption against contact simply because domestic violence is 
alleged or proved; domestic violence is not to be elevated to some special 
category; it is one highly material factor amongst many which may offset the 
assumption in favour of contact.when the difficult balancing exercise is carried 
out by the judge applying the welfare principle and the welfare check list, <A
