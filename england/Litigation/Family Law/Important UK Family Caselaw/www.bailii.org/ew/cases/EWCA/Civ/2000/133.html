Copyright ©</CENTER><BR><BR><B>LORD JUSTICE WARD:</B><BR>This appeal has become 
more and more difficult the longer it was heard. It is an international child 
abduction case. The children are G who was born in London on 9 January 1989, so 
she is just 11 years old. Her brother, T, is only 6 having been born in Spain on 
22 July 1993. Both parents are British nationals but they have lived in Spain 
since shortly before T's birth. Mother is aged 46 but father is approaching his 
60th birthday. The marriage of these parents has been under strain for some time 
and the mother commenced related proceedings for divorce and custody in Spain in 
July 1997. The Spanish court has been seised of the difficulties ever since then 
and, as I must explain in detail later, there have been a succession of hearings 
and orders made regarding the residence and visiting rights of the children. 
<BR>On 3 January 2000 the father wrongfully removed G and T from Spain in breach 
of the mother's rights of custody and has established a home near his adult 
children by a former marriage and their families in Suffolk. This move, not the 
first abduction from Spain, was in flagrant defiance of the Spanish court in 
whom the father has no confidence. My instinctive reaction is to say that an 
English court will not tolerate behaviour of that kind: these are children who 
have been habitually resident in Spain, the Spanish court is seised of the 
matter and it is the Spanish court and only the Spanish court which should 
determine the many disputes of fact which form the backcloth to the separation 
and more importantly to the events which have shaped the children's lives. 
<BR>That was the view taken by Wall J. He rejected the father's defences under 
Article 13 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction that there was a grave risk that the return of the children would 
expose them to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them in an 
intolerable situation. Although it was not in any real dispute that G objected 
to being returned, he found that she had not attained an age and a degree of 
maturity at which it was appropriate to take any account of her views which he 
held were shaped by the father's hostility to the mother. Even if her views were 
to be taken in to account, he would have refused to exercise his discretion in 
order to give effect to the spirit of the Convention which demands the return to 
the country of habitual residence, especially where, as here, the Spanish courts 
were fully seised of the problems. Thus on 3 March 2000 Wall J. ordered their 
return to Spain. My first impression on reading his judgment was that that 
conclusion was hardly a surprise. Now it is no longer as simple as at first it 
seemed. <BR>Until late in the appeal, attention was focused on G's objections, 
and scarcely a thought was spared for T. G's position cannot be more eloquently 
expressed than she herself expressed it in a letter dated 1 February 2000 sent 
in answer to a letter, which cannot be criticised in any way, sent by her mother 
the previous day with "lots and lots of love and lots of hugs and kisses." This 
is how G responded:<BR>"Mum,<BR>As you have been phoning Angie nearly every day 
and didn't ask to speak to us I was wondering when you were going to contact us 
but when I read your letter I saw that it was the same rubish (sic) that you 
sent me on my birth day (sic) so you didn't have to bother.<BR>1st I don't have 
a clue who these people are that are sending their love like John &amp; 
Tara.<BR>2nd Uncle Brendan hasn't contacted me since we've been in Spain so I 
don't see wy (sic) he's sending his love now. Grandad hasn't contacted me either 
since I've been in Spain either so I don't see wy (sic) he's sending his love. I 
haven't heard from auntie Carol or Andrew for years so, wy (sic) are they taking 
interest for (sic) us now?<BR>I'm frightened that I'm going to have to live in 
Spain again and I'm frightened that I'm going to have to live with you. You know 
how dangerous you are when you get drunk and don't tell me you've stoped (sic) 
drinking because you were drunk the day we left and I smelled your breth (sic) 
when you came to court and you'de (sic) been drinking.<BR>If you want to do 
something for me and T stop trying to make us go back to live in that crummy 
little village in Spain were (sic) all my friends know how you keep getting 
drunk all the time.<BR>I see you've been sending faxes to the school the same as 
you did in Berja and Albox to make more trouble for us again. Wy (sic) can't you 
leave us in peace?<BR>We want to live in England near to Gi, Angie, Jay &amp; 
Kane and now that we are friends again with Nancy &amp; Gary, Leanne &amp; 
Chelsea. If you realy (sic) want to see us, wy (sic) don't you come to live in 
England instead of spoiling our lives?<BR>G"<BR>That letter persuaded me to give 
permission to appeal. <BR>The issues which now arise on this appeal are:-<BR>1. 
Was the judge wrong to take no account of G's objections?<BR>2. If so, was he 
wrong to exercise his discretion to order her return?<BR>3. Was he wrong to find 
that the Article 13(b) argument "cannot get off the ground?" <BR>4. If he was 
wrong to order G's return, what is to happen to T?<BR>None of these questions 
admit of easy answer.<BR>I must now develop the story. <BR>The father had long 
service in the Parachute Regiment until he was invalided out following some 
injury. He is a tough character. He has an enhanced army pension. He 
subsequently suffered some other injury for which he has an additional 
disability allowance. He was previously married and has children and 
grandchildren. <BR>After leaving school the mother worked in an administrative 
capacity in television, eventually for Channel 4. Although she had previously 
been unenthusiastic or ambivalent about having a child, she was surprised and 
then somewhat overwhelmed by the strength of her maternal feelings after the 
birth of her daughter. She became very keen to have another child but suffered 
miscarriages. She blamed her work for that misfortune. She became more and more 
depressed. She began to abuse alcohol heavily. In that condition, which I have 
taken from a psychiatric report of Dr Pitcher dated 5 February 1993, she stole 
some £34,000 from her employer and was given an eighteen month suspended prison 
sentence. By then she was expecting T. Perhaps to make a new start, the family 
emigrated to Spain. <BR>The marriage had its difficulties. The cause of the 
deterioration, according to the mother, was the father's aggressive and violent 
conduct towards her. Its cause, according to him, was the mother's alcoholism. 
They separated in June 1997. The mother commenced proceedings in the Spanish 
court and on 25 July 1997 an interim custody order was made in the mother's 
favour with liberal visiting rights afforded the father. The children's 
passports were surrendered to the court where they have remained. In January 
1998 there was a reconciliation formally recorded by a notary, the effect of 
which may have been to suspend the custody order. It does not much matter. On 
about 28 January 1998 the father took the children to Gibraltar without the 
mother's knowledge or consent. Believing them to have come to England, she 
commenced proceedings here under the Hague Convention before she learnt where 
they were. She then made the children wards of court in Gibraltar and on 24 
February 1998 Scholfield C.J., having received written and oral evidence from 
the parties, ordered the father to return the children to the mother. In his 
judgment he said this:-<BR>"The documentary evidence I have before me shows that 
the wife may have abused alcohol in her past but there is no evidence to support 
the husband's assertions that she is a complete drunk. I am satisfied after 
reviewing all the material before me that she is perfectly capable of caring 
properly for her two children. <BR>...<BR>I conclude that the reason for the 
husband's departure from Spain with the children is that he knew he was not 
going to get his own way with the evidence he could present to the Court and 
felt he could gain an advantage by taking the children out of the jurisdiction 
and that he has made up evidence to justify his actions."<BR>It is a damning 
judgment on the father. It ought also to have given the mother warning of the 
consequences of her drinking. <BR>A second custody order had been made in Spain 
in February 1998 following that abduction but it appears to have lapsed. There 
was then an incident in July 1998 in which the husband alleges that the mother, 
the worse for drink, struck him with a baseball bat and threw his briefcase into 
a swimming pool. He removed the children from her. She obtained, for the third 
time, a custody order in her favour. The father was arrested for not handing the 
children over pursuant to that order. In September 1998, again, according to the 
husband, under the influence of drink, mother removed G from hospital in the 
early hours of the morning and the police were involved again. G was interviewed 
by the Spanish authorities following these incidents which may have been but two 
of many. <BR>There was then a major incident early in May. It is common ground 
that the mother, whether under the influence of drink alone or a combination of 
drink and the medication she was receiving for depression, was unfit to care for 
the children and the father removed them. On 7 May 1999 the Spanish court 
awarded physical custody of the children to the father but legal custody or 
parental responsibility, "patria potestad", was to be shared by both parents. It 
was an interim order and the court directed that the Child Protection team of 
the Almeria courts provide further information in a psychological and social 
report. Thereafter the matter would be reconsidered. <BR>The Father then removed 
himself and the children from the area where they had been living and 
established a new home some distance away in Albox. This made contact difficult. 
The husband gave this explanation in his first affidavit sworn in these 
proceedings:-<BR>"We moved house primarily because the children felt ostracised 
by the local community and at school because of the behaviour of the mother. The 
mother who refers to her nervous breakdown in her affidavit in fact suffers from 
persistent states of inebriation from alcoholism when she passes out in the 
street and at home. G has had to call the police on more than one occasion 
regarding her mother's state. This problem has never gone away and it is the 
mother's alcoholism, her refusal to deal with it and the consequences of it that 
cause the children, particularly G, psychological harm and places them in an 
intolerable position."<BR>It seems that the father then applied to vary the 
visiting rights that had been ordered in May and he also sought permission to 
take the children to England from 22 December to 1 January for a holiday. These 
matters came before the Berja court on 21 December 1999. The court refused to 
sanction the move of the children and ordered:-<BR>"The minors T and G ... shall 
return their home in Almerimar and to the school at Berja at which they were 
studying; in the event their father should fail to comply with this order they 
shall be removed from his physical custody."<BR>The court also refused to permit 
father to travel to England for Christmas finding as follows:-<BR>"This is again 
a question of legal custody ("patria potestad") and not only physical custody 
and therefore the consent of both parents is required. Permitting the children 
to leave Spain would not only deprive their mother of her visiting rights but 
there is also a real danger that the children might not return, particularly 
since (the father) stated during an appearance before the Andalucia 
<I>Tribunal</I> <I>Superior de Justicia </I>(Appeal Court) that he wishes to "go 
to England and to let her see what she can do with her proceeding 
there"."<BR>The effect of that order was plain enough and was well understood by 
the father. Nevertheless, defying the Spanish court he persuaded a friend to 
allow the children to pass as hers on her passport and removed them to Suffolk. 
He sent a fax to the Child Abduction Department of the Lord Chancellor's Office 
on Sunday 2 January 2000 stating :-<BR>"I wish to notify you that it is my 
intention to bring my two children named above to the United Kingdom, against 
the wishes of their mother."<BR>In his first affidavit he admitted that that was 
in breach of her rights of custody. Wall J. so found without difficulty. 
Although he has sought to argue against it, I refused him permission to do so. 
<BR>These proceedings were commenced by the mother on 10 January 2000. Meanwhile 
the Spanish proceedings continued. The psychological report which had been 
called for in May was prepared in December and a hearing was fixed for 19 
January. The father was not present but his lawyer was. Some oral evidence was 
taken from the social worker and psychologist who prepared the report. I shall 
refer to it later. The hearing was adjourned to 27 January. The father knew of 
it; indeed he told Singer J. on 24 January that he had no wish to go to Spain to 
take part in those proceedings. The Spanish court, therefore, proceeded in his 
absence though he appears again to have been represented by his lawyer. There 
was a further hearing on 7 February - perhaps in the divorce proceeding - when 
the court, applying "the supremacy of the interest of the minor over any other 
legitimate interest", a test essentially no different from ours, held:-<BR>"It 
is clear that the mother is suitable to have the care and custody of the 
children and (the father) has been influencing the children to "damage the image 
of the mother and affect their feelings towards her", depriving them of a mother 
figure. In view of the investigations made with the minor children and the visit 
to the minor G, there is a doubt as to how to evaluate her wishes, for this it 
has been clearly observed that she is heavily influenced by her father and it 
has to be put into the context of the influence of a father over a daughter who, 
being 10 years of age, is strongly influenced. Accordingly, even though it may 
be against the will of the child, (the mother) must have the care and custody of 
the children, as has previously been stated."<BR>The father has appealed that 
order but the mother seeks to enforce it under the provisions of the European 
Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of 
Children and on the Restoration of Custody of Children which was signed in 
Luxembourg on 20 May 1980. <BR>On 11 February Bennett J. refused the father's 
application to refer G to a consultant child psychiatrist but permitted letters 
from a general practitioner, Dr McIver, to be placed before the court. He also 
directed that the court welfare officer should prepare an oral report for the 
court as to the objections, if any, G had to returning to Spain. <BR><I>The 
judgment under appeal</I><BR>Wall J. heard the application on 3 March. He 
held:-<BR>"The children at the date of the abduction, which I have found to be 
unlawful, were plainly habitually resident in Spain; all the evidence of their 
past life relates to Spain and, in my judgment, applying the principles of the 
Convention, it is clear to me that, notwithstanding the fact that we are dealing 
here with an English couple and children who are the children of an English 
couple, Spain is undoubtedly the appropriate court under the Convention to 
decide these children's futures. It therefore seems to me that, applying 
Convention principles in relation to the speedy return of children to the 
country of their habitual residence for their future to be decided in that 
jurisdiction (sic). This case is particularly strong because the Spanish court 
has in the past been fully seised of the matter and has made full orders on full 
information. (The father's) decision not to attend and participate cannot, in my 
judgment, derogate from that. The question therefore becomes is this a case 
which can be brought within any part of Article 13."<BR>He then dealt with the 
two limbs of Article 13 which were relied upon. He said:-<BR>"The first is 
Article 13(b), which permits me not to order the return of either child if (the 
father) is able to establish that there is a grave risk that the children's 
return would expose them to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place 
them in an intolerable situation. In my judgment, on the facts of this case, 
that argument cannot get off the ground.<BR>The Spanish court has found as a 
fact that the mother is fully capable of caring for the children. The Spanish 
court has found that it is in their interest to reside with their mother, and 
the only arguable reason why the children, and G in particular, might be placed 
in an intolerable position is because (the father) tells me that he is 
steadfastly against ever returning to Spain. It is well established in this 
court - and I need not refer to specific authority - that where the intolerable 
situation... arises because of the refusal of the parent raising the argument to 
return to the jurisdiction to which the child is to go, the argument reduces in 
weight very substantially indeed. Indeed on the facts of this case in my 
judgment it becomes quite untenable. <BR>On (the father's) argument, G will be 
placed in an intolerable situation because of his wife's alcoholism and 
incapacity to care for her. His difficulty there of course is that the Spanish 
court has found to the contrary."<BR>He then turned to what he regarded 
as:-<BR>"... the most difficult and unhappy part of this case is the fact that, 
on the evidence, G appears to have a totally negative view of her mother, a 
totally positive view of her father and is expressing a wish to remain in 
England, in her father's care."<BR>In his written evidence the father had 
referred to threats made by G in Spain to commit suicide. He also produced a 
letter from a family friend to whom G is alleged to have said that she would 
rather die than go back to Spain. The father therefore referred her to Dr 
McIver, a general practitioner who in turn referred her to the local Child and 
Family psychiatric clinic where she was seen by a Mr Middlecoat, an experienced 
psychiatric nurse and psycho-therapist who works under the supervision of Dr 
Delany, the consultant child psychiatrist. Dr McIver wrote two letters on 10 
February to which the judge did not refer in his judgment although they were 
apparently before him. He did refer to Dr McIver's letter of 17 February in 
which he wrote:-<BR>"Mr Middlecoat stated that he felt G was not clinically 
depressed but he did feel she was vulnerable because of all that has happened to 
her. This includes discussion with you and her mother and having to act as 
"little parent" to T. Mr Middlecoat expressed some concern that you had said you 
did not feel you could return to Spain if the court ruled that G must. He felt 
this put her under a considerable amount of pressure and that she might then 
become depressed or react adversely to distress. She had expressed to him her 
feeling that matters were entirely beyond her control and could not influence 
them in any way. He did feel that if the situation arose, your presence in Spain 
would take at least some weight off G's shoulders. He felt that G had been 
overwhelmed by adult debate, by courts and legal process. He felt she needed to 
be protected from the adverse affects of these and that some buffering mechanism 
was necessary. He noticed, as I did, her flattened effect, which he ascribes to 
conflict which is going on around her. She had expressed to him the wish that 
she could wake up from this as if from a bad nightmare, which of course is 
impossible. I am relieved the conclusion is that she is not in immediate danger 
of self-harm but has sounded a note of caution about the future. I am very 
grateful to the court for accepting my earlier letter. I very much hope the 
court will listen to G and take her feeling into account."<BR>The judge also 
referred to a further letter of 25 February recording a telephone conversation 
with Dr Delany who:-<BR>"Asked me to state how keen G was to stay in England and 
how clear and unambiguous she was in expressing this wish. She was profoundly 
distressed at the prospect of departing under the proposed care arrangements. I 
would ask that the court should kindly take this into consideration."<BR>The 
judge then dealt with the court welfare officer's views. She had had a long 
conversation with G. The judge recorded her evidence as follows:-<BR>"She 
assessed her (G) as having a level of maturity commensurate with her 
chronological age. (The court welfare officer) reported her as thoughtful about 
what she had said and that her views did not appear to be rehearsed and appeared 
to be her own. She had spoken very positively about her relationship with her 
father. ... <BR>However, she could not find anything positive to say about her 
mother despite prompts (from the court welfare officer) about the past. ... She 
talked about her mother's drinking and the effect that had had on G. ... She 
referred to broken promises from her mother, about giving up drinking. She did 
not want to see her. ... <BR>She enjoyed school in Spain but she wanted an 
English education and said that, although she was bi-lingual, she did not write 
English well; so she wanted to be able to study English. She spoke very 
positively about the school in England and indeed there is a note from the 
school saying that she has settled well. When asked what she missed from Spain, 
she said there was not anything. She had friends in Spain and she would quite 
like to go back for a visit, but was happy in England. <BR>When cross examined, 
Ms Morris, (the court welfare officer) accepted that she was not in a position 
to contradict the views taken in the Spanish psychological report; nothing she 
noticed would cause her to have a contrary view to that report, although at the 
same time did not give Ms Morris the impression that she had been overtly 
influenced. She did not agree with the suggestion in the English reports that G 
was overwhelmed by the adult debates; her view was that G was fed up with it but 
was quite able to articulate what she wanted."<BR>The judge summarised her 
evidence in this way:-<BR>"It was part of the consistency between her 
chronological age and her emotional development that she did not see things in 
absolutely black and white terms. She did not have the degree of maturity to be 
able to appreciate that things were not entirely black and white and indeed the 
very force with which she had taken sides was an indication that her level of 
maturity was that consistent with an 11 year old rather than with a child of 
more mature years who would be able to understand the pros and cons in a much 
more balanced way."<BR>The judge then posed the question:-<BR>"Should I, under 
Article 13, decline to return G and <I>as a consequence T</I> because, under 
that Article she objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of 
maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views."<BR>I have 
added the emphasis and shall comment about it when I deal with T.<BR>The judge 
made the point that he had read the documentation carefully but he 
concluded:-<BR>"I have to say I feel strongly that G herself has been placed 
under very substantial pressure by her father. Her father ... filed a second 
affidavit ... which is effectively a diatribe against his wife and her capacity, 
or lack of it as a mother. ... Although he tried to assure me that he had never 
run their mother down in the children's presence or to the children, I find that 
submission impossible to accept.<BR>It is very plain to me that G, although she 
may well have had unhappy experiences in her mother's care, has wholly absorbed 
her father's negative views and is repeating them and, although she may feel 
them genuinely, I am equally satisfied that the additional pressure which has 
been placed on her is her knowledge that, under no circumstances, will her 
father return to Spain, as he said. That makes it impossible, in my view, for 
her to exercise any independent judgment.<BR>In these circumstances I have to 
say that I do not think, sympathetic as I am to G, that she is of an age and 
maturity were it is appropriate for me to take account of her wishes to the 
extent that I decline to order her return to Spain. But even if I am wrong about 
that and even if, contrary to my view, she is of an age and maturity for her 
views to be taken account of, I have to look at the policy of the Convention and 
what has happened here."<BR>He referred to this being the second abduction by 
the father in blatant disregard and disobedience to an order of the Spanish 
court. He referred to <I>re S</I> [1993] Fam 242. He held:-<BR>"... it would (in 
the trite phrase) drive a coach and horses through the Convention and be quite 
contrary to the policy of the Convention if I were to decline to return G to 
Spain ... .<BR>Here objectively the Spanish court has found that there is no 
basis for G's fears. She has been plainly influenced by her father, not least by 
his expressed refusal to return to Spain. In those circumstances it seems to me 
it would be quite wrong for me to exercise my discretion to allow her to remain 
here."<BR>I gave permission to appeal, limiting the appeal to the Article 13 
defences. Article 13 provides:-<BR>"Notwithstanding the provisions of the 
preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested 
State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution 
or other body which opposes its return establishes that -<BR>(a) ...<BR>(b) 
there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical 
or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. 
<BR>The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return 
of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has 
attained an age and a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take 
account of its views."<BR><I>The child's objections: the proper approach to the 
question</I><BR>In<I> re S. (A Minor) (Abduction; Custody Rights)</I> [1993] 
Fam. 242 is the leading authority and the following principles can be derived 
from the judgment of the court given by Balcombe L.J.:-<BR>1. The part of 
Article 13 which relates to the child's objections to being returned is 
completely separate from paragraph (b) and there is no reason to interpret this 
part of the Article as importing a requirement to establish a grave risk that 
the return of the child would expose her to harm, or otherwise place her in an 
intolerable situation. <BR>2. The questions whether: (i) a child objects to 
being returned; and (ii) has attained an age and a degree of maturity at which 
it is appropriate to take account of its views, are questions of fact which are 
peculiarly within the province of the trial judge.<BR>3. It will usually be 
necessary for the judge to find out why the child objects to being returned. If 
the only reason is because it wants to remain with the abducting parent, who is 
asserting that he or she is unwilling to return, then this will be a highly 
relevant factor when the judge comes to consider the exercise of 
discretion.<BR>4. Article 13 does not seek to lay down any age below which a 
child is to be considered as not having attained sufficient maturity for its 
views to be taken into account. (As a matter of fact, the child in S, whose 
objections prevailed, was only 9 years old.)<BR>5. If the court should come to 
the conclusion that the child's views have been influenced by some other person, 
for example the abducting parent, or that the objection to return is because of 
a wish to remain with the abducting parent, then it is probable that little or 
no weight will be given to those views.<BR>6. On the other hand, where the court 
finds that the child has valid reasons for her objection to being returned, then 
it may refuse to order the return.<BR>7. Nevertheless it is only in exceptional 
cases under the Hague Convention that the court should refuse to order the 
immediate return of a child who has been wrongfully removed.<BR>As to the 
difficult problem of deciding whether a child is mature enough, Waite L.J. 
helpfully said in <I>re S (Minors) (Abduction: Acquiescence)</I> [1994] 1 FLR 
819, 827:-<BR>"When Art 13 speaks of an age and maturity level at which it is 
appropriate to take account of a child's views, the enquiry which it envisages 
is not restricted to a generalised appraisal of the child's capacity to form 
unexpressed views which bear the hallmark of maturity. It is permissible (and 
indeed will often be necessary) for the court to make specific enquiry as to 
whether the child has reached a stage of development at which, when asked the 
question "Do you object to a return to your home country?" he or she can be 
relied on to give an answer which does not depend upon instinct alone, but is 
influenced by the discernment which a mature child brings to the question's 
implications for his or her own best interests in the long and short 
term."<BR>Thus it seems to me that the matters to establish are:-<BR><B>1. 
</B>Whether the child objects to being returned to the country of habitual 
residence, bearing in mind that there may be cases where this is so inevitably 
and inextricably linked with an objection to living with the other parent that 
the two factors cannot be separated. Hence there is a need to ascertain why the 
child objects.<BR><B>2.</B> The age and degree of maturity of the child. Is the 
child more mature or less mature than or as mature as her chronological age? By 
way of example only, I note that in<I> re R (Child Abduction: Acquiescence)</I> 
[1995] 1FLR 716 Ewbank J's decision that boys aged 7½ and 6 were mature enough 
was upheld by Balcombe L.J. and Sir Ralph Gibson, Millett L.J. dissenting. I 
would not wish to venture any definition of maturity. Clearly the child has to 
know what has happened to her and to understand that there is a range of choice. 
A child may be mature enough for it to be appropriate for her views to be taken 
into account even though she may not have gained that level of maturity that she 
is fully emancipated from parental dependence and can claim autonomy of 
decision-making. The child's `right' - and I use the word loosely - is, 
consistently with Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a 
Child, to have the opportunity to express her views and to be heard, not a right 
to self-determination. Article 12, which is often judged to be one of the most 
important in that Convention, assures to children capable of forming their own 
views, :-<BR>"the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting 
(them), the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age 
and maturity of the child."<BR>The sentiments in both Conventions are the same 
and they give strong support to the idea that the purpose of the exception to 
the general rule of immediate return is to defer to the wishes of the child 
<I>for Convention purposes</I>, even if the child's wishes may not prevail if 
welfare were the paramount consideration. Thus once the child is judged to be of 
an age and maturity for it to be appropriate for the court to take account of 
her views then the Article 13 defence is established and the court moves to the 
separate exercise of discretion as it is required to be conducted under the 
Convention. Each case will, of course, depend upon its own facts. <BR><B>3.</B> 
So a discrete finding as to age and maturity is necessary in order to judge the 
next question which is whether it is a appropriate to take account of child's 
views. That requires an ascertainment of the strength and validity of those 
views which will call for an examination of the following matters, among 
others:-<BR><B>(a)</B> What is the child's own perspective of what is in her 
interests, short, medium and long term? Self-perception is important because it 
is <I>her</I> views which have to be judged appropriate.<BR><B>(b)</B> To what 
extent, if at all, are the reasons for objection rooted in reality or might 
reasonably appear to the child to be so grounded?<BR><B>(c)</B> To what extent 
have those views been shaped or even coloured by undue influence and pressure, 
directly or indirectly exerted by the abducting parent?<BR><B>(d)</B> To what 
extent will the objections be mollified on return and, where it is the case, on 
removal from any pernicious influence from the abducting parent?<BR><I>The 
approach of Court of Appeal to the judgment below</I><BR>If one is being 
pedantic, then whilst the question whether the child objects to being returned, 
is truly a matter of fact, as is the establishment of her age, it is more by an 
exercise of judgment, rather than by finding a fact, that the court proceeds to 
establish the degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of 
the child's views. If and insofar as this is an appeal against a value judgment, 
then the court will be slow to interfere unless it was satisfied that the judge 
was plainly wrong. <BR>The limitations on an appellate court's ability to review 
findings of fact are equally severe, and are well established. A passage from 
the speech of Lord Bridge of Harwich in <I>Whitehouse v Jordan </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/12.html">[1981] 1 WLR 246</a>, 269-270 is a good statement of our power:-<BR>"I recognise that this 
is a question of pure fact and that in the realm of fact, as the authorities 
repeatedly emphasise, the advantages which the judge derives from seeing and 
hearing witnesses must always be respected by an appellate court. At the same 
time the importance of the part played by those advantages in assisting the 
judge to any particular conclusion of fact varies through a wide spectrum from, 
at one end, a straight conflict of primary fact between witnesses, where 
credibility is crucial and the appellate court can hardly ever interfere, to at 
the other end, an inference from undisputed primary facts, where the appellate 
court is in just as good a position as the trial judge to make the 
decision."<BR>Here the judge had the advantage of hearing the court welfare 
officer, but the other evidence before him was documentary and we are in as good 
a position as he was to assess it. That said, however, it should never be 
forgotten that the United Kingdom takes its obligations under the Conventions so 
seriously that it is only the sixteen High Court judges of the Family Division 
who have the jurisdiction to try these abduction cases and consequently the 
views of a wise and experienced judge, as Wall J. certainly is, should never be 
lightly overruled. With that reminder firmly in mind, I turn to a close review 
of the evidence.<BR><I>The evidence</I><BR>It will be convenient to review the 
evidence chronologically. From the documents placed before us, some of which 
were not before the judge, the following picture emerges:-<BR>1. On 29 July 1998 
G made a declaration to the Spanish court. She referred to the incident when her 
mother threw her father's briefcase and papers into the swimming pool. I note 
that she does not mention her mother attacking her father with a baseball bat, 
which is an embellishment of the occasion in the account of it he gave us. She 
spoke of her mother becoming aggressive when under the influence of drink. She 
said that although she was not afraid of her mother, she was apprehensive at 
being left alone with her because she drank. <BR>2. On 26 September 1998 G made 
a statement to the <I>Guardia</I> <I>Civil</I> that her mother was drunk. This 
report was not before Wall J. <BR>3. A clinical report dated 1 December 1998 was 
among his papers but the judge did not refer to it in his judgment. It records 
that G attended the clinic in October 1997 "to evaluate her psychological state 
to see if the separation of the parents could have affected her." She was 
subjected to a personality test and interview and "it was concluded that the 
girl was intelligent, adaptable and able to cope with the problems between her 
parents." On that occasion she commented in the presence of her mother that she 
wished to remain with mother. She returned to the clinic in November 1998 at the 
request of the court. She was interviewed alone and said that she preferred 
living with her father because her mother was drinking frequently and becoming 
angry. She seems to have complained that her mother was increasingly resorting 
to alcohol so that she had decided she would be better off with her father. The 
report continued:-<BR>"From everything G referred to I understand she is under a 
lot of pressure from her mother, but is quite clear about not wanting to live 
with her, because according to what she says she does not feel safe and she is 
mistreated (insults and beatings) considering that she has got problems.<BR>The 
personality is evaluated again and one appreciates a change in the form of 
relating to others, <I>having matured, as she is no longer as submissive and 
introverted but more open and expansive which is why she has been able to talk 
about the problems which exist in her home at present.</I><BR>Because of all the 
aforementioned I consider G <I>to be capable of taking the decision of going to 
live with her father </I>but I lack objective information to validate what the 
girl is saying, although there are no reasons to doubt her."<BR>(I have added 
the emphasis) <BR>She was at that stage just short of her 10th birthday. On the 
face of it was a credible and rational account of her experiences. For reasons I 
shall give, I too have no reason to doubt her.<BR>4. On 30 December 1998 she 
told the judge, in the absence of her parents, that she loved them equally but 
preferred staying with her father and visiting her mother because of the 
problems her mother was having with alcohol. She complained that:-<BR>"Her 
mother, when she drinks, becomes violent and that sometimes she hits her, and 
that normally she drinks wine both in the mornings as well as in the evenings 
and that normally when they come from visiting her father her mother does not 
give them supper, and also leaves her brother sleeping on the sofa without 
taking him to bed. That often there is no food in the fridge, and that even now 
in winter her mother does not turn on any heater ... and that this problem has 
kept on since she was 4 years old."<BR>This was before Wall J. <BR>5. On 10 
February 1999 G again appeared before a judge in the presence of the Public 
Prosecutor. She denied that her father forced her to say that her mother drinks. 
Her mother said that if she continued saying that her mother drinks then all she 
would accomplish would be that she and her brother would be sent to an orphanage 
because her father was too old to care for her. Her mother also threatened to 
take her to England which caused her to cry thinking she would not see her 
father again. The statement concluded:-<BR>"She is tired of having to make so 
many declarations and repeating the same things to different people, that she 
does not want her declaration to be known, because her mother becomes angry when 
she finds out about them, that to sum up what she wants is to stay with her 
father."<BR>This was before Wall J.<BR>6. On 24 April 1999 she wrote two 
letters, not placed before the judge. In the first she wrote in Spanish to 
"Senora Fiscal" speaking again of her fear of being placed in a children's home. 
She said that her father had asked her to write the letter. The father did not 
deny that he did so but explained that he was being invited by the authorities 
to get G to put her complaint in writing. On the same day she wrote to Social 
Services International in London saying:-<BR>"When my mother is drunk she often 
falls onto the ground and cannot move. I'm frightened that this will happen when 
I cannot help her. I whant (sic) to live with my brother and father but the 
judge will not change the visiting. I love my mum but she cannot stop getting 
drunk and this is ruining our lives. Please do all you can to help. ... My dad 
has asked me to write this letter but says I must only write what is completely 
true and that I don't have to write anything at all if I don't want to. I am 
posting this myself."<BR>7. On 3 May, which is the occasion the mother admits 
becoming incapable, G appeared before the 1st Corporal of the Guardia stating 
she was afraid to return home for fear of reprisal from her mother for writing 
asking for more contact with her father. She complained that often in the 
evenings mother did not give them food, that she had to give her brother his 
bottle but she added that these events only happened when her mother was drunk 
and that when she was well she treated them correctly. She said she remembered 
her mother hitting her brother T but that was a long time ago in February. This 
report was before Wall J. It strikes me as a fair and balanced account with no 
hint of exaggeration. <BR>8. On 15 June 1999 she wrote to the Fiscal repeating 
the complaint of her mother's drunkenness. The father had a hand in writing this 
letter. It was not placed before the judge. <BR>9. On 13 September 1999 she 
appeared before the assistant to the Judicial Secretary repeating her wish to 
live with her father. The judge did not see this letter. <BR>10. In December she 
was seen by a psychologist and social worker for the purpose of preparing the 
psychological report. The judge recited their conclusions which were:-<BR>"The 
interviews with the social workers have shown that his (father's) opinion of his 
wife is very negative. He considers her "an incurable alcoholic". His opinion is 
projected onto the children, causing them to believe that their mother is unable 
to solve her problems or look after them properly as a result of this, they 
think less of their mother and this may have a negative effect on the normal 
development of the children. On the other hand, the father has emotional ties 
with the children, especially with G who idolises him. This appears to be 
influencing her desire to live with him, leading her to believe that his values 
are the only ones which count and to blame all the problems that have occurred 
in the family on her mother. All of this has affected G in particular, since she 
is heavily influenced by the father. This prevents her from forming her own 
opinion about the family's problems but also hinders any form of dialogue 
between G and her mother, which is of vital importance to ensure the girl's 
normal psychological and social development. For this reason we recommend that 
the girl receives psychological support that will mediate between mother and 
daughter in order to bring the two closer together. The mother, for her part, is 
conscious of her problem and has been receiving treatment at Prosalud since May. 
Her prognosis, as indicated in the enclosed report, is good. For the reasons 
stated above, we believe she is able to assume responsibility of her family and 
social life and to take physical custody of the children. Finally given the 
complex family situation and for the reasons stated above, we recommend that 
there should be a follow-up of the case by social services as a means of 
monitoring and supporting the maternal family unit."<BR>Wall J. said:-<BR>"The 
psychological report, as I have indicated, is in the papers and, in the light of 
the summary which I have read, I only propose to make brief references to 
it."<BR>11. He did not, therefore, expressly refer to the account of their 
examination of G. She said that her father had told her that her mother had 
suffered from her drink problem for a long time but that she had only seen it 
during the nine months she and her brother lived alone with their mother in 
Berja. During this time "it was OK in the mornings, she would get our breakfast 
and clothes ready, but when they returned from school in the afternoons their 
mother had been drinking and couldn't look after them." She stated that this was 
one of the reasons why she did not have many friends because everyone in the 
town knew about her mother's problems. <BR>The clinic conducted a psychological 
test with the following important result:-<BR>"The results of the test showed 
the basic structure of her personality "relaxed, <I>well-adjusted, 
extrovert.</I><BR>Significant factors or features of her personality: open, 
affectionate, and sociable. <I>Emotionally stable, calm and mature. Faces 
reality, responsible, persevering, natural, romantic, frank. </I>Socially 
gauche,<I> </I>relaxed, calm, not frustrated."<BR>(I have added the 
emphasis.)<BR>12. On 23 December 1999, that is two days after the court had 
ordered the father to return to their old home in Berja, G spoke to the judge in 
Albrox declaring that:-<BR>"My father has informed me of the order by the judge 
of Berja saying that we have to return to school there and that if this is not 
carried out, they would take from him the care and custody of my brother and me, 
and I have been told that if that happens, we would be sent to some kind of 
centre, or much worse to our mother. Which I do not wish to do under any 
circumstances, because of her problem with alcohol and because I have seen that 
she has gone back to drinking, which I saw last Sunday when she got drunk while 
we were with her. She was already drinking when we arrived in the morning. That 
we are very happy in the school in Albrox where I have many and good friends but 
that if the court of Berja does not leave us in peace both my brother and I (he 
has told me) preferred returning definitively to England."<BR>So much for Spain. 
Since her arrival in England the relevant events are:- <BR>1. G's letters to her 
mother: I referred at the beginning of this judgment to her letter of 1 
February. She wrote more recently on 23 March. Whereas the impression given by 
her first letter was, as the judge described it, "very sad", this one strikes me 
as being rather rude. She wrote:-<BR>"Dad says he has had a letter from your 
lawyer and you want me and T to go and stay with you at Carol's for a week end. 
No way. I don't want to see you even for a second until you stop trying to force 
us to go back to Spain. T knows your trying to take us away and he dosen't (sic) 
want to see you because of that. Why don't you ask us what we want instead of 
getting your lawyer to force us to see you. I suppose you will get the police to 
force us to see you like you did in Spain. Stop ruining our life we've had 
enough of that in Spain. We are happy in our new life here and if you like Spain 
so much, why don't you go back there and leave us alone. I'm sending this letter 
to your lawyer because the letter I sent to Carol's didn't get to 
you."<BR>Whether or not father prompted the letter, he certainly inappropriately 
referred to solicitors' correspondence addressed to him to his daughter and he 
has served to inflame her intransigence. <BR>2. The medical evidence is 
important. The judge surprisingly failed to deal with Dr McIver's letters of 10 
February addressed to the solicitors who were then acting for the father. It is 
necessary to quote from them fully. The first reads, with emphasis added by 
me:-<BR>"I was asked by G's father to see her because he was concerned about 
her. She had expressed to him great concern about possibly returning to live in 
Spain. She had made friends in England, was attending school and wished to 
remain here. <I>(The father) had given me much background information 
beforehand. </I><BR>On the evening of Wednesday 9 February 200 I spent 
approximately 30 minutes with G on her own while (the father) and T were in a 
waiting room. <BR>My impression is of an extremely unhappy child whose life is 
being manipulated in a way that is causing her great unhappiness and bodes ill 
for the future. She described to me some of her experiences in Spain, 
involvement with the legal profession, psychologists and councillors. <I>She 
appeared mature beyond her years with a considerable understanding of the adult 
way of life.</I> She expressed love for her mother but was vehemently opposed to 
be reunited under the present circumstances, expressing fears of retribution for 
the way she had been forced to act while in the custody of her mother. Her 
father told me that she had discussed suicide with him in Spain. Without 
dwelling on this I ascertained <I>that she really did not care whether she lived 
or died. She has no hope for the future and this caused me very great concern 
indeed.</I> Some of this child's description of her life should be categorised 
as emotional child abuse. I would very much hope that any decisions that may be 
taken concerning her future would also take into account her current medical 
condition as well as her future health and welfare. Without this consideration 
there is a very bleak future for her indeed. <BR>I had spoken briefly to T and 
will interviewing him at greater length and will be referring him for a 
paediatric psychiatric opinion in view of the turmoil he has experienced in his 
life so far. <I>One issue of great concern for G is that she will be forced to 
return as a result of T' young age or alternatively that they will be separated 
for ever.</I><BR>In my clinical opinion she requires urgent psychiatric 
assessment and assistance and I am setting this up as a matter of urgency with 
an appointment to see Dr Owen Delany ... ."<BR>The supplementary report of the 
same date reads:-<BR>"It is my clinical opinion as general practitioner that a 
psychiatrist's report will be necessary because I fear <I>there is a grave 
risk</I> that both<I> T </I>and G <I>will suffer psychological damage</I> if 
they are forced against their will to return to Spain. I spent thirty minutes 
with G on her own and formed the view that <I>despite her age she exhibits a 
maturity and understanding of the issues which is disturbing for me to see in 
someone so young. </I><BR>G fears sanctions because of the evidence that she has 
given at legal proceedings in Spain and feels that no one will listen to her or 
come to her help if the disasters that she fears do occur.<BR>G was forthright 
in her views that she really has nothing to look forward to in life if she is 
returned to Spain against her will to her mothers care. I touched on her further 
thoughts in view of the mention of suicidal tendency from her father. I was 
greatly concerned to hear her say that she did not really care whether she lived 
or died as she had no future." (Again I have added the emphasis)<BR>The judge 
did refer to the letter of the 17 February in which the doctor gave an oral 
report of Mr Middlecoat's opinion which is now set out in his written report 
dated 21 February which has been placed before us. He considered that:-<BR>"For 
an 11 year old child, G is clearly carrying an inappropriate level of 
responsibility for her own and her brother's future."<BR>He was very critical, 
and rightly so, of the father telling the children he would not be returning to 
Spain with them for that had "effectively increased her sense of helplessness 
about the whole situation." He concluded:-<BR>"At the time of this interview, G 
was not clinically depressed, although she was greatly affected by the ongoing 
court proceedings and the uncertainty over her future. She did not express any 
wish to hurt or harm herself, but did describe the present situation as being 
like a nightmare that she would like to wake up from. G is completely 
overwhelmed by the ongoing court process and her fear that both she and T will 
be returned to live with their mother in Spain ... G remains at a moderate to 
high risk of becoming more depressed until she is able to be an 11 year old girl 
again, with appropriate worries such as homework, school, exams etc."<BR>3. The 
judge had the advantage of hearing from the court welfare officer. When she said 
she would not express any contrary view to that contained in the psychological 
report, I do not know whether she was only referred to G's being under her 
father's influence or whether her attention was specifically directed to the 
psychological profile which, incidentally does not seem to me to differ much 
from her own views about the child's maturity.<BR>The father sought to place 
before us a report from Dr Delany, the consultant psychiatrist, but he did not 
see G and his report derives entirely from what Mr Middlecoat told him. It does 
not add much which is original.<BR>4. The father also introduced a letter dated 
8 March 200 from the headmaster of G's school. It reads:-<BR>"G is <I>a mature 
girl</I> who seems <I>quite capable of expressing her views and preferences. She 
seems to have a clear grasp of her present situation and appears able enough to 
give a considered opinion of what she would like to happen in the future." 
</I>(The emphasis is added by me.)<BR><I>The conclusions to draw from this 
evidence</I><BR>1. It has never been in issue that G objects to returning to 
Spain. It is an objection to returning to "that crummy little village in Spain 
where all my friends know how you keep getting drunk all the time." It is, of 
course, also an objection to returning to her mother's care because she cannot 
trust her mother to remain free from drink and because she fears for the 
upheaval to their domestic life when she is in drink. <BR>2. This is an 11 year 
old child found by the Spanish psychologists to have been mature when aged 
nearly 10 in December 1998 and again when aged nearly 11 in December 1999. The 
tenor of Dr McIver's report is that she is, if anything, mature beyond her years 
given the burdens she has had to carry. The court welfare officer found her to 
be mature. The headmaster of her school judged her in the same light. It seems 
to me, therefore, that the conclusion is irresistible that this child is not 
just of average maturity for her age, but mature beyond her years given the 
burdens she has had to carry. <BR>3. (a) This girl clearly perceives her mother 
to have a drink problem. She does not trust her. She fears for herself and for 
her brother if they return. She feels humiliated in the eyes of her friends at 
the local school who have knowledge of her mother's shortcomings and the scandal 
of police intervention. <BR>3(b) As to whether or not these complaints about her 
mother's behaviour and her fears for the future are rooted in reality, I 
conclude that there is a solid sub-stratum of truth and I shall explain shortly 
why I am of that view. <BR>3(c) I have no doubt that her views have been 
coloured and sharpened by her father's hostility. He has taken her to the 
authorities in Spain, and caused her to write of her complaints to the 
authorities there and to the mother's solicitors here. Nevertheless the 
consistency of her approach, the expressions of love for her mother and the 
heartfelt cry of her letter of 1 February convince me that her views are genuine 
and not simply nor even mainly the product of her father's obsession.<BR>3(d) 
The note of despair in her conversation with Dr McIver who had half an hour 
alone with her and the anger of her most recent letter to her mother satisfy me 
that her fears and anxieties will not evaporate upon her return to Spain. The 
Spanish psychological report itself recognised that she needed psychological 
support in order to bring mother and daughter closer together. Since then her 
hostility has increased.<BR>Looking at the whole of this evidence, including the 
considerable body of information about G's complaints to the Spanish authorities 
which Wall J. did not have the advantage of seeing, I come to the clear 
conclusion that this is a girl of an age and maturity which compels this court 
to take account of her views.<BR><I>The mother's conduct</I><BR>In her second 
affidavit sworn in answer to the father's first affidavit referring to her 
"persistent states of inebriation from alcoholism when she passes out in the 
street and at home", the mother said :-<BR>"I deny the assertion that I am a 
chronic alcoholic. ... I admit that I have had an occasional isolated problem 
relating to alcohol, but this is always a symptom of depression which has been 
brought on the defendant. I have never passed out in the streets or at my home 
and the children have not seen me in a state of inebriation from alcohol save on 
one occasion when I had a breakdown in May."<BR>This, on all the evidence, 
including her own, is a less than frank statement. Prosalud, an officially 
accredited centre for the treatment and prevention of alcoholism reported on 20 
December 1999 that:-<BR>"At present she has been dried out ... She realises that 
she was abusing alcohol ... She is able to take charge of her emotional and 
family life."<BR>Interviewed by the psychologist for the psychological report 
prepared for the December 1999 hearing she said tellingly:-<BR>"Her drink 
problem began five years ago ... (as) an unconscious response to "a situation in 
which you can't see any way out of what's happening". She said she did not have 
a drink problem at the daily level and could drink in moderation for long 
periods of time."<BR>To me the saddest but most revealing aspect of that report 
is this:-<BR>"She feels responsible for the situation she put her children in 
and said that she now wants to "show G that she can solve her problem", that she 
is not a weak woman, that she worked and fought for her living in London and 
that she has the mental strength to resolve her problem."<BR>That is a very 
frank admission of her predicament and of her need to put things right between 
her and her daughter. It gives credence to the gist of what G has been saying 
consistently for a very long time. It destroys the notion that G's problems are 
the creation of her father's hostility.<BR><I>The Article 13 defence based on 
G's objections to returning to Spain</I><BR>I am totally satisfied that this 
defence is made out and the judge was wrong to conclude otherwise. <BR><I>The 
exercise of discretion</I><BR>That there is a discretion is plain from the 
Article itself which provides that notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12 
which require in mandatory terms that the child wrongfully abducted be returned, 
the court "may also refuse to order the return" if there is a valid objection by 
the child. In <I>re R (Child Abduction: Acquiescence)</I> [1995] 1 FLR 716, 734, 
Millett L.J. said, and this seems to be with the agreement of Sir Ralph 
Gibson,:-<BR>"It is to be observed that, if a child is <I>not </I>of an age and 
degree of<I> </I>maturity<I> </I>which makes it appropriate to take his views 
into account, he <I>must</I> be returned despite his objections and without any 
further inquiry whether his return is in his best interests. If, on the other 
hand, he <I>is</I> of sufficient age and maturity for his views to be taken into 
account, the Convention clearly envisages that he will<I> not </I>be returned 
against his<I> </I>wishes, unless there<I> </I>countervailing factors which 
require his wishes to be overridden."<BR>I am inclined to agree with that 
observation and it may not be necessary to express a definitive conclusion about 
it. In this case the only factors which are to be placed in the balance against 
return are:-<BR>1. The spirit and purpose of the Convention which is to leave it 
to the courts of habitual residence to resolve the parental dispute. As the<I> 
forum conveniens</I>, the claim for Spain to resolve the children's future is 
overwhelming.<BR>2. The abducting parent should not be permitted to create the 
situation which makes it possible to raise an Article 13 defence. That is not 
this case. The father's decision not to return to Spain has undoubtedly 
compounded G's unhappiness and he is rightly censured for this. It may have 
strengthened G's resolve, but even without it the foundation for her objection 
remains firm.<BR>In the last analysis, the balance is between allowing the girl 
her Article 13 defence or enforcing the spirit of the Convention despite the 
Article 13 defence. In my judgment, the demands of comity, convenience and even 
the welfare of the child in having her future decided in the court of her 
habitual residence, do not override the respect which should be paid to her 
wishes in this particular case. Looking at her case in isolation and without 
reference to T's, I would not order her return. <BR><I>The claim for the return 
of T</I><BR>There is no authority binding upon us to which we have been referred 
by Mr Setright, a great expert in these matters, or which I have been able to 
discover in the course of my research under pressure of time. This is the state 
of the law so far as I have been able to discover it. <BR><I></I>In <I>B v K 
(Child Abduction)</I> [1993] 1 F.C.R. 382, decided by Johnson J. in October 
1991, three children were removed from Germany. The judge held that a girl 
nearly 9 and a boy aged 7 had attained an age and a degree of maturity at which 
it was appropriate for him to take account of their views. In the exercise of 
his discretion he concluded it would be wrong for the two older children to be 
returned to Germany even though the abducting parent was "getting away with it". 
With regard to the youngest child he said at p. 387/8:-<BR>"The youngest child, 
is not, in my judgment, of an age and degree of maturity in which I should take 
account of his views, so that it seems to me that this basis of objection by the 
mother, which I have upheld in relation to the two elder children, cannot be 
upheld in relation to the youngest child, so I find myself, at least initially, 
in the position where I would not order the return of the two elder children to 
Germany but that I would find there to be no sustainable objection to the return 
of the youngest child. However, it is plain that these children have always 
lived together, and I accept the statement in his oral report this morning from 
(the court welfare officer) that the youngest child would be devastated to be 
separated from the two elder children. Accordingly, whilst I have rejected the 
mother's case on the other part of Article 13 namely that the children would 
suffer psychological or physical harm or be placed in an intolerable situation, 
I have no difficulty in holding that the youngest child would be exposed to 
psychological harm and would be placed in an intolerable situation if he were 
returned to Germany and the elder two children were not. Accordingly, it falls 
to me exercise the discretion conferred on me by the opening words of Article 
13, and by that circuitous route I conclude that the youngest child shall not be 
returned to Germany."<BR>In <I>The Ontario Court v M &amp; M (Abduction: 
Children's objections) </I>[1997] 1 FLR 475, Hollis J. in June 1996 the judge 
was satisfied that he should take into account the objections of a girl not 
quite 10 years old to returning to Ontario. He held at p. 485 that:-<BR>"In the 
absence of any medical evidence I do not think it right to find a grave risk of 
exposing the children to psychological harm by returning them, despite the 
persuasive comments of the senior court welfare officer, but I do find a grave 
risk if returned of placing (the elder girl) in an intolerable situation. It is 
not submitted that the two children should be treated differently, and, if need 
be, split apart from one another. Therefore in the exercise of my discretion, 
and relying on (the girl's) varied objections to returning to Ontario, and a 
grave risk of such a return placing her in an intolerable situation, I decline 
to order the return of the children to Ontario."<BR>The other child was 2½ years 
old.<BR>Next is the quite extraordinary case of <I>Re H B (Abduction: Children's 
objections)</I> [1997] 1 FLR 392 decided by Hale J. in October<I> </I>1996. The 
children were a boy aged 13 and a girl aged 11 who had come from Denmark to 
visit their father. The judge concluded that the views of both children should 
be taken into account. She was thus required to exercise her discretion whether 
or not to return. The judge said this:-<BR>"The policy of the Convention is, in 
my view, particularly important in cases where children come to another country 
for visits. It is obviously in the best interests of children whose parents live 
in separate countries that the parent with whom they live should feel able to 
send them on visits secure in the knowledge that the children will be returned 
at the end without difficulty. Otherwise parents may be tempted not to allow the 
children to come, and that would be detrimental to the children. <BR>In the case 
of C (the younger girl) I do not think that the real strength of her objections, 
the reasons for them and the evidence of relationships at home are enough to set 
against that policy. Furthermore there is no question in my mind that C's visit 
was always intended as a short-term holiday visit. <BR>The case of A (the older 
boy) is more difficult. He is older, he is more mature, he has stronger and, to 
my mind quite rational objections. The evidence is that the mother herself is in 
doubt about what to do for the best. <BR>So what about treating the children 
separately? Mr McDowall, on behalf of the father argues that if C is ordered to 
return but A is not, C will suffer psychological harm from being separated from 
her brother. Their relationship was described by the court welfare officer as 
"significant, intimate, relaxed".<BR>(Reference was made to <I>B v K</I>, above 
and the judge continued.) In this case I do not think that that will be 
sufficient to amount to a grave risk of psychological harm or will otherwise 
place C in an intolerable position. She would be going back to a primary carer 
whom she loved. <BR>More to the point, therefore, is the conclusion that there 
is no good ground to refuse to return C a further reason for returning A as 
well? I have found this a very difficult decision, but I have reluctantly come 
to the conclusion that it is and that A should be returned."<BR>The case had a 
most unusual outcome. When the children were taken to the airport by their 
father, it was ironically A who was willing to board the plane and return to 
Denmark but C adamantly refused to do so. C was then allowed to intervene and 
appealed to the Court of Appeal who remitted the case back to Hale J: see [1998] 
1 FLR 422. Given the passage of time Hale J. eventually dismissed the Hague 
Convention proceedings and dealt with the matter in wardship: see<I> </I>[1998] 
1 FLR 564. <BR>The Court of Appeal has twice had to consider the matter where 
there were other children of half-blood to the children, the subject of the 
application. The first is <I>Re C (Abduction: Grave Risk of Psychological 
Harm)</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/5.html">[1991] 1</a> FLR 1145 involving a boy aged 9½ and a girl aged 8 removed 
from California by their mother. After the parents had separated the mother 
entered into a new relationship and had a baby daughter who was a year old. 
Their problem was that the new baby's father had a criminal record which would 
prevent his re-entry to the United States of America. Connell J. held there was 
a grave risk of psychological harm should the two children be returned. The 
mother's case was that she was faced with the terrible dilemma of having to 
choose between sending the children back without her, which she said would 
subject them to harm, or splitting her new family. In allowing the appeal, I 
said at p.1156:-<BR>"That the family might be split was a matter which was or 
ought to have been known to them and it was a factor which, if they had given 
full and frank disclosure of their position, ought to have been revealed to the 
Californian court and to the father at the time they sought permission for their 
purported holiday. ... They should not have embarked upon a "Xmas visit" from 
which the family could not return intact. By their own actions they created the 
adverse conditions upon which they now seek to rely."<BR>I was applying the 
approach laid down in <I>Re C (A Minor) (Abduction)</I> [1989] 1 FLR 403 where 
Butler-Sloss L.J. spoke of the parent who created a psychological situation and 
then sought to rely upon it not being permitted to drive a coach and four 
through the Convention. I added at p. 1145:-<BR>"There is, therefore, an 
established line of authority that the court should require clear and compelling 
evidence of the grave risk of harm or other intolerability which must be 
measured as substantial, not trivial, and of a severity which is more than is 
inherent in the inevitable disruption, uncertainty and anxiety which follows an 
unwelcome return to the jurisdiction of the court of habitual 
residence."<BR>Having decided that the mother had no Article 13(b) defence, 
there was in fact no discretion to exercise. Article 12 bit. We had to order the 
return of the children forthwith and did so with what, I hope, was a rallying 
cry to the judges of the Family Division vigorously to uphold the purpose of the 
Convention which is to send the children back and not to usurp the function of 
the court of habitual residence. <BR>Next case is another <I>Re C</I>, this time 
<I>Re C (Abduction: Grave Risk of Physical or Psychological Harm) </I>[1999] 2 
FLR 478. An English mother wrongfully removed her child, B, a boy aged 6 from 
Cyprus and returned to this country bringing with her her 14½ year old daughter, 
A, a child by a previous relationship. On B's father's application under the 
Convention for B's return, A adamantly refused to go back to Cyprus. The 
children were said to be very close. The mother set up an Article 13(b) defence. 
Butler-Sloss L.J. said at p.480:-<BR>"The mother's reliance is based upon grave 
risk that B's return would expose him either to psychological harm or otherwise 
place him in an intolerable situation. Both those situations are based on the 
result of her flight from Cyprus to England. A is at the centre of the problem 
and of the mother's defence, although, in any event, the mother does not want to 
live in or go back to Cyprus. <BR>...<BR>The mother's case is therefore that A 
will not go back ... . The mother is in an impossible position and cannot leave 
her behind. But if she did leave her behind and go with B to Cyprus she would be 
consumed with guilt; the children would be separated and either way B would be 
placed in a situation which comes within Art. 13(b). (At p.481C)"<BR>That 
defence succeeded in the court below but the appeal was allowed. Butler-Sloss 
L.J. observed:-<BR>"(At p.484): The circumstances of this case provide a good 
example of how easily problems which arise in many child abduction cases caused 
by the actions of the abducting parent can be demonstrated by that parent to 
come within Art. 13(b) and thereby frustrate a return under Art. 
12.<BR>...<BR>(At p.486): <I>Re C (A Minor) (Abduction)</I> [1989] 1 FLR 403 
gives powerful support to the submissions of Mr Setright that too much weight 
had been given by the judge to the self-induced dilemma of this mother. 
...<BR>The position of A is a relevant factor in the case to which the court has 
to have regard. But the mother had the opportunity to consider the implications 
of returning to England with both children. <I>On the facts of this case</I> I 
do not consider that the consequences of that return on A should deflect the 
court from concentrating on the right of B to have his future decided in the 
State of his habitual residence." (my emphasis added)<BR>Thorpe L.J. added this 
at p.487-8:-<BR>"In many cases a balanced analysis of the assertion that an 
order for return would expose the child to the grave risk of psychological harm 
leads to the conclusion that the respondent is in reality relying upon her own 
wrongdoing in order to build up the statutory defence. In testing the validity 
of an Article 13(b) defence, trial judges should usefully ask themselves what 
were the intolerable features of the child's family life immediately prior to 
the wrongful abduction? If the answer be scant or non-existent, then the 
circumstances in which an article 13(b) defence would be upheld are difficult to 
hypothesise. In my opinion Article 13(b) is given its proper construction if 
ordinarily confined to meet the case where the mother's motivation for flight is 
to remove the child from a family situation which is damaging the child's 
development."<BR><I>An application of these authorities</I><BR>I confess I do 
not find it easy to extract a great deal of certain principle from these cases. 
We have hardly had the benefit of full argument. The matter was only addressed 
by Mr Setright because I asked about T's position. The matter does not much 
feature in his skeleton arguments either here or below. The father is in person 
and was quite unable to assist. It was quite clear to us that neither parent had 
confronted the possibility of splitting the children. I earlier emphasised how 
the judge posed the question asking whether he should decline to return G and 
<I>as a consequence T</I> because of her objection. It reads as if he assumed 
that the question of their respective returns stood or fell together. That is 
hardly a surprising assumption to make. There does appear to be something odd 
about refusing to return an elder child who is old enough to articulate an 
objection to return because of fears expressed for herself <I>and for her 
younger sibling</I> because of what had happened to them without also inferring 
that if the younger was of an age and maturity where he had voice and vote, he 
would echo the objection and vote with his elder sister. That said, I recognise 
that we must now to proceed upon a basis that T is too young and immature for 
his views to be taken into account and that, accordingly, a defence under 
Article 13(b) must be established with regard to him. If it is not, he must be 
returned. There would then be no discretion to order otherwise. I am also 
prepared to accept that in that event the fact of his return may be a factor to 
bring into balance in exercising a discretion whether or not, despite G's 
objections, she should go back.<BR><I>The Article 13(b) defence with regard to 
T</I> <BR>So sharp has been the focus on G that very little evidence has been 
directed to T. The material information is limited to this, as it seems to 
me:<BR>1. The psychological assessment conducted in December 1999 says 
this:-<BR>"During the interview with the child he was inhibited and shy, and was 
not very expressive and was sad. Drawing of a human figure showed immaturity in 
the co-ordination of his visual and motor skills, as he produced a drawing that 
was difficult to execute; this may indicate emotional problems and learning 
problems at school. He wants to stay with his father, but is not able to say 
why, "he thinks his father takes better care"."<BR>2. Dr McIver wrote on 10 
February:-<BR>"I spoke briefly to T and will be interviewing him at greater 
length and will be referring him for a paediatric psychiatric opinion in view of 
the turmoil that he has experience in his life so far. One issue of great 
concern for G is that she will be forced to return as a result of T's young age 
or alternatively that they will be separated for ever."<BR>(There is no 
psychiatric opinion because Bennett J. refused to permit the child to be 
referred.) In his second letter he linked the children, saying:-<BR>"I fear 
there is a grave risk that both T and G will suffer psychological damage if they 
are forced against their will to return to Spain. "<BR>3. Mr Middlecoat reported 
that:-<BR>"For an 11 year old child, G is clearly carrying an inappropriate 
level of responsibility for her own and her brother's future."<BR>4. G's own 
explanation of life with mother contains statements of how she (G) had to look 
after her brother due to her mother's incapacity through drink to do so. Hence 
the description is given of G as "little mother" to T.<BR>Wall J. considered 
Article 13(b) on the basis that both children would be returned and held, not 
surprisingly, that in the light of the findings of the Spanish court that mother 
could cope, a finding of grave risk of psychological or physical harm "did not 
get off the ground." He did not postulate T being sent back alone. <BR>In both 
cases which have come to the Court of Appeal, the abducting parent was not able 
to run the defence because that would be to take advantage of her own wrong. 
That, however, is not this case, and the distinction is important. The father is 
not saying that T will suffer because <I>he (the father)</I> will not return to 
Spain and that T will suffer through missing <I>him</I>, though undoubtedly he 
will. The harm T will suffer or the intolerable situation in which he will be 
placed arises from the fact that his <I>sister</I> will not go with him. The 
father has not by his wrongful removal of the children created the situation 
which leads to her refusal to return. Her refusal is founded on her mother's 
conduct and the exercise by her of her `right' to object. Her perception is that 
neither herself nor T should be expected to return to "a family situation that 
is damaging to the child's development", adapting Thorpe L.J.'s words in 
<I>C</I>. <BR>As Butler-Sloss L.J. implicitly acknowledged in that case, each 
case depends upon its own facts and circumstances. This case can easily be 
distinguished from that because the children are of full blood, not half blood 
and the father's refusal to return does not create the intolerable situation for 
T.<BR>Thus the question resolves into whether or not this court can find that, 
even though T would not be at grave risk of exposure to physical or 
psychological harm because the Spanish court have found upon the merits that, 
whatever the mother's past failings, she is currently capable of discharging her 
responsibilities properly, nevertheless there is a grave risk that to return T 
without his sister would place him in an intolerable situation.<BR>That requires 
no less stringent a test than the rest of Article 13(b). The evidence before us 
undoubtedly is limited but it is nevertheless in my judgment sufficiently clear 
and compelling to cross the high threshold and to drive me to the conclusion 
that we would be placing T in an intolerable situation if we were to send him 
back alone. He and his sister have lived through difficult days together. He has 
been dependant upon his sister. At times she has been his "little mother". To 
separate them would produce an intolerable situation for him. In the quite 
exceptional circumstances of this case I find that the Article 13(b) defence is 
established. <BR><I>The exercise of discretion</I><BR>The main arguments for his 
return would be to give effect to the spirit of the Convention, and to 
acknowledge that the Spanish court is best in a position to decide his future. 
They are the important considerations of comity and convenience. These are very 
powerful factors but in my judgment they cannot prevail against the 
intolerability of T's situation. <BR>The exercise of discretion must be taken in 
the round and I accept that it may be appropriate therefore to ask whether G's 
objections should be overridden to remove the intolerability T would face 
returning alone, thus enabling his future to be determined where it should be, 
in Spain. Once again, in my judgment, upholding the spirit of the Convention is 
too high a price for these children to pay.<BR><I>Conclusion</I><BR>Not without 
considerable hesitation, I conclude that the Hague Convention application for 
the return of these children must be dismissed. <BR><I>The claim under the 
European Convention</I><BR>Article 4(1) provides:-<BR>"Any person who has 
obtained in a contracting State a decision relating to the custody of a child 
and who wishes to have that decision recognised or enforced in another 
contracting State may submit an application for this purpose to the central 
authority in any contracting State."<BR>If the order is registered, then under 
Article 5(1):-<BR>"The central authority in the State addressed shall take or 
cause to be taken without delay all steps which it considers to be appropriate, 
if necessary by instituting proceedings before its competent authorities, in 
order:<BR>... <BR>(c) to secure the recognition or enforcement of the decision; 
<BR>(d) to secure the delivery of the child to the applicant where enforcement 
is granted."<BR>For present purposes I am prepared to assume that the order of 7 
February is an order capable of recognition and enforcement. Article 10 provides 
grounds for refusing to do so and they include:-<BR>"(b) If it is found that by 
reason of a change in the circumstances including the passage of time but not 
including a mere change in the residence of the child after an improper removal, 
the effects of the original decision are manifestly no longer in accordance with 
the welfare of the child; <BR>(c) if at the time when the proceeding were 
instituted in the State of origin:<BR>(i) the child was a national of the State 
addressed or was habitually resident there and no such connection existed with 
the State of origin;<BR>(ii) the child was a national both of the State of 
origin and of the State addressed and was habitually resident in the State 
addressed." <BR>I am not prepared to find that the original decision is 
manifestly no longer in accordance with the welfare of the child because we have 
hardly started upon an enquiry of the merits as to where the welfare of the 
children truly lies. It seems to me, however, that there can be no answer to 
ground (c). G was born in this country and although T was born abroad the 
parents registered his birth at the British Embassy and he is a British citizen 
and thus "a national of the State addressed". The importance of enforcing the 
orders of the courts of habitual residence after having determined disputed 
custody issues is as weighty a factor under this Convention as returning the 
children is under the Hague Convention. Nevertheless, in the particular and 
exceptional circumstances of this case, the interests of the children in 
remaining here should not be sacrificed on the altar of comity between nation 
States. Consequently I would dismiss that 
application.<BR><I>Conclusions</I><BR>I very much hope these findings will not 
be thought to be any affront to the Spanish court. The task upon which it was 
engaged, as set out in the first paragraph of its decision of 7<SUP>th</SUP> 
February, was to give effect to `the supremacy of the interest of the minor over 
any other legitimate interest'. Our judgment is not to be seen as any attack 
whatsoever on the correctness of their decision. We have not conducted an 
enquiry into the question with whom the children should live when the welfare of 
the children would have been our paramount consideration. Indeed Article 19 
makes it clear that we do not approach the case looking at the merits because, 
as the Article provides :-<BR>"A decision under this Convention concerning the 
return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of 
any custody issue."<BR>So far as G is concerned, the Spanish court itself 
concluded that "there is a doubt as to how to evaluate her wishes." We were 
required by Article 13 to resolve those doubts in the changed circumstances of 
the family. The Spanish court will therefore understand that in coming to our 
conclusion, we were giving effect to paragraph 30 of the Explanatory Report to 
the Convention by Professor Elisa Perez-Vera who said:-<BR>"In addition, the 
Convention also provides that the child's views concerning the essential 
question of its return or retention may be conclusive, provided it has, 
according to the competent authorities, attained an age and degree of maturity 
sufficient for its views to be taken into account. In this way the Convention 
gives children the possibility of interpreting their own interests"<BR>In T's 
case, it will readily be appreciated that there is a huge difference between 
deciding whether he would be placed in an intolerable situation were he to be 
returned alone and with whom he and his elder sister together should live. 
<BR>Having emphasised that we have not been looking at the merits, it is now 
time that this should be done, and with expedition. It may be that the mother 
will establish her case that she now fit enough to have care of her children. In 
any event it is important that her contact to them be decided. She has for too 
long been denied that contact and it is becoming urgent that the court decides 
what visiting or staying contact she should have. (Both parents and particularly 
G should note that in my opinion -which of course will not bind the judge 
hearing the matter - the only question is <I>what </I>contact, not <I>whether 
</I>there should be contact. The time has come to mend the broken bridges in 
this family and as the strong man in this family the father has responsibility 
to begin the process of reconciliation for otherwise he does his children a 
grave disservice. He must mark my words.) I would have thought that the 
appropriate course would be for the mother to undertake to institute wardship 
proceedings so that we can give an indication of the directions we would invite 
the High Court judge to consider making which would include our inviting the 
Official Solicitor to act as guardian <I>ad</I> <I>litem</I> for both children 
so that their voices can be independently heard in what is and will remain a 
difficult case.<BR>For the reasons I have given at this regrettable great 
length, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the mother' s applications under 
both the Hague Convention and the European Convention.<BR><B>Lord Justice 
Sedley:</B><BR>With the very greatest reluctance I concur in the outcome 
proposed by Lord Justice Ward. As the decision of Mr Justice Wall illustrates, 
the United Kingdom's courts have a creditable record of abiding conscientiously 
by the Hague Convention. In particular our courts do not allow parents to reap 
the fruits of abduction by placing reliance on the situation which they 
themselves have unlawfully brought about. In large part that is exactly what is 
happening here: it is only by defying the Spanish courts that the father has 
been able to establish the children in a new home and schools where, no doubt, 
they are now secure and relatively content and well on the way to complete 
alienation from their mother. <BR>What makes it worse is that the Spanish courts 
have visibly gone about their task in a manner, and on the basis of legal 
principles, which are beyond criticism from an English juridical standpoint. 
There is and has been no good reason why the father should not press his claims 
there; but he has in effect boycotted the process, refusing among other things 
to speak to a Spanish psychologist because of assumed language difficulties - 
and this in the country which he has chosen for his and his children's habitual 
residence.<BR>But just as the Hague Convention ordinarily makes return 
inevitable under Article 12 if it is sought reasonably promptly, so Article 13 
creates an exception in the child's own interests if, among other things, the 
child opposes return and is old and mature enough to have her views taken into 
account. Even then, the child's views are not determinative: the final decision 
as to return must be the court's own.<BR>Moreover, none of the factors which 
affect G's possible return affect T. If he were the only child, return would be 
inevitable. But it is equally plain that to split the children up would be 
indefensible. It has to follow, for the reasons explained by Lord Justice Ward, 
that G's fate will be T's. <BR>There is no shadow of doubt that the father has 
played a conscious role in alienating the children from their mother, both 
before and after the abduction. The mother for her part has tried, but with less 
success, to do the opposite. But there comes a point at which, for better or for 
worse, an intelligent and articulate child's views, whatever their genesis, have 
to be taken for what they are - and the views of G, who at 11 is perceptibly 
both intelligent and articulate, are now made disturbingly apparent by the 
letter she wrote to her mother on 1 February 2000, about 4 weeks after the 
abduction to England and which Ward LJ has quoted in full.<BR>This is not the 
work of a child whose mind has simply been poisoned, though her father has 
played a sedulous part in shaping her views; nor does the letter itself show any 
obvious sign of being written under dictation or pressure from the father, 
though it will certainly have had his tacit or overt encouragement. It is the 
work, in my view, of a child made shrewd beyond her years by parental warfare 
and family breakdown, who detects in her mother's behaviour the pathos and 
shifting of a defeated woman. I have great sympathy for the mother, with all her 
failings, and none for the father, who seems to me a calculating individual 
accustomed to getting his own way and not too concerned who gets hurt in the 
process. His instrumentality in trying to use G to put his case to this court is 
only one instance. Another is the ingratiating letter by which - improperly, as 
he must know - he has sought after the conclusion of the hearing to bolster his 
case to the court. It is the doctor to whom the father took G and whom the 
father briefed about the situation who described what G had been put through as 
emotional child abuse.<BR>But none of this is what Article 13, or for that 
matter <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s1.html">section 
1</A> of the <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children 
Act 1989</A>, places centre stage. For better or for worse, G's clear and 
reasoned objection to return brings her, and by extension T, within Article 13 
exception.<BR>What is to follow is almost equally unsatisfactory. The courts of 
this country must now decide what is best for the children's future, for the 
parents show no sign whatever of negotiating a truce for the children's sake. 
The father may now risk punishment if he returns to Spain - a handicap of his 
own making but one which he will no doubt advance as a further reason for 
keeping the children here. He has already placed intolerable stress on the 
children by telling them that he will not visit them if they return to Spain. 
The mother, who has her own reasons for not wanting to return to live in 
England, is likely, and with good reason, to want the Spanish court's order 
respected. The Spanish court for its part will wonder what the point was of its 
work and of the Hague Convention. I hope that it will understand that we have 
sought loyally to abide by our treaty obligations, but that we are now 
confronted with a crystallisation of G's feelings about living with her mother 
which was not available to the Spanish court nor, in significant measure, to Mr 
Justice Wall, and which we are obliged to take into account.<BR>It will not help 
to add further to the comprehensive exposition by Lord Justice Ward of the 
reasons why G's objections as they can now be perceived compel this court to 
over set the painstaking and humane decision of Mr Justice Wall.<BR><B>LORD 
JUSTICE SIMON BROWN:</B><BR>I agree with both judgments.
