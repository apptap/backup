  <P><B>LADY JUSTICE HALE:</B> </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>This is an appeal against an order made by HHJ 
  O'Rorke in the Leicester County Court on 22 September 2000. He dismissed the 
  appellant's appeal, brought under section 204 of the Housing Act 1996, against 
  the decision of the respondent local authority dated 9 August 2000. The 
  authority had held that the appellant had become intentionally homeless and 
  accordingly they had no duty to provide her with accommodation under section 
  193 of the Act. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>Technically therefore this is a second appeal within 
  the meaning of section 55(1) of the Access to Justice Act 1999. This applies 
  'Where an appeal is made to a county court or to the High Court in relation to 
  any matter, and on hearing the appeal the court makes a decision in relation 
  to that matter . . ., ' which clearly covers this case: see <I>Azimi v London 
  Borough of Newham</I>, (2001) 33 HLR 569. This is somewhat surprising, as the 
  section was more obviously aimed at cases where there had already been one 
  appeal from a judicial determination, and not, as here, at cases where there 
  was an appeal from an administrative decision. Nevertheless, the consequence 
  is that, ' ... no appeal may be made to the Court of Appeal from that decision 
  unless the Court of Appeal considers that (a) the appeal would raise an 
  important point of principle or practice, or (b) there is some other 
  compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it.' Mantell LJ gave 
  permission to appeal on 8 December 2000. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>This case clearly does raise an important point of 
  principle under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Act 1996: may a 
  local housing authority have regard, among other things, to the availability 
  of other remedies, both legal and practical, when determining whether it is 
  probable that domestic violence will result from the continued occupation of 
  accommodation? </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The law</B></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>The question arises in this way. Section 175(1) of 
  the Housing Act 1996, provides that a person is homeless if he has no 
  accommodation available to him which he has a right to occupy. Section 175(3) 
  however qualifies this: 'A person shall not be treated as having accommodation 
  unless it is accommodation which it would be reasonable for him to continue to 
  occupy'. Section 177(1) provides as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'It is not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy 
    accommodation if it is probable that this will lead to domestic violence 
    against him, or against – 
    <P></P>
    <P></P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a person who normally resides with him as a member of his 
      family, or
      <P></P>
      <P>(b) any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with 
      him.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>For this purpose "domestic violence", in relation to a person, means </P>
    <P>violence from a person with whom he is associated, or threats of</P>
    <P>violence from such a person which are likely to be carried out.' 
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>The definition of 'associated person' in section 178(1) includes '(b) 
  cohabitants or former cohabitants.'</P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>It is common ground between Mr Luba QC, for the 
  appellant, and Mr Arden QC, for the respondent, that section 177(1) applies a 
  different test of reasonableness in domestic violence cases from that which 
  applies in other cases. In other cases, the question of whether or not it is 
  reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation which is available 
  to him is at large. The authority may take any relevant circumstances into 
  account. Under section 177(2), 'regard may be had to the general circumstances 
  prevailing in relation to housing in the district of the local housing 
  authority to whom he has applied for accommodation or for assistance in 
  obtaining accommodation.' As Mr Arden put it, people are not expected to put 
  up with domestic violence because there is a housing shortage in the area. In 
  domestic violence cases, the authority must apply the probability test in 
  section 177(1) and cannot take other matters into account. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>This distinction is supported, as Mr Luba points 
  out, by section 177(3). Paragraph (a) permits the Secretary of State, by 
  order, to specify 'other circumstances in which it <I>is to be</I> regarded as 
  reasonable or not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation' 
  (emphasis supplied). He has not so far supplemented the rule in section 
  177(1). Paragraph (b) permits the Secretary of State, by order, to specify 
  'other matters to be taken into account or disregarded in determining whether 
  it would be, or would have been, reasonable for a person to continue to occupy 
  accommodation.' To date, he has supplemented section 177(2) by specifying 
  affordability for that purpose. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>The authority's duties differ according to whether a 
  person is homeless intentionally (s 190), not in priority need but not 
  homeless intentionally (s 192), or in priority need and not homeless 
  intentionally (s 193). Under section 191(1), </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'A person becomes homeless intentionally if he deliberately does 
    or fails to do anything in consequence of which he ceases to occupy 
    accommodation which is available for his occupation and which it would have 
    been reasonable for him to continue to occupy.' </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>Mr Arden also accepts that the rule in section 
  177(1) is as applicable to the reasonableness requirement in section 191(1) as 
  it is to the equivalent requirement in section 175(3). This must be right as a 
  matter of logic and common sense. It is also supported by the reference to 
  'would have been reasonable to continue to occupy' in section 177(3)(b), which 
  must relate to a person who has already left. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>Also relevant are the authority's duty under section 
  184 to make inquiries into individual cases and under section 182 to 'have 
  regard' to guidance given by the Secretary of State in the exercise of their 
  functions relating to homelessness and the prevention of homelessness. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The facts</B></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>The appellant was born on 25 December 1978. She 
  has two children, Justin and Kyle, who were born in December 1995 and December 
  1996 and thus aged 4 and 3 in August 2000 (when the decision in question was 
  made). Their father is Mr Martin O'Neill. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>The appellant lived at 28 Edmonton Road between 27 
  July 1995 and 17 March 1997. She left because it was too small and damp (one 
  notes that both children were born during her occupation of this property). 
  She then lived at 13 Northfields Road until 18 August 1997 but left due to 
  racial harassment. Between 6 October 1997 and 20 April 1998 she lived at 205 
  Belgrave Boulevard but left because of domestic violence from Mr O'Neill. 
  Between 1 June 1998 and March 1999 she had accommodation at 25 Collett Road 
  but left during that time, again because of domestic violence from Mr O'Neill. 
  On 18 January 1999 she was rehoused at 18 Appleby Close, Kirby Firth, 
  Leicester, as an assured tenant of the De Montfort Housing Association. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>She left Appleby Close in July 1999. According to 
  the review decision letter of 9<SUP>th</SUP> August 2000: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'Shortly after Miss Bond took up occupation of 18 Appleby Close 
    contact with Mr O'Neill was resumed and although there was no difficulty at 
    the beginning problems arose as Mr O'Neill began to refuse to leave the 
    property when asked. If Miss Bond complained there would be aggression from 
    Mr O'Neill and according to Miss Bond on at least one occasion he assaulted 
    her by pushing her up against the wall and slapping her repeatedly. 
    Following the assault Miss Bond refused to let Mr O'Neill into the property, 
    however, he would continue to visit the property sitting in the back garden 
    shouting and throwing stones at the windows. Miss Bond subsequently viewed 
    the situation as intolerable and fled to London . . . '
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>She stayed at a refuge in Chiswick, then returned to Leicester and 
  alternated between her mother's address and a friend's address. </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>On 11 February 2000 she approached the council and 
  applied for assistance. At that stage the accommodation at Appleby Close was 
  still available to her. The Council's decision letter dated 17 April 2000 
  refused her application on the ground that it was reasonable for her to return 
  there. The reasons given were: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'Whilst I recognise that you have a long history of fleeing 
    harassment from Mr O'Neill, you have never taken any preventative measures 
    to address this matter. I am satisfied that you have left 18 Appleby Close, 
    Leicester, without taking any reasonable steps to inform either De Montfort 
    Housing Society, the Police or any other representative body in relation to 
    the alleged harassment.' </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>The letter recommended that she 'take actions to address the alleged 
  harassment'. </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>The appellant instructed SHARP to represent her 
  and they applied for a review under section 202 of the 1996 Act. An exchange 
  of letters followed. While this was happening, 18 Appleby Close was 
  repossessed. Hence it was no longer available to her. The review decision 
  letter, which is the subject of this appeal, is dated 9 August 2000. The 
  reviewing officer found Miss Bond homeless and that she had a priority need 
  because of the children, but that she was homeless intentionally as she had 
  deliberately ceased to occupy accommodation which was available for her 
  occupation and he found it to be reasonable for her to continue to occupy that 
  accommodation. The reasons given were as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'Miss Bond has been the subject of domestic violence from Mr 
    O'Neill for some considerable time having had to flee two previous 
    properties before arriving at Appleby Close, Leicester. In my view Miss Bond 
    should have taken action under the criminal/civil law to prevent Mr O'Neill 
    from coming near her or indeed Appleby Close. The nature of the problems at 
    Appleby Close were that once Mr O'Neill had been excluded from 18 Appleby 
    Close he did not seek to re-enter the property by force. In these 
    circumstances Miss Bond should have, at the very least, sort [sic] legal 
    advice and indeed at the very least, should have approached both the Police 
    and the landlord. Miss Bond would not be on her own as the landlord in this 
    case, being a social landlord, had its own remedies to keep Mr O'Neill away 
    from the property and the area. Miss Bond herself would have been offered 
    protection in the way of alarms at her property, which if used would 
    guarantee a grade 1 response from the Police. Both the Police and social 
    landlord have domestic violence policies which would mean that additional 
    security in the way of toughened doors, toughened glass, and indeed in some 
    cases, cameras can be fitted at the victim's property. I do not accept your 
    client's position that Mr O'Neill is above the law and have decided that to 
    consider the legal remedies is not sufficient but that she should have 
    obtained both advice and assistance from all the agencies and consequently, 
    I consider that she became homeless intentionally as she failed to take 
    these measures and as a consequence of her failure, she ceased to occupy 
    accommodation which was available for her occupation and would have been 
    reasonable for her to continue to occupy.'</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The judgment below</B></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>The appellant exercised her right to appeal to the 
  county court. This is an appeal on a point of law only. The proper approach to 
  such appeals was set out in <I>Crawley Borough Council v B</I> (2000) 32 HLR 
  636. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>The judge had to construe section 177(1): 'It is 
  not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is 
  probable that this will lead to domestic violence against him…' He rightly 
  held that 'this' refers to continued occupation of the property in question. 
  But he also held that 'it cannot be said simply that it is a [? the] fact of 
  occupation of those particular premises which itself gives rise to a risk of 
  domestic violence.' He held that the Council were entitled to take two 
  considerations into account. The first was that the risk of domestic violence 
  appeared to stem substantially from Miss Bond's own conduct in continuing 
  contact or possibly a relationship with the perpetrator. The probability of 
  domestic violence stemmed more from her continued relationship with him than 
  from her occupation of the premises. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>Both parties object to this finding by the judge 
  as there was nothing in the material before the court to suggest that the 
  authority did take into account the risk of violence stemming from her 
  continued contact or relationship with Mr O'Neill. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>Secondly, however, he held that it seemed that 
  once Miss Bond had succeeded in excluding Mr O'Neill he did not force his way 
  in and there was no allegation of further violence or threat of violence. In 
  those circumstances, the authority were entitled to take into account the 
  steps it was reasonable for her to have taken to protect herself from any risk 
  of further violence. There was no evidence here that such action would have 
  been ineffective or even that she genuinely feared that it would be 
  ineffective. She had succeeded in excluding him from the premises and he did 
  not then seek to gain re-entry. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The arguments in this appeal</B></P>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>The main issue in this case is whether this 
  particular local authority asked themselves the right question when making 
  their decisions. Did they simply apply their minds to the question in section 
  177(1): is (or was) it probable that Miss Bond's continued occupation of 18 
  Appleby Close would lead to actual domestic violence against her or to a 
  threat of domestic violence which is (or was) likely to be carried out? Or did 
  they treat the matter as one at large, allowing them to take into account 
  wider considerations of reasonableness, and in particular what the applicant 
  could be expected to do (or have done) to protect herself? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>In addressing this issue, Mr Luba has the easier 
  task. Although both letters refer to section 177(1), neither of them makes any 
  finding that it was <U>not</U> probable that Miss Bond would suffer domestic 
  violence if she returned to or had stayed in 18 Appleby Close. Both letters 
  concentrate principally on the steps she might have taken instead of moving 
  out. Both conclude that it was reasonable for her to return. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>Mr Arden correctly points out that decision 
  letters such as these are not to be construed like statutes. Courts must start 
  from the proposition that authorities know what they are doing and construe 
  their words in that light. More importantly, he argues that the various steps 
  which might have been taken to protect Miss Bond had she remained in the 
  property were relevant to the question of whether (putting it loosely) she 
  would have been at risk in remaining. Given that they were relevant, the 
  authority should not be faulted for failing expressly to reach the statutory 
  conclusion. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Both parties place some reliance on the 
  legislative history and on the Secretary of State's Code of Guidance. Part VII 
  of the Housing Act 1996 is the successor to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 
  1977 (later consolidated in the Housing Act 1985). Section 1(2)(b) of the 1977 
  Act provided that a person was homeless even if he had accommodation if it was 
  probable that occupation of it would lead to violence (or threats of violence) 
  from some other person living there. There was no statutory reasonableness 
  test in the definition of homelessness and judicial attempts to introduce one 
  were decisively rejected by the House of Lords in <I>Puhlhofer v Hillingdon 
  London Borough Council</I> [1986] 1 AC 484. However, Parliament then acted to 
  restore it. Section 14(2) of the Housing and Planning Act 1986 added section 
  58(2A) to the Housing Act 1985 in which the homelessness provisions had been 
  consolidated. Thus, under the old law, there was already a distinction in the 
  definition of homelessness between those who were at risk of domestic violence 
  in the home and those who for other reasons could not reasonably be expected 
  to continue to live there. Section 177(1) merely widened the scope of the 
  domestic violence rule, incorporating risks <U>from</U> associated people not 
  living in the same household and <U>to</U> other members of the applicant's 
  household as well as the applicant herself. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>However, the difference between the old law and 
  the new lies in the way in which the risk of domestic violence is related to 
  the reasonableness test, and the effect this has upon the definition of 
  intentional homelessness. Section 17(1) of the 1977 Act was for practical 
  purposes identical to section 191(1) of the 1996 Act (see paragraph 7 above). 
  In <I>R v London Borough of Wandsworth, ex parte Nimako-Boateng</I> (1983) 11 
  HLR 98, Woolf J (as he then was) said this: </A>

  <P>That was not, however, a case of domestic violence. It was not argued that 
  the lady was already homeless within the meaning of section 1(2)(b) of the 
  1977 Act. That argument was raised in <I>R v Purbeck District Council, ex 
  parte Cadney</I> (1985) 17 HLR 534, but the authority found as a fact that the 
  applicant was not at risk and Nolan J (as he then was) did not feel able to 
  interfere with that finding on judicial review.</P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>These cases are of no help to us now in applying 
  section 177(1). <I>Nimako-Boateng</I> was concerned with the test of 
  reasonableness at large. Had that been applicable here, this court might well 
  have agreed with the observations of Woolf J quoted above. But neither in 
  deciding upon homelessness or upon intentionality is the test of 
  reasonableness at large in domestic violence cases. The only test is what is 
  probable. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>This in my view is a pure question of fact, devoid 
  of value judgments about what an applicant should or should not do. If there 
  are measures which have been taken or probably will be taken which will 
  probably prove effective in preventing actual or threatened violence, then 
  that may reduce the level of risk below one of probability. But those are the 
  questions which the authority must ask themselves, rather than assume that 
  such measures will be taken or will be effective if taken. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>For what it is worth, it appears that the 
  Secretary of State shares this view of the law. A new Code of Guidance 
  accompanied the 1996 Act. Chapter 13 of that guidance is headed 'HOMELESS OR 
  THREATENED WITH HOMELESSNESS'. A subheading above para 13.7 deals with 'Is it 
  reasonable for the applicant to continue to occupy the accommodation?'. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>This covers matters which may be taken into 
  account when considering reasonableness at large, including at para 13.8(e), 
  'violence or threats of violence from persons <U>not</U> associated with the 
  applicant.' This advises that </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'In some instances, the authority may advise an applicant to 
    pursue any available legal remedies. This should not be done as a matter of 
    policy but on the merits of an individual case and will need to take account 
    of the need to ensure the proper safety of the applicant'. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Another subheading above para 13.9 deals with 'Domestic Violence'. Para 
  13.10 includes the following:</P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'The fact that violence has not yet occurred does not, on its 
    own, suggest that it is not likely to occur. Authorities should not base 
    their assessment of a likely threat of violence solely on whether there has 
    been actual violence in the past. Injunctions ordering persons not to 
    molest, or enter the home of, the applicant will not necessarily deter 
    people and the applicant should not necessarily be asked to return to 
    his/her home in this instance. Authorities may inform applicants of the 
    option to take out an injunction, but should make it clear that there is no 
    obligation to do so if s/he feels it would be ineffective.' 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Clearly, therefore, the Secretary of State considers that there should be 
  no pressure to explore alternative remedies and the matter should be left to 
  the applicant. A later consultation draft of the code went further and omitted 
  the words 'if s/he feels it would be ineffective' altogether, thus reinforcing 
  the view that the mere availability of such remedies does not answer the 
  probability question. </P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>I do not find this conclusion at all surprising. 
  Taken to the extreme, it could mean that a probable victim of domestic 
  violence, who had been offered every assistance available for her protection, 
  could reject it and seek rehousing even if there was good reason to think that 
  it would be effective. But Mr Arden acknowledges that even cases like the 
  present one, in which the applicant had twice before fled from domestic 
  violence, are rare. It will be rare indeed for a parent of children (for this 
  is what gives her the priority need) to uproot herself from a situation in 
  which legal or practical measures are not only on offer but likely to be 
  effective. But the issues are issues of fact in the particular case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>To hold otherwise would leave it open to local 
  authorities to put pressures upon the victims of domestic violence which fail 
  to take account of some of its well known features. Once begun it is likely to 
  be repeated, often with escalating severity. It induces a sense of shame and 
  of powerlessness in the victims, who often blame themselves and find it 
  impossible to escape. There are various legal and practical remedies 
  available, but it is by no means easy for many victims to invoke these. 
  However hard the family courts try, they are often ineffective. Escape may 
  well be the only practicable answer. The victim is the one who knows the 
  perpetrator best and is likely to be best able to judge this. It is not, after 
  all, a decision to be lightly taken by a young mother of two young children. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>The family courts also do their utmost to require 
  parents with whom the children are living to arrange and encourage contact 
  with the other parent. Only comparatively recently have we recognised that 
  violence and threats towards the parent can have a damaging effect upon the 
  children, such that it may constitute a good reason for refusing all contact. 
  Even now, there is certainly no presumption to that effect. In those 
  circumstances, it would be most unfair if one part of the system were to blame 
  or penalise a mother for resuming contact with the father of her children, 
  unless another part of the system has found that there should be no contact 
  because it is harmful to them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>Whatever the facts of this particular case, 
  therefore, I do not find it surprising that Parliament should have recognised 
  a tendency in parts of the system to consider it reasonable to expect victims 
  of domestic violence to do, or not to do, things which in reality place them 
  in an almost impossible position; and that Parliament should therefore have 
  enacted the clear rule in section 177(1). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>Mr Arden raised another argument which depends 
  upon the construction of the definition of intentional homelessness in section 
  191(1) (see paragraph 7 above). He accepts that the probability of domestic 
  violence test in section 177(1) applies to the question of reasonableness in 
  section 191(1) just as it does to the same question in section 175(3); but he 
  argues that one can become homeless intentionally if one deliberately does or 
  fails to do anything in consequence of which it becomes unreasonable to 
  continue to occupy the property. Thus, he argues, a woman who knows what can 
  be done and deliberately fails to do it may have caused the probability of 
  domestic violence which makes her continued occupation unreasonable. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>One answer to this is that it will be a rare case 
  in which it can properly be said that the probability of domestic violence was 
  the consequence of her failure to take action. More importantly, however, the 
  words 'deliberately does or fails to do anything' clearly relate to the 
  'consequence' of ceasing to occupy the accommodation. The words 'which is 
  available for his occupation and which it is reasonable for him to continue to 
  occupy' simply describe the necessary characteristics of that accommodation. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The outcome</B></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>Despite Mr Arden's valiant attempts to attach a 
  different meaning to the authority's decision letters, and in particular the 
  review letter of 9 August 2000, they did not clearly ask, let alone clearly 
  answer, the right question. The authority therefore erred in law. On appeal, 
  section 204(3) of the 1996 Act permits the county court and hence this court 
  either to confirm, quash or vary the decision as it thinks fit. Mr Luba 
  invites us to vary the decision by the insertion of the word 'not': had the 
  authority asked the right question, the only possible conclusion would have 
  been that it was probable that continued occupation of 18 Appleby Close would 
  lead to domestic violence against Miss Bond, so that she was <U>not</U> 
  intentionally homeless in leaving that address. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>One certainly cannot reach the conclusion that, if 
  the authority had addressed the right question they would have arrived at the 
  same result. There was abundant material upon which they could have reached 
  the conclusion that further domestic violence was probable if she stayed. 
  There had been domestic violence in the past, such that she had twice before 
  left her accommodation with two young children to escape it. There had been 
  domestic violence in these very premises, it appears when he was reluctant to 
  leave after visiting the family. Thereafter, although he had not forced his 
  way into the premises, he had taken to sitting in the back garden, shouting 
  and throwing stones at the windows. This pattern of behaviour is all too 
  familiar to family judges. Many victims find it a great deal more frightening 
  than the violence itself. The definition of domestic violence in section 
  177(1) includes 'threats of violence which are likely to be carried out'. 
  'Likely' is different from 'probable'. 'Probable' means 'more likely than 
  not'. 'Likely' includes a real or serious possibility. Such behaviour may 
  readily be held to constitute a threat of further violence which is likely to 
  be carried out by a person who has not only done it before but shown a 
  readiness to use it as a response to exclusion from the home. There was 
  nothing to suggest that the applicant had a full understanding of what might 
  be done to help her or that she would feel that it would be so effective that 
  she would probably have sought such help if she had returned. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>Hence it seems to me more likely than not that if 
  the authority had asked themselves the right questions they would have reached 
  the conclusion on the material before them for which Mr Luba contends. There 
  would be little point in quashing the decision and sending it back for them to 
  make it once more. If the order is instead varied, as sought, they will then 
  be in a position to arrange accommodation which takes account of the problems 
  in this case and thus reduces the probability of domestic violence in future. 
  I would therefore allow the appeal and vary the decision to one that the 
  applicant had not become homeless intentionally. </A>
