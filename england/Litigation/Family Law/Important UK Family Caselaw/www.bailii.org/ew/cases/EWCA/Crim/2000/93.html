  <LI value=1><A name=para1>LORD JUSTICE OTTON: In the Crown Court at Lewes 
  before His Honour Judge Hayward, GSH, the appellant, was convicted of an 
  offence of harassment contrary to section 4(1) and (4) of the Protection from 
  Harassment Act 1997. He was subsequently sentenced to six months' 
  imprisonment. He appeals against conviction and sentence by leave of the 
  single judge. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>The appellant and the complainant were partners of 
  some standing. They lived together from March 1998 until 27th October 1999, 
  when she left the appellant. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>On 1st November 1999 the appellant was arrested. He 
  was interviewed in respect of three matters, namely an alleged rape and two 
  offences of causing actual bodily harm, which were said to have occurred on 
  30th April and 26th or 27th October 1999 respectively. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>The appellant was subsequently charged with 
  harassment only. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>There then followed a rather unusual train of 
  events, centring on a number of indictments, the history of which it is 
  necessary to set out in some detail. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>The first indictment contained one count of 
  harassment. The count alleged a course of conduct between 11th April and 30th 
  October 1999 and included an allegation that on 12th April the appellant had 
  indecently assaulted the complainant. No plea was taken at the first plea and 
  directions hearing on 21st January 2000 because the Crown indicated that it 
  wished to review the indictment and consider whether to add a count of rape. 
  The Crown later informed the defence that it intended to apply to add a count 
  of rape to that indictment and that the harassment particulars would not 
  include the allegation of indecent assault. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>The matter came before the judge on 22nd March. On 
  that occasion the Crown applied to amend the indictment to include a count of 
  rape. This was objected to on the ground that the rape count should not be 
  added to the indictment since it was not founded on the same facts as the 
  harassment count, nor was it part of a series of offences of the same 
  character. The learned judge indicated that there was a gap in the particulars 
  in the harassment count between April and October, although it was clear from 
  the complainant's statement that the abusive, violent and threatening 
  behaviour continued during that period. If the count were amended to include 
  particulars of incidents between those months then the count on the present 
  indictment would be sound. Thus, the alarm bells started to ring for the 
  Crown. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>The learned judge also held that the allegation of 
  rape was not founded on the same facts but it did arise from an incident on 
  12th April. The allegation was that the appellant was guilty of a course of 
  violent and abusive behaviour towards the complainant and that allegations 
  included rape on one occasion and violence and threats of violence on the 
  other occasions. The proper way to proceed was to add the rape count. However, 
  in respect of the rape allegation, the counts would be heard separately 
  because the evidence of the appellant's alleged behaviour after 12th April 
  would be highly prejudicial to a fair trial on the rape count. That was the 
  way the matter rested on 22nd March. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>On 10th April the indictment was amended. In respect 
  of the harassment count, particulars were set out in numbered paragraphs 
  identifying the incidents relied upon to show harassment. The count alleged a 
  course of conduct between 28th April and 30th October. Paragraph 2 alleged 
  that between 30th April and 30th October the appellant assaulted the 
  complainant on a number of occasions by throwing a stool at her, hitting her, 
  restricting her breathing by putting her hands over her mouth or around her 
  throat and attempting to smother her with a pillow. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>The case eventually came into court on 10th April, 
  when the appellant was arraigned. On that occasion it was contended on his 
  behalf that, since none of the complainant's witness statements referred to 
  the dates of the allegations outlined in paragraph 2, they could all easily 
  have occurred in October, in which case the original complaint about the 
  indictment had not been cured. The learned judge ruled that the complainant 
  had said that, over a period of time and on a fairly regular basis, she had 
  been ill-treated by the appellant. Consequently, the indictment was valid. If 
  the evidence did not support a course of conduct then the remedy was to make a 
  submission at the end of the Crown's case. That, so far as this Court is 
  concerned, was an indication to the prosecution that if their case did not 
  stand up and there was no interlink between the April and October incidents 
  they were in trouble on the indictment as it was then hooked to a general 
  count of harassment. The Crown indicated that it proposed to take a further 
  statement from the complainant, which would deal with her ability to recall 
  the dates upon which the incidents occurred. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>On 3rd August the trial commenced. At the outset, 
  the Crown successfully applied to delete paragraph 3 of the particulars of the 
  harassment count. The remaining paragraphs were renumbered, thus making 
  version four of the indictment. The counts still alleged a course of conduct 
  between 28th April and 30th October, the particulars of which alleged as 
  follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(i) On 30th April the appellant assaulted the complainant by 
    throwing a coffee table at her which struck her leg and pushing her 
  over;</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(ii) Between 30th April and 30th October the appellant assaulted 
    the complainant on a number of occasions by throwing a stool at her, hitting 
    her, restrict her breathing by putting his hands over her mouth or around 
    her throat and attempting to smother her with a pillow;</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(iii) on a date Between 25th and 28th October the appellant 
    threatened the complainant with a kitchen knife, caused damage to her 
    property and assaulted her by forcibly bending her backwards and 
    subsequently putting her against a wall and on 29th October he attended 32 
    Parker Court [where the complainant lived] and kicked the door several 
    times."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>Confronted with this indictment, defence counsel 
  submitted that the complainant's most recent witness statement disclosed no 
  evidence that the April incident was linked to the October incidents. 
  Harassment was a continuing offence. There was nothing to show that the April 
  matter was more than an unconnected incident. This was particularly so since 
  the parties continued to live with each other through the relevant period, 
  during which time as it had emerged in the earlier rape trial the complainant 
  had made a video of the parties having sexual intercourse together. The judge 
  was referred to the case of Lau, to which reference will be made hereafter. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>On that occasion the learned judge held that the 
  present state of the evidence was that the complainant could not recall 
  specific dates when she had been assaulted. The gap had been narrowed from the 
  end of April to early October. It was not clear from the statement how often 
  she had been assaulted. Counsel suggested that the phrase "a number of 
  occasions" in paragraph 2 of the particulars suggested a number of single, 
  separate incidents of violence. Her statements did not suggest that each type 
  of incident had occurred more than once. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>It was agreed that the incident involving the 
  kitchen knife, the damage to the complainant's property and bending her 
  backwards, as alleged in paragraph 3, all occurred on the same occasion. 
  Counsel had contended that, if the incident on 29th October, the kicking of 
  the door at 32 Parker Court, was a separate incident then it was not something 
  which could come within the course of conduct. The learned judge disagreed. It 
  was a matter for the jury to decide. If true, the incident would be the 
  clearest possible evidence of an aggressive attitude on the part of the 
  appellant towards his by then former partner. At the stage at which the 
  proceedings had reached there was evidence to support the allegation of 
  harassment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>Pausing there, we would not criticise the learned 
  judge for taking that line. On the papers there was at least a tenuous link 
  between the substantive incident in April and the incident at the end of 
  October, which suggested that there was some linkage between the two incidents 
  and they were not merely separate and isolated incidents but part of a course 
  of conduct. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>However, when the complainant came to give 
  evidence she made it plain that she was able to pinpoint the incidents which 
  occurred on 30th April since her aunt had held a barbecue on that day. The 
  appellant had lost his temper and had thrown a small table, which hit her on 
  the leg. The appellant then grabbed her hair, pulled her to the ground and 
  caused her to hit her head on the daughter's doll's buggy. That clearly 
  indicated an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>She went on to say that, on a day in October, the 
  appellant came home after he had been drinking. The appellant fell on the 
  stairs. An argument ensued, during which she was threatened and subsequently 
  pushed against a door, at which point the appellant punched a knife into the 
  doorframe. The complainant said that she believed that the appellant was going 
  to kill her. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>She then gave evidence which tended to show a 
  linkage. She said that, although vague as to dates of the other incidents, 
  between April and October the appellant frequently pulled her hair and 
  sometimes placed his hand over her mouth from behind in order to stop her 
  screaming. This had taken place two or three times a week from April onwards. 
  She would be pulled back towards the floor. The applicant also began to push 
  her, putting his weight on her, sometimes holding her down by his knee when 
  she was in bed. She said that there had only been one occasion when the 
  appellant had smothered her with a pillow, which had occurred on the same 
  occasion that he tried to restrict her breathing. She also said that, on 
  occasions, things did improve between them, but in October they deteriorated 
  again. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>She was then cross-examined by counsel, Miss 
  Frost, to some effect. This revealed that there were inconsistencies between 
  her evidence and what she had said in her affidavits sworn on 1st November 
  1999 and prepared in respect of injunction proceedings in a civil domestic 
  dispute. The complainant agreed that in her affidavit she had said that the 
  incident of hair pulling had occurred only in April 1999 and that there had 
  been no physical incidents at all between April and October. She did not 
  regard the incidents of hair pulling as physical incidents at all or but as a 
  wholly different form of violence. When describing the April incident in her 
  witness statement, the complainant had not mentioned that her hair had been 
  pulled. When describing the October incident, she had said in evidence that 
  she did not see the knife until it was stuck into the doorframe near her head. 
  In her statement she said that she had seen that the appellant had a knife 
  when she had first walked into the kitchen before the assault. The accounts 
  were utterly irreconcilable. She must have been wrong about one version or the 
  other, if not both. She accepted that when she had spoken to the detective 
  constable in May 1999 she had not mentioned being pushed or pulled over. Nor 
  had she mentioned cutting her head on the doll's buggy. In respect of the 
  occasion when the appellant had placed a pillow over her face, she had said in 
  her statement that that incident had occurred in October. She accepted that it 
  might have been earlier. When pressed by reference to her affidavit, she said 
  that it had probably taken place in April. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>At the end of the prosecution's evidence, not 
  surprisingly, counsel submitted that there was no case to answer. It was 
  conceded that there was evidence on an assault on 30th April and 27th October, 
  but counsel submitted the evidence did not establish a course of conduct. The 
  only evidence of any conduct between those dates was of regular hair pulling, 
  an allegation which had not been particularised in the indictment. In any 
  event, the complainant seemed not to put these in the same category as the 
  other two incidents she had mentioned. Her evidence of hair pulling was 
  unreliable and did not in any event amount to an incident of the type required 
  to establish it as being part of a course of conduct. The learned judge held 
  that the particulars which had been given were intended to summarise: they 
  were not a pleading. He did not agree that the Crown could not rely upon the 
  allegation of hair pulling which the complainant said had taken place between 
  April and October. There was ample prima facie evidence to go before the jury. 
  It was not so tenuous or contradictory that it could be ruled out. He went on 
  to say that if the jury were satisfied so that it was sure about those 
  allegations it could convict. If they were not satisfied about the hair 
  pulling incidents, then there were just two separate incidents and the jury 
  would be told that they might feel that they did not amount to harassment as 
  defined by the Act. The appellant did not give evidence, nor was any evidence 
  called on his behalf. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>Given that unusual background and the conduct of 
  the prosecution in particular in not being able to formulate their case until 
  after four attempts had been made to settle an indictment upon which they were 
  prepared to prosecute, it is not surprising that Miss Frost advances her 
  arguments with some force before this court. We are bound to say that this was 
  a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. It may have been wiser not to have 
  proceeded by way of a single count in the indictment alleging harassment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Section 1 of the Act provides: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(1) A person must not pursue a course of conduct---</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) which amounts to harassment of another, 
  and</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of 
      the other." </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>The commentary in Archbold is illuminating which 
  reads (at 19-277a): </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The Act describes itself as one 'to make provision for 
    protecting persons from harassment and similar conduct'. It was passed for 
    the purpose of dealing with the phenomenon of 'stalking'. There is, however, 
    no attempt at a definition of harassment, although section 7(2) provides 
    that references to harassing a person include alarming the person or causing 
    the person distress. It is obvious, therefore, that the Act may be used to 
    prosecute a range of persons apart from those commonly referred to as 
    'stalkers'." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>Section 4(1), with a shoulder heading "Putting 
  people in fear of violence", provides: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"A person whose course of conduct causes another to fear, on at 
    least two occasions, that violence will be used against him is guilty of an 
    offence if he knows or ought to have known that his course of conduct will 
    cause the other so to fear on each of those occasions." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>Thus, harassment is a particular and discrete 
  offence from the normal offences of specified violence. It is a basic 
  ingredient of the offence that there should be a course of conduct, and one 
  which the person knows or ought to know that his course of conduct will cause 
  the other to fear on each of those occasions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>The whole thrust of the prosecution case - and 
  indeed the evidence from the complainant herself - centred on two separate and 
  individual incidents, namely the assault in April and the assault in October. 
  They were a considerable distance apart. On their face and on the evidence 
  there was a clear prima facie case which would have justified counts in the 
  indictment alleging actual bodily harm on each occasion. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>The Court of Appeal in March 2000 considered the 
  case of Lau v DPP, which concerned two incidents between a girlfriend and a 
  boyfriend. It was held that although incidents to be proved in relation to 
  harassment need not exceed two incidents, the fewer the occasions and the 
  wider they were spread the less likely it would be that a finding of 
  harassment could reasonably be made. It was possible to conceive of 
  circumstances where incidents as far apart as a year could constitute a course 
  of conduct and harassment, namely racial harassment taking place outside a 
  synagogue on a religious holiday and repeated each year or a threat to do 
  something once a year on a person's birthday. Nevertheless the broad position 
  had to be that if one was left with only two incidents it was necessary to see 
  whether what happened on those two occasions could be described as a course of 
  conduct. It was not possible to answer that question, adopting an essentially 
  mathematical approach by saying that there were two incidents and that showed 
  that there was a course of conduct. The root question on which the magistrates 
  ought to have concentrated was whether or not, bearing in mind that they had 
  only found two of the incidents proved, separated as they were by some four 
  months, and in the absence of any other relevant finding, that could 
  reasonably be described as a course of conduct by the defendant. As the facts 
  did not reveal sufficient material to have enabled the magistrates to convict 
  the appellant of harassment the conviction would be quashed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>Miss Frost has brought that decision to our 
  attention and also the commentary, which is to be found in <A 
  title="Link to BAILII version" 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/182.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/182.html">[2000] Crim LR 580</a></A>, which emphasises that in order to constitute an offence under 
  the Act there must be conduct on at least two occasions and that it includes 
  verbal violence as well. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>With that analysis we return to the instant case. 
  At the close of the prosecution case it became abundantly clear that the 
  position which the learned judge had adopted at the outset was, to say the 
  least, severely undermined. In cross-examination it became apparent that the 
  complainant herself was concentrating and most affected by the two incidents, 
  which were some five or six months apart. When it came to the linking 
  evidence, she became vague and the contradictory statements placed her 
  credibility in a very serious position. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>He had already indicated that if the case on the 
  linking conduct did not come up to proof he would have been prepared to stop 
  the case at half-time. Here evidence had dramatically fallen apart. We have to 
  consider whether the evidence at that stage did constitute sufficient to make 
  the necessarily cogent linkage between the two offences. In our view it did 
  not. We are obliged to say that we feel that, given the particular nature of 
  the offence of harassment, the situation did not justify the case going 
  forward to the jury. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>It is to be borne in mind that the state of 
  affairs which was relied upon by the prosecution was miles away from the 
  'stalking' type of offence for which the Act was intended. That is not to say 
  that it is never appropriate so to charge a person who is making a nuisance of 
  himself to his partner or wife when they have become estranged. However, in a 
  situation such as this, when they were frequently coming back together and 
  intercourse was taking place (apparently a video was taken of them having 
  intercourse) it is unrealistic to think that this fell within the stalking 
  category which either postulates a stranger or an estranged spouse. That was 
  not the situation when the course of conduct relied upon was committed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>In those circumstances, we have come to the 
  conclusion that, when the evidence crossed over the threshold from a mere 
  putting in fear to a substantive count of actual bodily harm, the prosecution 
  might have been wiser to have abandoned the harassment count and to have 
  concentrated on the two substantive counts of violence, and with more 
  prospects of success. They insisted, for reasons which are not entirely clear, 
  on proceeding with harassment counts, where, in the events leading up to the 
  arraignment at least, they were put on notice and that the chances of securing 
  a conviction on the single count of harassment alone in the indictment were 
  fast receding. We have come to the conclusion, therefore, that the conviction 
  is not safe. We must allow the appeal and it must be quashed. </A>
