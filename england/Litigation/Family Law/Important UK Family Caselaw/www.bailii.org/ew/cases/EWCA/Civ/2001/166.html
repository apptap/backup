<OL>
  <P>LORD JUSTICE THORPE: </P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>This was an expedited appeal with the permission of 
  Ward LJ from an order of His Honour Judge Langan made on 20 October 2000 in 
  the Cambridge County Court. The order relates to a little girl, S, who 
  has just attained the age of four. The judge refused an application for a 
  residence order made by S's father, and acceded to an application by 
  S's mother to remove S permanently from the United Kingdom and take 
  her to live in New Zealand. The appeal raised questions of principle of some 
  general importance. At the conclusion of the argument the appeal was dismissed 
  for reasons to be subsequently given in the form of a handed down judgment. 
  The facts set out below reflect the position at the date of the hearing on 21 
  December 2000. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>The Facts</P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>The facts fall, as the judge said in his careful 
  reserved judgment, into three distinct periods, with the scene shifting from 
  England to New Zealand and then back again to England. The summary which 
  follows is closely based on the judge's judgment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>The father is British. He is 33 years of age. He 
  lives in Newmarket, as do other members of his family. He is a self-employed 
  controls engineer working in the construction industry, and earning between 
  £40,000 and £50,000 a year. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>The mother is a citizen of New Zealand. She is 28 
  years of age. She comes from North Shore, a suburb of Auckland, which is where 
  her mother, her stepfather, her brother and his partner all live. The mother 
  is at present living in a small flat in Plumstead in South London. She has 
  experience in the financial services industry and she is at present working in 
  the settlements department of an insurance company and earning about £21,000 a 
  year. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>The mother came to London when she was in her early 
  twenties. She obtained a job in a bank and intended to use London as a base 
  for travel in Europe. In March 1996 she met the father, who was then living in 
  a house which he had bought in Stamford Hill in north-east London. They fell 
  in love, the mother became pregnant, and they got married on 19 September 
  1996. S was born on 16 January 1997. The judge thought, after hearing the 
  evidence, that S's parents would probably have got married in any case, 
  but that the pregnancy accelerated their decision. The mother gave up work in 
  order to be at home with S. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>Unhappily problems arose soon after S's birth. 
  S's maternal grandmother, Mrs C, came over from New Zealand to 
  help, but she did not get on with the father and she moved out of the house at 
  Stamford Hill. In July the parties separated, but only for two weeks. The 
  mother complained that the father was domineering. It also appears (not so 
  much from the judgment of Judge Langan but from the judgment of Judge 
  O'Donovan in family proceedings in New Zealand in May 1999) that part of the 
  trouble was that the mother did not like living in Stamford Hill, in a house 
  without any garden, and in a part of London which she did not find congenial. 
  Even before S was born, her parents had been talking of selling the 
  house. It was put on the market but it was not sold until February 1998. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>By then S's parents had definitely decided to 
  go abroad, but there was a conflict of evidence at the first instance hearings 
  in New Zealand and England as to what their plans really were. The mother's 
  case was that they would all live in New Zealand, after the husband had first 
  carried out a contract in Kuala Lumpur. The father's case was that the stay in 
  New Zealand was to be exploratory, with no firm commitment, especially as his 
  work prospects were uncertain. That issue was of great importance to Judge 
  O'Donovan, sitting in New Zealand, since he had to deal with Hague Convention 
  issues, as reflected in sections 12 and 13 of the Guardianship Amendment Act 
  of New Zealand. Judge Langan took the view that those past controversies had 
  little if any relevance to decisions about S's future. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>So the family left England, the mother and S 
  for Auckland and the father for Kuala Lumpur. The mother and S were in 
  New Zealand for about fourteen months, from March 1998 until May 1999. For 
  three months they lived with Mrs C and her husband. Then they moved into 
  a two-bedroom flat. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>Until August 1998 the father was mostly working in 
  Kuala Lumpur, but with one short visit (of about a week) to New Zealand in 
  June. The father made enquiries about employment opportunities but was not 
  encouraged. He also observed a lack of warmth on the part of his wife. This 
  was more marked when he arrived in New Zealand for a second time on 27 August 
  1998, after the completion of the contract in Kuala Lumpur. Indeed, the couple 
  separated within a week. On 3 September 1998 the mother applied to the North 
  Shore Family Court for custody and an order preventing the father from 
  removing S from New Zealand. The father made a cross-application for 
  custody and permission to remove S from the country. There were fairly 
  lengthy proceedings in which both parents gave oral evidence. Judge O'Donovan 
  did not find the mother a convincing witness. He thought it likely that even 
  before they left England she had decided to separate from the husband once 
  they got to New Zealand. He thought that their problems on his arrival in 
  August 1999 were (in Judge O'Donovan's words): </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>" due to the attitude of the wife, which clearly was that she 
    did not want to remain in the marriage and had turned her back completely on 
    the possibility of living other than in New Zealand."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>On 4 May 1999 Judge O'Donovan ordered that S 
  should be returned to the United Kingdom and she travelled back on 16 May 1999 
  by a Malaysian Airlines flight, accompanied by both her parents. So began the 
  third and most recent chapter of her life. When they arrived at Heathrow the 
  father went to Newmarket and the mother took S, not to her uncle and aunt 
  in Finchley (whose address the mother had given to the father) but to another 
  address unknown to the father. The father traced them within a few days, with 
  the help of the police, but the incident caused him distress. Judge Langan 
  said of this episode: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>" ... the mother's conduct at this stage was, as I believe she 
    now recognises, of a most discreditable kind even if one makes every 
    allowance for the aftermath of the Hague Convention proceedings and the 
    stress of the flight from Auckland. What she did was bound to cause hurt and 
    genuine anxiety to S's other parent ..."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>Proceedings were then instituted in the Cambridge 
  County Court, and a consent order was made on 2 June 1999 which regulated 
  S's life from then until the recent applications. A residence order was 
  made in favour of the mother, but she was prohibited from removing S from 
  the jurisdiction. The father was to have contact with S under provision 
  which the judge described as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"S is to have contact with the father on alternate 
    weekends, from Thursday evening to Sunday afternoon, together with an 
    additional period of seven days in every eight weeks. In fact, by agreement 
    between the parties, the alternate weekend contact has been extended so that 
    it starts on Wednesday evening. If my calculations are correct, what all 
    this means is that, in every cycle of 56 days, S spends 23 nights with 
    the father."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>The judge then described S's life with her 
  mother: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The mother lives, as I have already stated, in a one-bedroom 
    flat in Plumstead. Most of the units in the development are occupied by 
    elderly people, so that the environment is not ideal for a mother who is 
    bringing up a young child. The mother's job is in Borough High Street, 
    London SE1. Apart from times when S is with the father, the mother and 
    S leave home at 0730 on working days. The mother drives to a nursery 
    some 10 to 15 minutes away, and leaves S there for the rest of the day. 
    She continues her journey to work by car, walking, train and walking again, 
    and is at work from 0900 to 1700. In the evening she makes the return 
    journey, collecting S on the way, and they get home at about 
  1815."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>The judge then summarised the mother's financial 
  position (earnings of £21,000 a year, maintenance for S paid by the 
  father of £75 a week, and no social security benefits; rent of £400 a month 
  and nursery fees of nearly £100 a week payable even if S attends for only 
  part of the week). The judge then described the mother's feelings about her 
  present way of life, and the position about contact during the preceding year: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The mother has an intense dislike of life in London. She feels 
    isolated and gets depressed. She does not like the area in which she lives. 
    Last year her car was stolen, and crimes (including a rape) have been 
    committed just outside her house. Such friends as she has live a 
    considerable distance from Plumstead, although she does have two 
    stepbrothers who live not too far away. Because of her working arrangements, 
    and social difficulties (she does not have much chance to meet other young 
    mothers), she is, in her own words, 'unable to facilitate S's need to 
    meet other children to play with or do outside activities much'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>... </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>I have already mentioned the schedule of contact, as ordered by 
    the court and extended by agreement of the parties. The point for pick-up 
    and return is outside Redbridge underground station. The father is usually 
    accompanied by the paternal grandmother. The mother unhappily feels unable 
    to communicate with the other adults, which must make these occasions at 
    best artificial, if not fraught. The mother did in evidence say that she 
    realises that her 'attitude is exceptionally unhelpful'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>This is a case in which, as everyone involved has acknowledged, 
    contact goes exceptionally well. S engages in a wide range of both 
    day-to-day and leisure activities with the father and, when he is at work, 
    with the paternal grandmother. It is clear that she is greatly loved by the 
    father and by the other members of his family in the Newmarket area. Going 
    home puts something of a blight on the last day of contact, and a good deal 
    of evidence was given about S's reluctance to leave the father's car at 
    the end of the journey back to London. I am sure that S finds the 
    parting painful, but the evidence falls a long way short of demonstrating 
    that she is in any way unhappy once she is securely back in the care of the 
    mother. I accept what the mother says about S's settling down in her 
    car within a couple of minutes after leaving the father and his 
  family."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>For about a year the mother has had a close 
  relationship with a boyfriend, Mr Holmes. He works in financial services and 
  has his own flat in Bromley. The mother sees him mainly at weekends when 
  S is with her father. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>The judge said of S herself: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Everyone describes S as a healthy, intelligent, lively and 
    happy little girl. She is devoted to both her parents and they love her. She 
    has a strong attachment to the paternal grandmother and, whilst she has seen 
    comparatively little of the maternal grandmother over the past months, I am 
    sure that she has been (and may again be) no less attached to that 
  lady."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Law</P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>The modern law regulating applications for the 
  emigration of children begins with the decision of this court in <I>Poel v 
  Poel </I>[1970] 1 WLR 1469. I doubt that the judges deciding the case 
  recognised how influential it would prove to be. Whilst emphasising that the 
  court should have regard primarily to the welfare of the child, both Sachs LJ 
  and Winn LJ emphasised the importance of recognising and supporting the 
  function of the primary carer. That consideration was most clearly expressed 
  by Sachs LJ when he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"When a marriage breaks up, a situation normally arises when the 
    child of that marriage, instead of being in the joint custody of both 
    parents, must of necessity become one who is in the custody of a single 
    parent. Once that position has arisen and the custody is working well, this 
    court should not lightly interfere with such reasonable way of life as is 
    selected by that parent to whom custody has been rightly given. Any such 
    interference may, as my lord has pointed out, produce considerable strains 
    which would not only be unfair to the parent whose way of life is interfered 
    with but also to any new marriage of that parent. In that way it might well 
    in due course reflect on the welfare of the child. The way in which the 
    parent who properly has custody of a child may choose in a reasonable manner 
    to order his or her way of life is one of those things which the parent who 
    has not been given custody may well have to bear, even though one has every 
    sympathy with the latter on some of the results."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>In the later case of <I>Nash v Nash </I>[1973] 2 
  All ER 704, Davies LJ said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But I emphasise once more that when one parent has been given 
    custody it is a very strong thing for this court to make an order which will 
    prevent the following of a chosen career by the parent who has 
  custody."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>The subsequent development of this approach was 
  achieved by Ormrod LJ. In <I>A v A</I> [1979] 1 FLR 380 it appears that the 
  decision in <I>Poel v Poel</I> was cited by counsel for the father appealing 
  the grant of leave to the mother by the Family Division judge. For at page 381 
  he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is always difficult in these cases when marriages break up 
    where a wife who, as this one is, is very isolated in this country feels the 
    need to return to her own family and her own country; and, although Mr Swift 
    has argued persuasively for the test which was suggested in the case of 
    <I>Poel v Poel</I> [1970] 1 WLR 1469, the test which is often put on the 
    basis of whether it is reasonable for the mother to return to her own 
    country with the child, I myself doubt whether it provides a satisfactory 
    answer to this question. The fundamental question is what is in the best 
    interest of the child; and once it has been decided with so young a child as 
    this that there really is no option so far as care and control are 
    concerned, then one has to look realistically at the mother's position and 
    ask oneself the question: where is she going to have the best chance of 
    bringing up this child reasonably well? To that question the only possible 
    answer in this case is Hong Kong. It is true that it means cutting the child 
    off to a large extent - almost wholly perhaps - from the father; but that is 
    one of the risks which have to be run in cases of this kind. If it is wholly 
    unreasonable, as I think it is in this case, to require the mother to remain 
    in England, assuming even the court ought to put her in the position of 
    choosing between staying very unhappily and uncomfortably in England and 
    going home to her own country, then I still think the answer is that where 
    she can best bring up this child is the proper solution to this 
  case."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>He adopted the same approach in the unreported 
  case of <I>Moodey v Field</I> in 1981 when he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The question therefore in each case is, is the proposed move a 
    reasonable one from the point of view of the adults involved? If the answer 
    is yes, then leave should only be refused if it is clearly shown beyond any 
    doubt that the interests of the children and the interests of the custodial 
    parent are incompatible."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>This approach was questioned in the Family 
  Division by Balcombe J in the case of <I>Chamberlain v de la Mare</I>. He 
  emphasised that his duty was to regard the welfare of the child as the first 
  and paramount consideration and that each factor should be weighed one against 
  another no factor taking priority against another. His decision was reversed 
  in the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Ormrod held that Balcombe J had 
  misdirected himself in questioning whether the decisions in <I>Poel </I>and<I> 
  Nash </I>were consistent with the statute. Ormrod LJ emphasised that the court 
  in <I>Poel </I>had not weighed the interests of the adults against the 
  interests of the children but rather had weighed the effect on the children of 
  imposing unreasonable restraints on the adults. Having cited his earlier 
  decision in <I>Moodey v Field</I> he said at 443: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The reason why the court should not interfere with the 
    reasonable decision of the custodial parent, assuming, as this case does, 
    that the custodial parent is still going to be responsible for the children, 
    is, as I have said, the almost inevitable bitterness which such an 
    interference by the court is likely to produce. Consequently, in ordinary 
    sensible human terms the court should not do something which is, prima 
    facie, unreasonable unless there is some compelling reason to the contrary. 
    That I believe to be the correct approach."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>In the case of <I>Lonslow v Hennig</I> [1986] 2 
  FLR 378, Dillon LJ reviewed and applied these authorities in allowing a 
  mother's appeal from the refusal of her application to emigrate with the 
  children to New Zealand. Having reminded himself that so far as the law was 
  concerned the first point was that the welfare of the children was the 
  paramount consideration and secondly that previous cases decided on other 
  facts could only provide guidelines, he noted that there was a consistent line 
  of guidance throughout the decisions of this court since 1970. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>In <I>Belton v Belton</I> [1987] 2 FLR 343 Purchas 
  LJ in allowing a mother's appeal against the refusal of her application to 
  emigrate to New Zealand said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I sympathise and understand, where a lay person such as a 
    father is concerned, the difficulty of reconciliation with the concept of 
    such a separation being in the paramount interests of the child in the long 
    term, but the long-term interests of the child revolve around establishing, 
    as Griffiths LJ (as he then was) said in <I>Chamberlain</I>, a sound, secure 
    family unit in which the child should go forward and develop. If that can be 
    supported by contact with the father, that is an immense advantage, but, if 
    it cannot, then that is no reason for diverting one's concentration from the 
    central and paramount issue in the case."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>He summarised the authorities by saying: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>".... the authorities and the law dictate the hard and difficult 
    decision which must be made once it is established that the custodial parent 
    genuinely desires to emigrate and, in circumstances in which there is 
    nothing adverse to be found in the conditions to be expected, those 
    authorities are quite clear in the course that the court must take, whatever 
    the hardship and distress that may result."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>In <I>Tyler v Tyler</I> [1989] 2 FLR 158 Kerr LJ, 
  having been referred to virtually all the reported cases in which an issue of 
  this kind had arisen, offered this summary: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I also accept that this line of authority shows that where the 
    custodial parent herself, it was the mother in all those cases, has a 
    genuine and reasonable desire to emigrate then the court should hesitate 
    long before refusing permission to take the children."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>In more recent times both at first instance and in 
  this court I have sought to apply this line of authority to a series of cases 
  giving rise to differing facts and circumstances. We have been referred to 
  <I>MH v GP</I> [1995] 2 FLR 106, <I>Re H</I> [1998] 1 FLR 848 and <I>Re C</I> 
  [2000] 2 FLR 457. However in the first case I referred to the ratio in 
  <I>Chamberlain v de la Mare</I> as creating 'a presumption in favour of the 
  reasonable application of the custodial parent'. Equally in the last case I 
  said at 459 that 'a balance then had to be struck to determine whether or not 
  the resulting risk of harm to S was such as to outweigh the presumption 
  that reasonable proposals from the custodial parent should receive the 
  endorsement of the court'. In both passages I was using the word presumption 
  in the non-legal sense. But with the advantage of hindsight I regret the use 
  of that word. Generally in the language of litigation a presumption either 
  casts a burden of proof upon the party challenging it or can be said to be 
  decisive of outcome unless displaced. I do not think that such concepts of 
  presumption and burden of proof have any place in Children Act litigation 
  where the judge exercises a function that is partly inquisitorial. In the 
  context of applications for contact orders I expressed my misgivings in the 
  use of the language of presumptions: see in <I>Re L: Re V: Re M: Re H, 
  (Contact: Domestic Violence)</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/194.html">[2000] 2 FLR 334</a>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>In summary a review of the decisions of this court 
  over the course of the last thirty years demonstrates that relocation cases 
  have been consistently decided upon the application of the following two 
  propositions: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration; 
  and</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) refusing the primary carer's reasonable proposals for the 
    relocation of her family life is likely to impact detrimentally on the 
    welfare of her dependent children. Therefore her application to relocate 
    will be granted unless the court concludes that it is incompatible with the 
    welfare of the children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Value of the Guidance</P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>Few guidelines for the determination of individual 
  cases, the facts of which are never replicated, have stood so long in our 
  family law. Where guidelines can be formulated there are obvious benefits. The 
  opportunity for practitioners to give clear and confident advice as to outcome 
  helps to limit the volume of contested litigation. Of the cases that do 
  proceed to a hearing clear guidance from this court simplifies the task of the 
  trial judge and helps to limit the volume of appeals. The opportunity for this 
  court to give guidance capable of general application is plainly circumscribed 
  by the obvious consideration that any exercise of discretion is fact dependent 
  and no two cases are identical. But in relocation cases there are a number of 
  factors that are sufficiently commonplace to enhance the utility of 
  guidelines. I instance: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the applicant is invariably the mother and the primary 
  carer;</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) generally the motivation for the move arises out of her 
    remarriage or her urge to return home; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the father's opposition is commonly founded on a resultant 
    reduction in contact and influence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>Furthermore guidance of this sort is significant 
  in the wider field of international family law. There is a clear interaction 
  between the approach of courts in abduction cases and in relocation cases. If 
  individual jurisdictions adopt a chauvinistic approach to applications to 
  relocate then there is a risk that the parent affected will resort to flight. 
  Conversely recognition of the respect due to the primary carer's reasonable 
  proposals for relocation encourages applications in place of unilateral 
  removal. Equally as this case demonstrates, a return following a wrongful 
  retention allows a careful appraisal of welfare considerations on a subsequent 
  application to relocate. Accordingly it is very desirable that there should be 
  conformity within the international community. At the international common law 
  judicial conference arranged in Washington in September 2000 by the United 
  States an additional session was allocated to the discussion of the approach 
  adopted by the seven delegate jurisdictions to relocation cases. That 
  discussion demonstrated that for all jurisdictions the welfare of the child is 
  the paramount consideration. However some jurisdictions afford greater weight 
  than others to the harm that the refusal of the primary carer's reasonable 
  proposal is likely to cause to the children. In my judgment there is some 
  prospect that standardisation at a point close to the approach adopted in this 
  jurisdiction is achievable. There may an opportunity for evaluation across a 
  much wider range at the Fourth Special Commission to review the operation of 
  the 1980 Convention at the Hague in March 2001. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>The Foundation of the Guidance</P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>A review of the Court of Appeal authorities over 
  the last thirty years demonstrates that although not the originator of the 
  guidance, Ormrod LJ was its principal exponent. He rationalises it and its 
  strongest statement comes in his judgment in <I>Moodey v Field</I> as well 
  perhaps in the judgment of Purchas LJ in <I>Belton v Belton</I>. Since the 
  direction has stood for thirty years and since its amplification by Ormrod LJ, 
  first in <I>A v A</I> over twenty years ago, it is perhaps necessary to 
  question whether changing perceptions of child development and welfare in the 
  interim undermine or erode his exposition. That exposition, as he himself 
  said, was very much based on common sense. But even generally accepted 
  perceptions can shift within a generation. The shift upon which Mr Cayford 
  relies is in the sphere of contact. He asserts that over the last thirty years 
  the comparative importance of contact between the child and the absent parent 
  has greatly increased. No authority for the proposition is demonstrated. 
  Without some proof of the proposition I would be doubtful of accepting it. 
  Throughout my professional life in this specialist field contact between child 
  and absent parent has always been seen as an important ingredient in any 
  welfare appraisal. The language may have shifted but the proposition seems to 
  have remained constant. I believe that conviction is demonstrated by the 
  review of the contact cases over much the same period to be found in my 
  judgment in <I>Re L</I>, cited above, at 29. Furthermore practicalities are 
  all against this submission. International travel is comparatively cheaper and 
  more competitive than ever before. Equally communication is cheaper and the 
  options more varied. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>Quite apart from Mr Cayford's submission, I do not 
  believe that the evaluation of welfare within the mental health professions 
  over this period calls into any question the rationalisation advanced by 
  Ormrod LJ in his judgments. In a broad sense the health and well-being of a 
  child depends upon emotional and psychological stability and security. Both 
  security and stability come from the child's emotional and psychological 
  dependency upon the primary carer. The extent of that dependency will depend 
  upon many factors including its duration and the extent to which it is 
  tempered by or shared with other dependencies. For instance is the absent 
  parent an important figure in the child's life? What is the child's 
  relationship with siblings and/or grandparents and/or a step-parent? In most 
  relocation cases the judge will need to make some evaluation of these factors. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>Logically and as a matter of experience the child 
  cannot draw emotional and psychological security and stability from the 
  dependency unless the primary carer herself is emotionally and psychologically 
  stable and secure. The parent cannot give what she herself lacks. Although 
  fathers as well as mothers provide primary care I have never myself 
  encountered a relocation application brought by a father and for the purposes 
  of this judgment I assume that relocation applications are only brought by 
  maternal primary carers. The disintegration of a family unit is invariably 
  emotionally and psychologically turbulent. The mother who emerges with the 
  responsibility of making the home for the children may recover her sense of 
  well-being simply by coping over a passage of time. But often the mother may 
  be in need of external support, whether financial, emotional or social. Such 
  support may be provided by a new partner who becomes stepfather to the child. 
  The creation of a new family obviously draws the child into its quest for 
  material and other fulfilment. Such cases have given rise to the strongest 
  statements of the guidelines. Alternatively the disintegration of the family 
  unit may leave the mother in a society to which she was carried by the impetus 
  of family life before its failure. Commonly in that event she may feel 
  isolated and driven to seek the support she lacks by returning to her 
  homeland, her family and her friends. In the remarriage cases the motivation 
  for relocation may well be to meet the stepfather's career needs or 
  opportunities. In those cases refusal is likely to destabilise the new family 
  emotionally as well as to penalise it financially. In the case of the isolated 
  mother, to deny her the support of her family and a return to her roots may 
  have an even greater psychological detriment and she may have no one who might 
  share her distress or alleviate her depression. This factor is well 
  illustrated by the mother's evidence in this case. As recorded in Miss Hall's 
  note she said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Things happen and I think I can't stand it. I've got to go 
    home. But then I see S and I calm down and I think I can't leave her 
    .... I would give it a really good try to be a mother to S here but in 
    my heart of hearts I think I would not be able to do it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>Thus in most relocation cases the most crucial 
  assessment and finding for the judge is likely to be the effect of the refusal 
  of the application on the mother's future psychological and emotional 
  stability. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>The Impact of Statutory Reform</P>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>So if changing perceptions of child welfare do not 
  require a reformulation of the direction formulated by this court for the 
  guidance of trial judges have statutory reforms? Prior to the Children Act 
  1989 relocation applications were brought either within the divorce suit 
  alternatively in wardship. With the advent of the Children Act 1989 relocation 
  applications have been brought either under section 13, where there is a 
  residence order in force, or under section 8. They are therefore subject to 
  the welfare paramouncy principle in section 1(1) and, where the application is 
  under section 8, the welfare check-list in section 1(3). (Although technically 
  an application brought under section 13(1) is not subject to the welfare check 
  list it has been held that the trial judge should nevertheless take the 
  precaution of regarding the check list factors when carrying out his welfare 
  appraisal.) In my opinion these changes were of form and not of substance. A 
  jurisdiction which had been either inherent or under other statutory powers 
  received a new and comprehensive codification. These essentially procedural 
  reforms did not, in my opinion, require any reconsideration of this court's 
  consistent direction for the determination of relocation cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>However with the commencement of the Human Rights 
  Act 1998 on 2 October 2000 it was not hard to foresee that a father responding 
  to a relocation application would submit that the emigration of his child to a 
  distant land constituted a breach of his right to family life under Article 8. 
  This court indeed anticipated the development in its rejection of an 
  application for permission to appeal reported as <I>Re A</I> [2000] 2 FLR 225. 
  Although the Convention was not then of direct application and although the 
  court was not determining an appeal, the opinions expressed are obviously 
  persuasive. There has of course been some evolution in the application of the 
  Convention over the course of the last nine months and the view expressed by 
  Buxton LJ to the effect that the Convention has perhaps no place in this area 
  of litigation seems no longer sustainable, in the light of the decision of the 
  European Court in <I>Glaser v The United Kingdom</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/419.html">[2000] 3 FCR 193</a> and the 
  decision of this court on 21 December 2000 in the case of <I>Douglas, Zeta 
  Jones and Northern Shell plc v Hello plc</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>I am in broad agreement with the views expressed 
  by Ward LJ to the effect that the advent of the Convention within our domestic 
  law does not necessitate a revision of the fundamental approach to relocation 
  applications formulated by this court and consistently applied over so many 
  years. The reason that I hold this opinion is that reduced to its fundamentals 
  the court's approach is and always has been to apply child welfare as the 
  paramount consideration. The court's focus upon supporting the reasonable 
  proposal of the primary carer is seen as no more than an important factor in 
  the assessment of welfare. In a united family the right to family life is a 
  shared right. But once a family unit disintegrates the separating members' 
  separate rights can only be to a fragmented family life. Certainly the absent 
  parent has the right to participation to the extent and in what manner the 
  complex circumstances of the individual case dictate. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>But despite the fact that this appeal has raised 
  only the asserted Article 8 rights of the secondary caring parent, we should 
  not lose sight of the Article 8 rights of the primary carer, although not 
  specifically asserted in argument. However an appeal may well arise in which a 
  disappointed applicant will contend that section 13(1)(b) of the Children Act 
  1989 imposes a disproportionate restriction on a parent's right to determine 
  her place of habitual residence. This right was recognised by the decision of 
  this court in <I>Re E (Imposition of Conditions)</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/3084.html">[1997] 2 FLR 638</a> within 
  the confines of the jurisdiction of the court and indeed beyond within the 
  United Kingdom. But why should the same right not extend to anywhere within 
  the European Union (having regard to Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome) or, 
  beyond that, within wider Europe? From that point to a right to world-wide 
  mobility seems but a short step. The European Convention does specifically 
  recognise this right of mobility in Article 2 of Protocol 4 which provides: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"1. Everyone lawfully within the territory of a state shall, 
    within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to 
    choose his residence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>2. Everybody shall be free to leave any country, including his 
    own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>3. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these 
    rights other than such as are in accordance with law and are necessary in a 
    democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, 
    for the maintenance of public order, for the prevention of crime, for the 
    protection of health and morals, or for the protection of the rights and 
    freedom of others."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>Although Protocol 4 has yet to be ratified by the 
  United Kingdom, it undoubtedly lends force to the argument that a failure or 
  refusal to recognise a right of mobility beyond the somewhat fortuitous 
  jurisdictional boundary represents a stance of disproportionate parochialism. 
  Although for the purposes of this appeal this paragraph is digressive it does 
  serve to illustrate the generalisation that each member of the fractured 
  family has rights to assert and that in balancing them the court must adhere 
  to the paramouncy of the welfare principle. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>The acknowledgement of child welfare as paramount 
  must be common to most if not all judicial systems within the Council of 
  Europe. It is of course enshrined in Article 3(1) of the United Nations 
  Convention on the Rights of a Child. Accordingly the jurisprudence of the 
  European Court of Human Rights inevitably recognises the paramouncy principle, 
  albeit not expressed in the language of our domestic statute. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>In <I>Johansen v Norway</I> [1996] 23 EHRR 33 the 
  court held that 'particular weight should be attached to the best interests of 
  the child .... which may override those of the parent ....'. In <I>L v 
  Finland</I> Application No 25651/94 (27 April 2000) the court stressed that 
  'the consideration of what is in the best interests of the child is of crucial 
  importance'. In <I>Scott v UK</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/698.html">[2000] 1 FLR 958</a>, a case concerned with 
  whether the mother's Article 8 rights had been breached by a local authority 
  who had applied to free her child for adoption, the court once again stated 
  that 'the best interests of the child is always of crucial importance'. As 
  early as 1988, the House of Lords stated that the European Convention in no 
  way conflicted with the requirements in English law that in all matters 
  concerning the upbringing of a child, welfare was paramount (<I>Re KD (A 
  Minor) (Ward: Termination of Access</I>) [1988] AC 806. This has been restated 
  recently in <I>Dawson v Wearmouth</I> <A 
  href="../../../../../uk/cases/UKHL/1999/18.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/18.html">[1999] 1 FLR 1167</a></A>, 
  <I>Re A (Adoption: Mother's Objections)</I> [2000] 1 FLR 665 and <I>Re N 
  (Leave to withdraw care proceedings)</I> [2000] 1 FCR 258. I take this 
  succinct review of the relevant authorities both in the Strasbourg and London 
  jurisprudence from paragraph 11 of Miss Hall's skeleton which I cannot better. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>However there is a danger that if the regard which 
  the court pays to the reasonable proposals of the primary carer were elevated 
  into a legal presumption then there would be an obvious risk of the breach of 
  the respondent's rights not only under Article 8 but also his rights under 
  Article 6 to a fair trial. To guard against the risk of too perfunctory an 
  investigation resulting from too ready an assumption that the mother's 
  proposals are necessarily compatible with the child's welfare I would suggest 
  the following discipline as a prelude to conclusion: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) Pose the question: is the mother's application genuine in 
    the sense that it is not motivated by some selfish desire to exclude the 
    father from the child's life. Then ask is the mother's application 
    realistic, by which I mean founded on practical proposals both well 
    researched and investigated? If the application fails either of these tests 
    refusal will inevitably follow.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) If however the application passes these tests then there 
    must be a careful appraisal of the father's opposition: is it motivated by 
    genuine concern for the future of the child's welfare or is it driven by 
    some ulterior motive? What would be the extent of the detriment to him and 
    his future relationship with the child were the application granted? To what 
    extent would that be offset by extension of the child's relationships with 
    the maternal family and homeland?</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(c) What would be the impact on the mother, either as the single 
    parent or as a new wife, of a refusal of her realistic proposal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(d) The outcome of the second and third appraisals must then be 
    brought into an overriding review of the child's welfare as the paramount 
    consideration, directed by the statutory checklist insofar as 
  appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>In suggesting such a discipline I would not wish 
  to be thought to have diminished the importance that this court has 
  consistently attached to the emotional and psychological well-being of the 
  primary carer. In any evaluation of the welfare of the child as the paramount 
  consideration great weight must be given to this factor. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>Cross Applications</P>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>In very many cases the mother's application to 
  relocate provokes a cross application by the father for a variation of the 
  residence order in his favour. Such cross applications may be largely tactical 
  to enable the strategist to cross examine along the lines of: what will you do 
  if your application is refused? If the mother responds by saying that she will 
  remain with the child then the cross examiner feels that he has demonstrated 
  that the impact of refusal upon the mother would not be that significant. If 
  on the other hand she says that she herself will go nevertheless then the 
  cross examiner feels that he has demonstrated that the mother is shallow, or 
  uncaring or self-centred. But experienced family judges are well used to 
  tactics and will readily distinguish between the cross application that has 
  some pre-existing foundation and one that is purely tactical. There are 
  probably dangers in compartmentalising the two applications. As far as 
  possible they should be tried and decided together. The judge in the end must 
  evaluate comparatively each option for the child, one against another. Often 
  that will mean evaluating a home with mother in this jurisdiction, against a 
  home with mother wherever she seeks to go, against a home in this jurisdiction 
  with father. Then in explaining his first choice the judge will inevitably be 
  delivering judgment on both applications. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>The Present Appeal</P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>It remains to apply all the preceding 
  considerations to the present appeal. First I emphasise the difference between 
  Mr Cayford's case on behalf of the father in this court and in the court of 
  trial. As his written submissions in opening and in closing in the county 
  court demonstrate he made no criticism of the case law nor did he invoke the 
  Human Rights Act. Both counsel invited the judge to decide the issues by 
  applying the <I>Poel v Poel</I> line of authorities to the facts as he found 
  them. Thus the case was essentially fought on the facts. The case in this 
  court has been fought on an entirely different basis. Mr Cayford has not 
  criticised the judge's findings of fact, save in one respect to which I will 
  return. Rather he has made a full scale attack on the law, albeit the very law 
  that he invited the judge to apply in the court of trial. Mr Cayford explains 
  this apparently impermissible divergence by pointing out that it would have 
  been futile to question the <I>Poel v Poel</I> line in the county court and 
  further that he was discouraged from raising the ECHR arguments by the 
  preliminary views expressed by this court in <I>Re A</I> [2000] 2 FLR 225. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>So Mr Cayford's first submission to the court is 
  that the approach that has predominated over the last three decades is 
  inconsistent with the Children Act 1989 and with the importance which the 
  courts now attach to maintaining contact between the child and the absent 
  parent. He submits that the <I>Poel</I> approach is understood and applied in 
  the county court as a presumption which it is impossible or difficult for the 
  father to overcome. In consequence there is often no even handed survey of all 
  the factors relevant to the determination of the child's welfare. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>Secondly he submits that the <I>Poel v Poel</I> 
  approach is incompatible with the Human Rights Act and accordingly this court 
  must formulate a new approach which would properly acknowledge the father's 
  human rights. Mr Cayford submits that the culmination of this restatement 
  should be to impose upon the applicant a burden of proof which should be a 
  high one, since she seeks to deprive the child and the father of contact. His 
  subsidiary submissions are that the judge was bound by the findings of fact 
  made by Judge O'Donovan sitting in the Family Court at North Shore in the 
  earlier proceedings in New Zealand. He also criticises the court welfare 
  officer whose enquiry and report was contaminated, as he submits, by a 
  fundamental misunderstanding of the law applicable to relocation cases. He 
  invites this court to give guidance to prevent future contamination. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>In her powerful and comprehensive skeleton 
  argument Miss Hall submits that the <I>Poel</I> approach, properly understood 
  and applied, is perfectly consistent with the rights afforded a father under 
  Article 8 and therefore requires no reformulation. She naturally emphasises 
  that the judge faced a difficult choice in a finely balanced case, he applied 
  the law which the parties agreed, and he reached a discretionary conclusion 
  which it is not open to this court to disturb. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>I emphasise that the trial in the county court 
  took place over three days commencing on the 12 October. The reserved judgment 
  was handed down on 20 October. Its structure is signposted by headings. After 
  an introductory section the relevant history is recorded. The judge then 
  records the present circumstances including the relationship between the 
  mother and her current boyfriend. Mr Cayford submitted that the mother's case 
  was fatally deficient since she had not called her boyfriend as a witness. But 
  on the judge's findings it was no more than possible that he had a future part 
  to play in S's life and the judge was rightly satisfied that his 
  uncertain future role was a sufficient explanation of his absence from the 
  case. The judge then considered the court welfare officer's contribution and, 
  in the light of the criticisms made by Mr Cayford, sensibly distinguished 
  between the first 45 paragraphs dealing with the history and the parties, 
  which he found extremely useful, and the following assessment and conclusions, 
  which he put 'very much on the margins of the case to use as no more than a 
  cross check on his own independent conclusions'. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>The judge then considered and rejected the 
  father's application for a residence order before turning to the mother's 
  application to relocate. He then reviewed the case law, stated the mother's 
  proposals, assessed those proposals, set out the father's objections in full 
  and finally stated his conclusions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>There has been some criticism of this structure. 
  It is said that the judge should not have considered and dismissed the 
  father's application before considering the mother's cross application. Any 
  decision on her application had to give full weight to the alternative future 
  for S proposed by her father. However I can well understand why the judge 
  structured his judgment as he did. The mother's residence order was achieved 
  by consent on 2 June 1999. The father's application for the variation of that 
  residence order in his favour was issued on 24 May 2000. Its foundation was 
  that the mother was not discharging her responsibility satisfactorily and that 
  he could do better. Seemingly the mother's cross application for permission to 
  return home was responsive, having been issued on 14 June 2000. However during 
  the course of argument Miss Hall informed us that the mother's intention to 
  issue had been communicated in correspondence between solicitors prior to 24 
  May. Nonetheless there was some obvious logic in first deciding the father's 
  challenge to the mother's standard of care. If it were well founded at the 
  date of issue then the mother would cease to be the primary carer and without 
  the necessary foundation for a relocation application. Nevertheless I 
  recognise it is impossible to compartmentalise issues in that way; for 
  instance the mother might answer the challenge to her standard by ascribing 
  any shortcomings to the strictures of her life in this jurisdiction. However 
  although it would have been preferable for the judge to have expressed his 
  conclusion on both applications together it is plain from the judgment read as 
  a whole that he never lost sight of the reality that his task was to determine 
  which of the three options was likely to prove least damaging to S's 
  welfare. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>Before considering Mr Cayford's other criticisms 
  and submissions I would like to pay tribute to the quality of Judge Langan's 
  judgment in each and all of its compartments. Clearly he formed a broadly 
  favourable view of the mother. He said of her: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I form the opinion that she is a woman who means what she says, 
    and will adhere to it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=51><A name=para51>Within his assessment of the mother's proposals he 
  made this crucial finding: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Finally, the effect on the mother of being forced to stay in 
    England would, in my judgment, be devastating. Having read and (at length) 
    heard her evidence, I have no doubt that her unhappiness, sense of isolation 
    and depression would be exacerbated to a degree which could well be damaging 
    to S."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=52><A name=para52>That finding led him to his conclusion and its 
  justification in the following paragraph: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"S's welfare is, of course, the paramount consideration. If 
    any single factor which leads to the decision of this case is more important 
    than any other, it is that S's future happiness will be best assured by 
    her being brought up in a place in which the mother is not just content, but 
    happy. This, as much as the balancing exercise which I have had to perform, 
    must lead to my making an order permitting the mother to remove S 
    permanently from England and Wales to New Zealand."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=53><A name=para53>He reached that conclusion having recorded the 
  inevitable reduction in the father's contact, whilst noting that that factor 
  was mitigated by the father's ability to afford the fare to New Zealand two or 
  three times a year and his capacity as a self-employed contractor to organise 
  his holidays. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>Equally impressive is the judge's direction as to 
  the law. Having cited from the decisions of this court in <I>Poel v Poel</I>, 
  <I>Chamberlain v de la Mare, </I>and in <I>Re H</I>, he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I will endeavour to apply these principles to the situation 
    which I have to consider. I will first set out the mother's proposals. I 
    will then examine these proposals with a view to deciding whether they can 
    be said to be reasonable. I will then set out, and make findings about, the 
    father's objections. Finally, I will balance the objections against the 
    proposals and what may be said in support of the proposals and, taking the 
    welfare of S as the paramount consideration, decide whether the mother 
    has made good her case."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>That citation shows that, far from reading the 
  decisions of this court as creating a presumption in favour of the applicant, 
  the judge correctly identified S's welfare as the paramount consideration

  fashion. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>The following conclusions result: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) An analysis of the judgment reveals no misdirection or error 
    of law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) The judge carried out an impeccable investigation of the 
    relevant facts and circumstances as a prelude to clear findings on the 
    mother's reliability, both as a parent and as a witness, as well as upon her 
    proposals and the impact of their rejection both on her and on 
  S.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(c) The judge's discretionary choice of the option least 
    damaging to S's welfare is not open to challenge in this 
  court.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>My view on the wider submissions raised by Mr 
  Cayford in this court has already been made plain. He succeeds in his 
  submission that this court's direction to the effect that great weight should 
  be attached to the impact on the primary carer of the rejection of her 
  reasonable proposals should not be elevated into any sort of legal 
  presumption. But that did not happen in this case and I have yet to see an 
  instance of a trial judge applying the case law in that way. Secondly whilst 
  the advent of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires some revision of the judicial 
  approach to conclusion, as a safeguard to an inadequate perception and 
  application of a father's rights under Articles 6 and 8, it requires no 
  re-evaluation of the judge's primary task to evaluate and uphold the welfare 
  of the child as the paramount consideration, despite its inevitable conflict 
  with adult rights. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=para58>In conclusion I consider Mr Cayford's subsidiary 
  submissions. There can be little doubt that Judge O'Donovan formed a less 
  favourable view of the mother during the course of the proceedings in his 
  court to determine whether she was wrongfully retaining S within that 
  jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention. That 
  leads Mr Cayford to this proposition in his skeleton: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The judge was bound by the New Zealand court's <U>findings of 
    fact</U> in the Hague Convention proceedings by the doctrine of res 
    judicata."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>Mr Cayford advanced no authority in support of the 
  proposition and without authority it strikes me as inherently unsound. The 
  purpose of the doctrine is to prevent unnecessary or repetitive pursuit of 
  issues already decided between the parties. But an order for return will not 
  infrequently lead to an application to relocate issued in the jurisdiction to 
  which the child has been returned. In each case the judge must necessarily 
  survey areas of family history relevant to each proceeding. Equally in each 
  proceeding the judge is likely to have to make some assessment of the 
  credibility and responsibility of the mother, respondent in the first case and 
  applicant in the second. In my opinion the judge in the second application 
  must be free to carry out a fully independent function unfettered by the 
  earlier conclusions of the judge in the other jurisdiction. I do not regard 
  this as any breach of the important principle of comity. The functions of the 
  judges are distinctly different and will require assessments of the adults as 
  they are rather than as they were. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=60><A name=para60>Whilst Mr Cayford was entirely justified in 
  investigating whether or not the court welfare officer had brought a 
  sufficiently independent mind to her task the evidence now available to us 
  persuades me that she is not open to any substantial criticism. Insofar as any 
  criticism is made good it was fully noted by the judge who took great pains to 
  ensure that he was not over influenced by her recommendation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=61><A name=para61>Mr Cayford's case was that the welfare officer had 
  decided that the father's case was almost bound to fail before meeting the 
  parties. This pre-judgment resulted from a note made by another welfare 
  officer of a lecture given by Mr Setright of counsel to members of the Inner 
  London Probation Service. His further complaint was that the court welfare 
  officer had in interviewing the father wrongly used notes which Mr Cayford 
  described, somewhat disparagingly, as a crib sheet. During the course of his 
  cross examination Mr Cayford had sight of the lecture notes and the crib 
  sheet. They were not seen by the judge but they enabled Mr Cayford to put his 
  concerns and criticisms to the welfare officer in the witness box. Mr Cayford 
  wished to resurrect these documents to support his submissions in this court 
  and we received them during the course of the hearing under cover of a letter 
  addressed to the court by Mr John Mellor, the Senior Family Court Welfare 
  Officer at First Avenue House. Mr Mellor confirmed that the lecture notes were 
  taken by the welfare officer's line manager at a seminar given by Mr Setright 
  on the law relating to removal from the jurisdiction. Mr Mellor adds: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The notes were circulated by Mr Hunt among his colleagues who 
    were unable to attend the seminar as an item of interest. I myself have 
    circulated similar notes I have made at other seminars, for example about 
    Islamic family law."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=62><A name=para62>Now interdisciplinary exchanges of this sort are 
  much to be encouraged. Obviously every court welfare officer cannot attend 
  every relevant seminar. The distribution of lecture notes or a full paper to 
  those unable to attend seems to me a sensible use of resources. But this case 
  does illustrate the danger of notes either taken during the lecture or shortly 
  thereafter by a professional from another discipline. Within the three typed 
  pages of the notes there are numerous errors, a few of them of substance. The 
  obvious solution is for the lecturer himself to make available either the full 
  text of the lecture, alternatively an accurate summary of the principal 
  points. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=63><A name=para63>Mr Mellor does not refer separately to what Mr 
  Cayford has called the check-list. The welfare officer accepted that she used 
  this checklist either in preparation for or in the course of her meeting with 
  the father. I am not clear whether she herself was the author of the list or 
  whether it is a list in general use throughout the service. The considerations 
  that the list emphasises seemed to me to be unobjectionable with one 
  exception. The penultimate bullet point is potentially misleading. It reads: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Whilst it is a presumptively child centred jurisdiction, it is 
    not straightforwardly so."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=64><A name=para64>The danger of that sentence is obvious. It needs 
  to be rewritten to state clearly that in relocation cases, as in all cases 
  affecting the future of children the paramount consideration is the welfare of 
  the children. </A>

  <P>Lord Justice Robert Walker:</P>
  <LI value=65><A name=para65>I have had the advantage of reading in draft the 
  judgments of the President and Thorpe LJ and I respectfully agree with both 
  judgments. I wish to add nothing apart from a brief reference to my own 
  judgment (with which Simon Brown LJ agreed) in <I>Re A (Children).</I> In that 
  case, which was heard and decided as an expedited appeal on 1 September 2000, 
  this court dismissed an appeal from His Honour Judge Gee's direction, contrary 
  to the mother's wishes, that two children should go to school at the Lycée 
  Francais in Kensington. <I>Poel v Poel</I> [1970] 1 WLR 1469 was cited but was 
  not the subject of full argument. Since <I>Re A (Children)</I> may be reported 
  I wish to say that the vague doubts which I expressed as to the extent of 
  <I>Poel'</I>s continuing authority (since the Children Act 1989) have been 
  fully resolved by the judgments of the President and Thorpe LJ. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, P:</P>
  <LI value=66><A name=para66>This was an appeal by the father from the grant by 
  His Honour Judge Langan of leave to the mother to remove a little girl of 
  nearly four permanently from the jurisdiction to live in New Zealand. The 
  appeal was expedited and we heard it on the 21<SUP>st</SUP> December 2000. 
  Since the mother had considerable problems of accommodation beyond Christmas, 
  we gave our decision immediately. We dismissed the appeal; refused an 
  application for leave to appeal to the House of Lords and refused a stay. We 
  reserved our reasons for dismissing the appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=67><A name=para67>I gratefully adopt the outline of the facts in the 
  judgment of Thorpe LJ which I have read in draft. Section 13 (1)(b) of the 
  Children Act 1989 requires a parent wishing to remove a child permanently from 
  the jurisdiction to obtain the leave of the court in order to do so. The 
  requirement for leave to remove from the jurisdiction is however long-standing 
  and section13(1)(b) sets out the current statutory position. This application 
  raises difficult emotional issues affecting both parents and their child or 
  children. If, as is so often the case, the departing parent wishes to remove 
  to the other end of the world, for instance to Australia or New Zealand, it 
  will have a dramatic effect upon the relationship between the child and the 
  parent left behind. In a case where the child has a good relationship with 
  both parents but the parent with a residence order has good reasons to settle 
  elsewhere, the decision to be made can be an agonising one. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=68><A name=para68>The general principles established in a line of 
  cases dating back to 1970 have been challenged in this appeal by Mr Cayford, 
  for the father, on the grounds that they are incompatible with the Children 
  Act 1989, and with Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human 
  Rights. He submitted that the effect of the appeal decisions was to raise a 
  presumption in favour of the applicant, requiring the objecting parent to 
  justify his objections. I propose therefore to look briefly at some of those 
  decisions to see how far the principles applied are compatible with section 1 
  and Articles 6 and 8. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=para69>The decision of this Court in <I>Poel v Poel,</I> 
  [1970] 1 WLR 1469, set out the general principles which have been broadly 
  followed in subsequent decisions. In <I>Poel </I>the mother of a child of two 
  and a half had obtained a custody order with weekly access to the father. She 
  wished to emigrate with her new husband and expected child of that marriage to 
  New Zealand. She applied to remove the child permanently from the 
  jurisdiction. If they were not allowed to take the child with them they were 
  prepared to give up their plans to emigrate. The county court judge refused 
  the application. Winn LJ said at page 1473: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I am very firmly of opinion that the child`s happiness is 
    directly dependent not only upon the health and happiness of his own mother 
    but upon her freedom from the very likely repercussions of an adverse 
    character, which would result affecting her relations with her new husband 
    and her ability to look after her family peacefully and in a psychological 
    frame of ease, from the refusal of the permission to take this boy to New 
    Zealand which I think quite clearly his welfare dictates."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=70><A name=para70>Sachs LJ said , on the same page,: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"When a marriage breaks up, a situation normally arises when the 
    child of that marriage, instead of being in the joint custody of both 
    parents, must of necessity become one who is in the custody of a single 
    parent. Once that position has arisen and the custody is working well, this 
    court should not lightly interfere with such reasonable way of life as is 
    selected by that parent to whom custody has been rightly given. Any such 
    interference may, as my Lord has pointed out, produce considerable strains 
    which would not only be unfair to the parent whose way of life is interfered 
    with but also to any new marriage of that parent. In that way it might well 
    in due course reflect on the welfare of the child. The way in which the 
    parent who properly has custody of a child may choose in a reasonable manner 
    to order his or her way of life is one of those things which the parent who 
    has not been given custody may well have to bear, even though one has every 
    sympathy with the latter on some of the results."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=71><A name=para71>That decision was followed in this Court in 
  <I>Nash v Nash</I> [1973] 2 All ER 704 and in <I>Chamberlain v de la Mare</I> 
  [1983] 4 FLR 434. In the latter case, which was an application by the mother 
  with custody of two children to take them with her new husband to New York for 
  his job requirements, Balcombe J, at first instance, having referred to the 
  two decisions of this Court (above), said that he did not propose to be a 
  judicial iconoclast but the only principle which applied was that set out in 
  section 1 of the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971 that the child`s welfare was 
  the first and paramount consideration. He decided that the welfare of the 
  children required the mother to remain in England with them so as to maintain 
  contact with their father. This Court allowed the appeal. Ormrod LJ considered 
  that the judge had misunderstood the judgment of Sachs LJ in <I>Poel 
  </I>(above) and said at page 442: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"What Sachs LJ was saying, I think, is that if the court 
    interferes with the way of life which the custodial parent is proposing to 
    adopt so that he or she and the new spouse are compelled to adopt a manner 
    of life which they do not want, and reasonably do not want, the likelihood 
    is that the frustrations and bitterness which would result from such an 
    interference with any adult whose career is at stake would be bound to 
    overflow on to the children. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In the present type of case I believe that the true balancing 
    exercise must take into account the effect on the children of seriously 
    interfering with the life of the custodial parent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In my own judgment in (<I>Moody v Field,</I> 13 February 1981), 
    the facts of which were not altogether dissimilar from this case, I tried to 
    summarize the position in these words:</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>`the question therefore in each case is, is the proposed move 
      a reasonable one from the point of view of the adults involved? If the 
      answer is yes, then leave should only be refused if it is clearly shown 
      beyond any doubt that the interests of the children and the interests of 
      the custodial parent are incompatible. One might postulate a situation 
      where a boy or girl is well settled in a boarding school, or something of 
      that kind, and it could be said to be very disadvantageous to upset the 
      situation and move the child into a very different educational system. I 
      merely take that as an example. Short of something like that, the court in 
      principle should not interfere with the reasonable decision of the 
      custodial parent.`</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The reason why the court should not interfere with the 
    reasonable decision of the custodial parent, assuming, as this case does, 
    that the custodial parent is still going to be responsible for the children, 
    is, as I have said, the almost inevitable bitterness which such an 
    interference by the court is likely to produce. Consequently, in ordinary 
    sensible human terms the court should not do something which is, prima 
    facie, unreasonable unless there is some compelling reason to the 
  contrary."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=72><A name=para72>Ormrod LJ then referred to the speech of Lord

  the paramountcy of the interests of the child in all these cases. Ormrod LJ 
  pointed out that the decision was first reported in 1969 but its impact might 
  not have been immediately felt. He said at page 443: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"..it may well be that Sachs LJ did not have that speech in the 
    forefront of his mind as we all have. I think he might perhaps have 
    expressed his view slightly differently, making it specifically clear that 
    his judgment was based on the interests of the children which was the 
    paramount consideration."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=73><A name=para73>Griffiths LJ said at page 445: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The welfare of young children is best served by bringing them 
    up in a happy, secure family atmosphere. When, after divorce, the parent who 
    has custody of the children remarries, those children then join and become 
    members of a new family and it is the happiness and security of that family 
    on which their welfare will depend. However painful it may be for the other 
    parent that parent has got to grasp and appreciate that fact. If a 
    step-father, for the purposes of his career, is required to live elsewhere 
    the natural thing would be that he will wish to take his family, which now 
    includes his step-children, with him, and if the court refuses to allow him 
    to take the step-children with him he is faced with the alternative of going 
    and leaving the family behind which is a very disruptive state of affairs 
    and likely to be very damaging to those step-children or alternatively he 
    may have to throw up his career prospects and remaining this country. If he 
    has to do that he would be less than human if he did not feel a sense of 
    frustration and, do what he may, that may well spill over into a sense of 
    resentment against the step-children who have so interfered with his future 
    career prospects. If that happens it must reflect upon the happiness and 
    possibly even the stability of this second marriage. It is to that effect 
    that the court was pointing in the decisions of <I>Poel v Poel</I> and 
    <I>Nash v Nash</I> and it was stressing that it was a factor that had to be 
    given great weight when weighing up the various factors that arise when a 
    judge has to decide whether or not to give leave to take children out of the 
    jurisdiction."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>74. Belton v Belton</I> [1987] 2 FLR343 was an application by a mother 
  to remove a child of two to New Zealand with her new husband, a New Zealander. 
  This Court allowed an appeal against the decision of the trial judge to 
  adjourn the decision whether to give leave for two and half years, until the 
  child reached the age of five and gave leave to remove permanently. Purchas LJ 
  said at page 346:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>".in carrying out the exercise of assessing what was in the 
    interest of A as a paramount consideration, the judge omitted what to my 
    mind was a crucial factor. That factor was the stability of the new family 
    unit in which A was to grow up, the tensions that might be created in it 
    during the ensuing 2 years or so, and the effect that that would necessarily 
    have on A  of great gravity if the union in fact broke up under those 
    stresses and still of considerable gravity if that union came under tensions 
    which would almost certainly arise if the plans to go to New Zealand were 
    frustrated."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=75><A name=para75>And at page 349: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I sympathise and understand, where a lay person such as the 
    father is concerned, the difficulty of reconciliation with the concept of 
    such a separation being in the paramount interests of the child in the long 
    term, but the long term interests of the child revolve round establishing, 
    as Griffiths LJ (as he then was) said in <I>Chamberlain,</I> a sound, secure 
    family unit in which the child should go forward and develop. If that can be 
    supported by contact with the father, that is an immense advantage, but, if 
    it cannot, then there is no reason for diverting one`s concentration from 
    the central and paramount issue in the case.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>I have therefore come to the conclusion that the learned judge 
    erred in law in two ways: (1) in providing for this excessive adjournment on 
    a matter which required immediate decision and was of critical importance to 
    all the family; and (2) that he misapplied the authorities and the law which 
    dictate the hard and difficult decision which must be made once it is 
    established that the custodial parent genuinely desires to emigrate and, in 
    circumstances in which there is nothing adverse to be found in the 
    conditions to be expected, those authorities are quite clear in the course 
    the court must take, whatever the hardship and distress that may 
  result."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=76><A name=para76>In <I>Tyler v Tyler</I> [1989] 2 FLR 158 this 
  Court upheld the decision of the circuit judge refusing to permit a mother to 
  emigrate to Australia where her family lived. In that case the judge found 
  that there was a close bond between the children and their father and that 
  contact between them would cease after emigration. He found that the mother`s 
  wish to remove the children was unreasonable and that she would be able to 
  cope with her disappointment without adverse effect upon the children. Kerr LJ 
  commented that there had not been a reported case in which an application to 
  remove a child permanently from the jurisdiction had been refused. But each 
  case depended upon its own facts. This Court did not interfere with the proper 
  exercise of discretion by the circuit judge. The principles in <I>Poel </I>as 
  restated in <I>Chamberlain</I> were regularly referred to and applied in the 
  courts. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=77><A name=para77>The implementation of the Children Act in 1991 
  gave the courts a larger menu of possible orders and a greater flexibility. 
  The Children Act gave to the majority of parents the new concept of parental 
  responsibility, (see sections 2 and 4) and diminished the impact of a former 
  custody order and the perceived control of the custodial parent over the 
  decision making with regard to the children of the family. In section 8 
  residence orders replaced custody orders and the non-residential parent had 
  greater responsibility and rights over the child during periods of access, now 
  called contact. The earlier emphasis upon the rights of the custodial parent 
  had therefore to be reconsidered in the light of the philosophy of the 
  Children Act. <I>In MH v GP (Child:Emigration)</I> [1995] 2FLR 106 Thorpe J 
  was asked to approve the application of a single mother to remove permanently 
  to New Zealand with her four year old son. The father had regular contact with 
  his son. Thorpe J said at page 110: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>".in approaching the first question, whether or not there 
    should be leave for permanent removal, I apply the principles which have 
    stood largely unchanged since the decision of the Court of Appeal in <I>Poel 
    v Poel</I>. In the later case of <I>Chamberlain v de la Mare </I>a strong 
    Court of Appeal stated that, in considering whether to give leave, the 
    welfare of the child was the first and paramount consideration, but that 
    leave should not be withheld unless the interests of the children and those 
    of the custodial parent were clearly shown to be incompatible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>That statement of principle creates a presumption in favour of 
    the reasonable application of the custodial parent, but in weighing whether 
    the reasonable application is or is not incompatible with the welfare of D, 
    I have to assess the importance of the relationship between D and his 
    father, not only as it is but as it should develop. The relationship with 
    the father is the doorway through which D relates to other members of the 
    family, particularly his half-sister L, his paternal grandmother, and his 
    paternal first cousins. That is the crux of this case."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=78><A name=para78>The judge, on the facts, refused the mother`s 
  application. He also stressed the importance of the child`s relationship with 
  the father and through him with the paternal family. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=79><A name=para79>In <I>re H (application to remove from 
  jurisdiction)</I> [1998] 1 FLR 848, the mother remarried and wished to move to 
  the United States with her new husband, an American. The father had played an 
  unusually large role in caring for the child as a baby and continued to keep 
  closely in touch with her. The judge said that it was a finely balanced case 
  but gave the mother leave to remove the child permanently from the 
  jurisdiction. The father appealed. Thorpe LJ, (as he became), referred to 
  <I>Poel</I> and subsequent reported cases in his judgment and said at page 
  853: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"these applications for leave are always difficult cases that 
    require very profound investigation and judgment. But not a lot is to be 
    gained by seeking support from past decisions, however superficially similar 
    the factual matrix may appear to be. In my judgment, the approach that the 
    court must adopt in these cases has not evolved or developed in any way 
    since the decision of this court in <I>Poel v Poel."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=80><A name=para80>In <I>re C (leave to remove from the 
  jurisdiction)</I> [2000] 2 FLR 457 this Court, (Morritt, Thorpe and Chadwick 
  LJJ) took the same approach, citing <I>Poel, Chamberlain</I> and <I>MH v 
  GP</I>, although they differed on the outcome. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=81><A name=para81>The Human Rights Act 1998 came into force in 
  October last year and all the previous decisions have to be scrutinised in the 
  light of the European Convention on Human Rights. In anticipation of the 
  Convention, on an application for permission to appeal Ward and Buxton LJJ in 
  <I>re A (permission to remove child from jurisdiction: human rights) [2000] 2 
  FLR 225,</I> refused the father permission to appeal. In that case the mother 
  had been given leave by the Recorder to remove a ten month old girl 
  permanently from the jurisdiction to the United States in circumstances where 
  the mother`s job prospects were better in New York than in England. The 
  father, (in person) raised the question of a breach of his right under Article 
  8(1). The Court considered the effect of Article 8 but saw no reason to 
  interfere with the established line of authority followed by the judge and 
  which bound this Court. Buxton LJ doubted whether the difficult balancing 
  exercise performed by the judge came within the purview of the Convention at 
  all. The question whether the Convention applied to private proceedings would 
  appear to me to have been settled by the decision of the European Court in 
  <I>Glaser v The United Kingdom</I>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/419.html">[2000] 3 FCR 193</a> in which a Chamber of the 
  Court held that there were no violations of Article 8 and of Article 6 in a 
  case where a father`s application related to failures in enforcing contact 
  orders both in England and in Scotland. The Court rejected the application on 
  its merits, see also the decision of this Court in <I>Douglas, Zeta-Jones and 
  Northern Shell plc v Hello plc </I>[21<SUP>st</SUP> December, [2000] 
  unreported]. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=82><A name=para82>All those immediately affected by the proceedings, 
  that is to say, the mother, the father and the child have rights under Article 
  8(1). Those rights inevitably in a case such as the present appeal are in 
  conflict and, under Article 8(2), have to be balanced against the rights of 
  the others. In addition and of the greatest significance is the welfare of the 
  child which, according to European jurisprudence, is of crucial importance, 
  and where in conflict with a parent is overriding (see <I>Johansen v 
  Norway</I> [1996] 23 EHRR 33 at pp 67 and 72). Article 8(2) recognises that a 
  public authority, in this case the court, may interfere with the right to 
  family life where it does so in accordance with the law, and where it is 
  necessary in a democratic society for, inter alia, the protection of the 
  rights and freedoms of others and the decision is proportionate to the need 
  demonstrated. That position appears to me to be similar to that which arises 
  in all child-based family disputes and the European case law on children is in 
  line with the principles set out in the Children Act. I do not, for my part, 
  consider that the Convention has affected the principles the courts should 
  apply in dealing with these difficult issues. Its implementation into English 
  law does however give us the opportunity to take another look at the way the 
  principles have been expressed in the past and whether there should now be a 
  reformulation of those principles. I think it would be helpful to do so, since 
  they may have been expressed from time to time in too rigid terms. The 
  judgment of Thorpe J in <I>MH v GP</I> (above) was the first time to my 
  knowledge that the word `presumption` had been used in the reported cases, and 
  I would respectfully suggest that it over-emphasised one element of the 
  approach in the earlier cases. I can understand why the word was used, since 
  in <I>Tyler </I>(above) the reformulation by Purchas LJ of the principles in 
  <I>Poel</I> and <I>Chamberlain</I> may itself have been expressed unduly 
  firmly. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=83><A name=para83>Section 13(1)(b) of the Children Act does not 
  create any presumption and the criteria in section 1 clearly govern the 
  application. The underlying principles in <I>Poel,</I> as explained in 
  <I>Chamberlain</I>, have stood the test of time and give valuable guidance as 
  to the approach the court should adopt in these most difficult cases. It is, 
  in my view, helpful to go back to look again at the reasons given in both 
  those decisions. They were based upon the welfare of the child which was the 
  first and paramount consideration by virtue of section 1 of the Guardianship 
  of Minors Act 1971. The view of both Courts was well summarised by Griffiths 
  LJ in <I>Chamberlain,</I> see above, that the welfare of young children was 
  best met by bringing them up in a happy, secure family atmosphere. Their 
  happiness and security, after the creation of a new family unit, will depend 
  on becoming members of the new family. Reasonable arrangements made by the 
  mother or step-father to relocate should not in principle be frustrated, since 
  it would be likely to have an adverse effect upon the new family. It might 
  reflect upon the stability of the new relationship. The stress upon the second 
  family would inevitably have a serious adverse effect upon the children whose 
  welfare is paramount. Even if there is not a new relationship, the effect upon 
  the parent with the residence order of the frustration of plans for the future 
  might have an equally bad effect upon the children. If the arrangements are 
  sensible and the proposals are genuinely important to the applicant parent and 
  the effect of refusal of the application would be seriously adverse to the new 
  family, eg mother and child, or the mother, step-father and child, then this 
  would be, as Griffiths LJ said, a factor that had to be given great weight 
  when weighing up the various factors in the balancing exercise. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=84><A name=para84>The strength of the relationship with the other 
  parent, usually the father, and the paternal family will be a highly relevant 
  factor, see <I>MH v GP</I> (above). The ability of the other parent to 
  continue contact with the child and the financial implications need to be 
  explored. There may well be other relevant factors to weigh in the balance, 
  such as, with the elder child, his/her views, the importance of schooling or 
  other ties to the current home area. The state of health of the child and 
  availability of specialist medical expertise or other special needs may be 
  another factor. There are of course many other factors which may arise in an 
  individual case. I stress that there is no presumption in favour of the 
  applicant, but reasonable proposals made by the applicant parent, the refusal 
  of which would have adverse consequences upon the stability of the new family 
  and therefore an adverse effect upon the welfare of the child, continue to be 
  a factor of great weight. As in every case in which the court has to exercise 
  its discretion, the reasonableness of the proposals, the effect upon the 
  applicant and upon the child of refusal of the application, the effect of a 
  reduction or cessation of contact with the other parent upon the child, the 
  effect of removal of the child from his/her current environment are all 
  factors, among others which I have not enumerated, which have to be given 
  appropriate weight in each individual case and weighed in the balance. The 
  decision is always a difficult one and has not become less so over the last 
  thirty years. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>Summary</P>
  <LI value=85><A name=para85>In summary I would suggest that the following 
  considerations should be in the forefront of the mind of a judge trying one of 
  these difficult cases. They are not and could not be exclusive of the other 
  important matters which arise in the individual case to be decided. All the 
  relevant factors need to be considered, including the points I make below, so 
  far as they are relevant, and weighed in the balance. The points I make are 
  obvious but in view of the arguments presented to us in this case, it may be 
  worthwhile to repeat them. </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) The welfare of the child is always paramount.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) There is no presumption created by section 13(1)(b) in 
    favour of the applicant parent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(c) The reasonable proposals of the parent with a residence 
    order wishing to live abroad carry great weight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(d) Consequently the proposals have to be scrutinised with care 
    and the court needs to be satisfied that there is a genuine motivation for 
    the move and not the intention to bring contact between the child and the 
    other parent to an end.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(e) The effect upon the applicant parent and the new family of 
    the child of a refusal of leave is very important.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(f) The effect upon the child of the denial of contact with the 
    other parent and in some cases his family is very important. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(g) The opportunity for continuing contact between the child and 
    the parent left behind may be very significant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=86><A name=para86>All the above observations have been made on the 
  premise that the question of residence is not a live issue. If, however, there 
  is a real dispute as to which parent should be granted a residence order, and 
  the decision as to which parent is the more suitable is finely balanced, the 
  future plans of each parent for the child are clearly relevant. If one parent 
  intends to set up home in another country and remove the child from school, 
  surroundings and the other parent and his family, it may in some cases be an 
  important factor to weigh in the balance. But in a case where the decision as 
  to residence is clear as the judge in this case clearly thought it was, the 
  plans for removal from the jurisdiction would not be likely to be significant 
  in the decision over residence. The mother in this case already had a 
  residence order and the judge`s decision on residence was not an issue before 
  this Court. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>The Appeal.</P>
  <LI value=87><A name=para87>In the present case the judge in a careful and 
  excellent judgment dealt with all the relevant considerations which arose in 
  this case. He did not rely on any presumption and clearly made the welfare of 
  the little girl the paramount consideration. The mother's reasons for her 
  desire to return to New Zealand were appropriate and entirely understandable. 
  Her situation in England was not a happy one. The judge found that the effect 
  of her being forced to stay in England would be devastating. He found that her 
  unhappiness, sense of isolation and depression would be exacerbated to a 
  degree that could well be damaging to the child. The father who has had a 
  close relationship with his daughter would be able to afford to visit her or 
  have her visit him two or three times a year which mitigated the loss to the 
  child and to him. I can see no fault in the approach of the judge to this 
  difficult case and no grounds to set aside the order which he made. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=88><A name=para88>I agree with the judgment of Thorpe LJ and with 
  his reasons for dismissing the appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <CENTER>Order: Appeal dimissed; no order as to costs; legal aid 
  assessment.</CENTER></LI></OL>
