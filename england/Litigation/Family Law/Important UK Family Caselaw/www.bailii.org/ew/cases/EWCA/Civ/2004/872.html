  <P>Lord Justice Thorpe: </P>
  <P><U>Introduction.</U></P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>On the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> October 2003 Bennett J gave 
  judgment on an appeal brought by Mr McFarlane, the husband, against a 
  periodical payments order at the rate of £250,000 per annum made by District 
  Judge Redgrave in The Principal Registry on the 19<SUP>th</SUP> December 2002. 
  For reasons which I will subsequently examine critically, Bennett J allowed 
  the husband's appeal and, in the exercise of his own discretion, substituted 
  the lesser order of £180,000. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>On the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> January 2004 Bennett J gave 
  judgment on a contested periodical payments claim brought by Mrs Parlour. He 
  awarded her periodical payments at the rate of £212,500 per annum. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>In each case there were three children of the 
  marriage and orders for periodical payments to the children augmented the 
  liability of the husband. There were further orders in each case dealing with 
  ancillary issues that had been contested. However in each case the only 
  fundamental and difficult issue was the quantification of the wife's 
  periodical payments. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>The outcome of these two cases has been much debated 
  by specialist practitioners. It has been said that the cases raise a novel 
  point of principle which may be formulated thus: if the decision in <I>White 
  v. White</I> introduces the yardstick of equality for measuring a fair 
  division of capital why should the same yardstick not be applied as the 
  measure for the division of income? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>Mr Singleton QC's skeleton argument supporting his 
  permission application of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> October on behalf of Mrs 
  McFarlane resulted in the grant of permission on the 4<SUP>th</SUP> December 
  2003. The order was an acknowledgement that the case raised important issues 
  that this court needed to consider, since the permission application fell to 
  be judged by the stricter standards that Section 55 of the Access to Justice 
  Act 1999 imposes. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>The application for permission on behalf of Mrs 
  Parlour was filed on the 6<SUP>th</SUP> February 2004. Permission was granted 
  and arrangements made for the two appeals to be heard together. At a later 
  stage Mr Francis QC for Mr Parlour sought permission to cross-appeal. That 
  application was adjourned to be heard together with the two appeals. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>Subsequently at an informal directions hearing it 
  was agreed that Mr Singleton would present Mrs McFarlane's appeal followed by 
  Mr Mostyn QC for Mrs Parlour. Thereafter Mr Posnansky QC would respond for Mr 
  McFarlane and Mr Francis would then advance his permission application and 
  respond for Mr Parlour. Further agreement was reached for the division of 
  territory between the advocates, particularly foreign authority, to make the 
  best use of the two days allocated to the appeals. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>McFarlane v. McFarlane.</U></P>
  <P><U>The facts.</U></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>The parties are forty-four years of age. They 
  married in September 1984 after two years of co-habitation. Their three 
  children are aged respectively fifteen, thirteen and eight and are educated at 
  fee-paying schools. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>At the outset of their co-habitation in 1982, the 
  husband was a trainee chartered accountant working for a leading international 
  firm; and the wife was a trainee solicitor with a leading city firm. By the 
  date of their marriage they had both qualified in their respective 
  professions. The husband has throughout remained with the firm with which he 
  trained. In advancing her career the wife moved to work for a large venture 
  capital company and then in due course moved to another leading city firm. She 
  returned to work soon after the birth of her first child but the couple agreed 
  that she should not return to work after the birth of her second child in 
  1991. The husband had become a partner in 1990 and the understandable 
  agreement was that the wife should abandon her legal career in order to devote 
  all her time and energy to their two babies and the developing family. The 
  husband's prospects would amply provide for the family's financial needs. In 
  one sense this was a substantial sacrifice on the wife's part, since in the 
  years prior to the husband achieving partnership she had earned as much or 
  more than he. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>In 1994 the couple bought in the wife's name a 
  house in Barnes which remains the home for the wife and the children to this 
  day. It was purchased with a substantial mortgage which they planned to 
  discharge over five years. Shortly after that was achieved in 1999 the couple 
  purchased in their joint names a holiday home in Salcombe. At the date of the 
  trial before the district judge the house in Barnes was valued at £1.5M and 
  the Salcombe home at about £250,000. In January 2001 the parties separated, 
  the husband having purchased in June 2000 a flat in Clerkenwell for £415,000, 
  financed by a tax-efficient partnership loan paid off over approximately 
  eighteen months. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>The husband formed a relationship with one of his 
  partners and in August 2002 they purchased in the ratio of their respective 
  financial contributions a house in Barnes for £2.94M inclusive of costs. The 
  husband sold his flat in Clerkenwell and his new partner sold her flat. Again 
  the purchase was largely financed by a substantial mortgage and by 
  tax-efficient partnership loans. Their anticipation is that the mortgage will 
  be paid off over five years. The husband planned to spend nearly £350,000 from 
  his net income in payment of interest and repayment of capital. This was 
  plainly an achievable target given that the husband's net earned income as a 
  partner had increased over the five years between 31<SUP>st</SUP> May 1999 and 
  31<SUP>st</SUP> May 2003 along the following route expressed in thousands: 
  272-427-579-633-753. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>The case before the District Judge.</U></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>Equal division of the family capital of about £3M 
  was agreed. The wife retained the former matrimonial home which represented 
  her half share. Nor was there any disagreement as to the available income. The 
  only question was how the husband's net income of £753,000 per annum should be 
  divided. It was common ground that the husband would pay the school fees and 
  periodical payments fixed at £20,000 per annum per child by the District 
  Judge. What should be the wife's share was the question for the court. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>The wife in her form E quantified her spending 
  needs at about £128,000 a year. The husband failed to complete this section of 
  his form E and declined subsequent requests to do so. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>In her form E the wife sought the payment of 
  instalment lump sums to enable her to accumulate capital in order to fund a 
  clean break. However this approach was soon abandoned. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>It was common ground that neither the husband nor 
  the wife had any significant pension provision and that provision had to be 
  made from future income for the years of retirement. It was not disputed that 
  the wife was entitled to a conventional joint lives order. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>As to standard of living it was agreed that the 
  family had enjoyed a comparatively modest standard of living, certainly until 
  the mortgage on the matrimonial home had been discharged. In the circumstances 
  the husband was able to contend that the budget sought by the wife was 
  considerably greater than the family's spending during the marriage. Questions 
  directed to the wife's budget were to dominate her cross-examination.</A> 
  <P></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>None of the other criteria in Section 25(2) of the 
  Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 was of particular application. On those battle 
  lines the wife sought an order of £275,000 per annum and the husband an order 
  of £100,000 per annum.</A> 
  <P></P>
  <P><U>The Judgment of the District Judge.</U></P>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>Having heard the oral evidence the district judge 
  made some important findings on the disputed areas. These were her findings on 
  contributions: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a)"In terms of contributions, from 1991 to date the husband has 
    been the breadwinner for this family. He has worked extremely hard and has 
    been and continues to be very successful. In 1991 the parties made a joint 
    decision that their children would be brought up by the mother on a 
    day-to-day basis and she would abandon her career. It has been suggested on 
    behalf of the husband that the wife did not enjoy her work and found it 
    stressful; that she willingly gave up her career; implying thereby that it 
    diminished the value of her contribution in running the home and protecting 
    the husband from the day to day stresses of the child rearing. I reject this 
    argument. The value of the wife's contribution is derived from what she did 
    and how well she did it, rather than her motivation for doing it and, in any 
    event, she disputes that she did not enjoy her job. There has not been a 
    scintilla of criticism of the wife, either as a partner or as a mother. The 
    parties contribution to this long marriage has been different but of equal 
    value."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) "Part of the overall circumstances of this case is that the 
    joint decision of the parties to concentrate on the husband's career in 
    order to provide the funding of the family's lifestyle has resulted in the 
    greatest fruits of his endeavours being available towards the end of the 
    marriage and after its breakdown. In effect, the spadework for these rewards 
    was carried out over a long period and it would be unfair to take the view 
    that recent increases in the husband's earnings since the breakdown of the 
    marriage have not been contributed to by the wife. The wife's contributions 
    enabled the husband to create a working environment which has produced 
    greater rewards, in respect of which she should have her fair share. She 
    also continues to make a contribution to the family in her nurturing of the 
    children in a single parent household. That contribution did not come to an 
    end when the parties separated."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>Of the husband's proposed future expenditure the 
  district judge had this to say: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) "The husband has estimated his own financial needs, 
    exclusive of housing costs, at £60,000 to £80,000 per annum, giving no 
    particulars. He plans to pay off his share of the borrowings incurred in the 
    purchase of [his new home] over a five-year period, which will require 
    payments of approximately £347,500 per annum. This is an entirely voluntary 
    responsibility which he is perfectly entitled to take on, but it is not a 
    reasonable one…Doing the best that I can I therefore conclude that he has 
    paid almost half a million pounds more for his housing than in my judgment 
    is reasonable."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) "This would have resulted in the husband having to service 
    less debt than he has actually incurred and I do not consider that the wife 
    and children should be penalised because of the husband's decision with his 
    partner to buy [his new home] which was beyond his reasonable 
  requirements."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>In relation to the wife's earning capacity this 
  was the finding: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the context of this case, the joint decisions made by the 
    parties about how these children should be brought up and financially 
    supported and the husband's earning capacity, it is in my judgment 
    unreasonable to expect this wife to take steps to acquire or improve her 
    earning capacity in the foreseeable future, and that is, at the very least, 
    until [the youngest child] reaches secondary school age, when the matter 
    might be very different."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>This is how the district judge dealt with pension 
  provision: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The taxation concessions available to the husband in obtaining 
    partnership loans to finance the purchase of property are very generous. Tax 
    relief is available to him on all interest repayments on these loans at 
    higher rates and this how he has financed part of purchase of [his new 
    home]. I take the view that, after determining what is a fair outcome in 
    respect of the wife's claim for maintenance, taking into account the eight 
    factors specified in Section 25(2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, none of 
    which predominate over the others, and against the background of all these 
    circumstances of the case, that how the parties choose to spend their 
    available income is a matter for them. I am far from satisfied that either 
    of them intends to provide for their later years by way of conventional 
    pension fund investments."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Finally I record the district Judge's direction 
  and conclusion: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) "The court's fundamental duty is to apply Section 25 of the 
    Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 as amended to all the circumstances of the case 
    in order to arrive at a fair outcome, and I remind myself that fairness does 
    not necessarily mean equality, even where the parties have agreed in 
    principle to an equal division or thereabouts of capital assets."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) "In my view, the appropriate maintenance award for this wife 
    is £250,000 per annum which equates to 33.18% of the husband's present net 
    income. This reflects her needs, obligations and the contribution that she 
    has made over the years of the marriage. It may well need to be revised in 
    later years for a variety of reasons. It is a matter for her whether she 
    chooses to make pension provision, but she will not be able to avail herself 
    of tax-relief on pension contributions while she is not an income tax payer 
    and it is a matter for her whether she takes out insurance to protect her 
    and the children's position in the event that the husband dies or is ill and 
    unable to work."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>Implicit within the district judge's reasoning is 
  first the conclusion that the wife should have the same opportunity as the 
  husband to make provision for the years of retirement and second the 
  conclusion that she should have the means with which to insure herself and the 
  children against the risk of premature cessation of the husband's high 
  professional earnings. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>The judgment of Bennett J.</U></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>Mr Posnansky advanced his appeal to Bennett J on 
  six grounds: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>1. The order was manifestly excessive given that the wife had 
    not put her annual requirements at more than £128,000 per annum.
    <P></P>
    <P>2. The district judge had wrongly allowed for the wife to build up a 
    retirement fund and/or to insure herself against the husband's incapacity or 
    premature death.</P>
    <P>3. The district judge had taken insufficient account of the standard of 
    living during the marriage.</P>
    <P>4. The district judge had taken insufficient account of the husband's 
    need to make provision for his retirement out of present income.</P>
    <P>5. Fresh evidence as to the husband's income for the year ending 
    31<SUP>st</SUP> May 2004 invalidated the rate of £250,000 a year.</P>
    <P>6. The district judge's finding that the husband had unreasonably 
    overspent in housing himself was wrong and miscalculated. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>Miss Lucy Stone QC countered all these criticisms 
  to the judge's satisfaction save one, namely Mr Posnansky's second ground, 
  which, during the course of argument, emerged as a submission that the judge 
  had impermissibly subverted a periodical payments order as a mechanism to 
  provide the wife with additional capital. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>Furthermore it is important to emphasise that 
  Bennett J adopted all the district judge's findings of fact and did not 
  otherwise criticise her approach or her conclusions. That is plain from the 
  paragraph of his judgement in which he explained his decision not to remit to 
  the district judge but to exercise his discretion afresh. In that paragraph he 
  said: -</A> 
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In doing so I shall give the same weight to the Section 25 
    factors as did the district judge. She saw and heard the wife and the 
    husband. She has made important findings to which I propose to be completely 
    loyal. It is clear to me, as I have endeavoured to set out in this judgment, 
    that she placed considerable weight on the wife's contribution both past, 
    present and future."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>The judge's reasons for concluding that the 
  district judge had fallen into error of principle are explained succinctly in 
  the following three paragraphs of the judgment: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>53. "The effect of the order of £250,000 per annum by way of 
    periodical payments for the wife is to give her a sum of money which is 
    arithmetically way, way above her needs. I repeat: her budget of £128,000 
    per annum is not a historical one, but is designed, and has been carefully 
    thought out, for current and future needs. Her needs, of course, are not the 
    be all and end all of her application, for, if they were, that would fly in 
    the face of s.25. The court must apply all the criteria, giving such weight 
    to each factor as the court determines is appropriate in the particular 
    circumstances of the case. However, the fact is that the wife has been 
    awarded a sum so much over her needs that there are only two possible 
    results. Either she spends the difference or she saves the difference. If 
    she saves it, as the thrust of her case suggests she will and she wants to, 
    she is thereby in fact accumulating capital.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>54. Miss Stone, in her excellent submissions to me, specifically 
    conceded that the size of the award gives the wife the opportunity to save 
    if she so wishes. Thus the reality, in my judgment, is that the husband will 
    be paying over to the wife from his resources monies which are likely to be 
    directed into financial vehicles for the accumulation of capital. In my 
    judgment, Mr Posnansky has made good his submission that the effect of the 
    order is to subvert the principle set out in many cases that an award of 
    capital is made once and once only, and that the purpose of periodical 
    payments is maintenance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>55. It is my judgment, with all due respects to the district 
    judge, that, having given the wife an award from which she is likely to be 
    able to save large sums of money and thereby accumulate capital, it is no 
    answer to say, as she did, that it is a matter for the wife whether she 
    chooses to make provision for pension and other matters."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>In exercising his discretion afresh Bennett J 
  substituted the figure of £180,000 per annum for the district judge's figure 
  of £250,000 per annum. His reasons are set out in the following five 
  paragraphs of his judgment which I must cite in full: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>58. "I wholly reject Mr Posnansky's submission that the fair 
    award for the wife is £100,000 per annum. To suggest that the wife in all 
    the circumstances of this case should walk away with £100,000 per annum when 
    set against the husband's net income of £753,000 per annum is, in my 
    judgment, thoroughly mean and would be unfair. It goes nowhere near 
    reflecting the s.25 factors as, I repeat, evaluated by the district 
  judge.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>59. At the end of the marriage the husband's income was rising 
    and rising pretty rapidly. The standard of living was increasing. The 
    husband's income and his standard of living has resulted from what the 
    district judge described at p.20 in her judgment as a result of the 
    "spadework". The wife's contribution is continuing and will continue in the 
    future vis-à-vis the children, something which, following a divorce, is a 
    contribution that is sometimes overlooked or even played down. The district 
    judge did neither and properly, in my judgment, gave it appropriate 
  weight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>60. What figure should then be substituted for 250,000? The 
    quantification of periodical payments is more an art that a science. The 
    parameters of s.25 are so wide that it might be said that it is almost 
    impossible to be "scientific". In my judgment, I would be doing justice to 
    both parties if I award the wife £180,000 per annum by way of periodical 
    payments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>61. The husband may say that still exceeds her budget by a 
    significant amount and thereby I am falling into the same error as did the 
    district judge. I agree that the figure I propose to order does exceed her 
    budget and significantly. But if I am right to reject the husband's case, 
    then I ask the rhetorical question; how else are all the s.25 factors, as 
    evaluated by the district judge, to be given full weight other than by 
    making the kind of award that I propose? The more that an award is refined 
    down closer and closer to £100,000, the greater would be the criticism that 
    I would be devaluing the s.25 criteria (other than the wife's needs) as 
    evaluated by the district judge.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>62. I am sure the parties will understand that no family judge 
    in exercising this jurisdiction can achieve perfection given the width of 
    s.25. He or she can only do his best to get as near to it as possible in the 
    circumstances of any particular case."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>Bennett J also removed the order for the index

  the district judge. That point of detail has not been challenged on this

  <LI value=30><A name=para30>It is important to bear in mind that the judge

  <LI value=33><A name=para33>The issue in this appeal can be relatively briefly 
  stated. Again the division of capital between the parties had been agreed at 
  the Financial Dispute Resolution appointment. The only issue that went to 
  trial was the quantum of the wife's periodical payments order. That issue was 
  directed to be tried by a judge of the Division and accordingly, in giving 
  judgment on the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> January 2004 Bennett J was exercising his own 
  discretion rather than reviewing the prior discretion of a district judge. The 
  case had much in common with the case of McFarlane and by the date of the 
  hearing on the 12<SUP>th</SUP> January both Mr Mostyn for the wife and Mr 
  Francis for the husband were armed with Bennett J's previous judgment. Since 
  the point at issue could not be distinguished, Mr Mostyn had the difficult 
  task of attempting to persuade Bennett J to reconsider and reject his previous 
  statement of principle. Of course he failed, and he then applied to this court 
  for permission to appeal and for the appeal to be heard together with the 
  pending appeal in McFarlane. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>The case before Bennett J took four days and a 
  number of factual issues were contested. However the judge's findings on those 
  issues (such as whether the husband was a gambler and whether he had conspired 
  to conceal one of his streams of income) are of no relevance to the issue of 
  principle raised by this appeal. In the circumstances the relevant facts can 
  be briefly summarised. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>The parties met in February 1990 when the wife was 
  a twenty year-old employed by a local optician. The husband, three years her 
  junior, was an apprentice footballer, having signed a contract with Arsenal in 
  July 1989. Their relationship developed swiftly and, although they did not 
  co-habit, the wife generally slept with the husband at his parents' home 
  several nights a week. The husband progressed with Arsenal to become a 
  full-time professional in March 1991 and to reach the first team in January 
  1992. At the end of 1994 the wife gave up her employment with the husband's 
  encouragement and thereafter became financially dependent upon him. They had 
  announced their engagement earlier in the year. However they did not co-habit 
  until May 1995 when they moved into their first home. Their first child was 
  born in October 1995. In October 1997 their second child was born and they 
  upgraded into their final matrimonial home. The marriage was not in fact 
  celebrated until June 1998. In May 1999 their third child was born. In 
  November 2001 the husband left the home. He has since found another partner 
  with whom he has a one year-old child. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>Under the agreement reached at the FDR hearing the 
  wife took the matrimonial home, a property of modest value in Norfolk and a 
  lump sum of £250,000. Her share represented about 37% of the available capital 
  assets. The affluence all results from the husband's success at Arsenal. On 
  the 16<SUP>th</SUP> August 2001 he signed his current contract which expires 
  on 30<SUP>th</SUP> June 2005. His gross earnings at Arsenal for the season 
  2001/2002 amounted to just over £1.5M. The forensic accountant called by Mr 
  Mostyn estimated the husband to have earned an average of almost £1.2M net for 
  the three years ending 2004/2005. The judge accepted Mr Mostyn's submission 
  that the husband will continue to receive a net income of the order of £1.2M 
  per annum until the expiry of his current contract. The scale of the husband's 
  net income is explained by the fact that such bonuses as he receives in 
  addition to his salary are made available to him through sophisticated and 
  tax-efficient channels. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>The Findings of Bennett J.</U></P>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>I turn now to the judge's findings on the S.25 (2) 
  criteria. In paragraph 26 Bennett J dealt with the age of each party and 
  duration of marriage. His finding comes in the last sentence of paragraph: - 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Accordingly although the marriage only lasted some three and a 
    half years it would not be just, in my judgment, to ignore the fact that 
    their relationship endured for seven or slightly more years."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>Bennett J's assessment of the standard of living 
  during the relationship was as follows: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I am satisfied that compared to the lifestyles of other 
    footballers in the same bracket as the husband the wife and husband in this 
    case did lead a comfortable but not an extravagant way of life."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>Of the wife's contribution he said at paragraph 
  15: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"She is a full time mother of three children aged 8, 6 and 4. I 
    am satisfied that she bore the brunt of bringing the children up whilst the 
    parties co-habited. Furthermore it is obvious that she will have to bear the 
    burden of bringing them up during their childhood. Thus by the time the 
    youngest child is 16 the wife will have had a further 12 years of caring for 
    the children. If the youngest remains at home until she is 18 then the 
    period would be 14 years. That I recognise at once is, together with her 
    past caring for the children, an enormous contribution. I am satisfied too 
    that she has no earning capacity. She told me in evidence that she made no 
    sacrifices in giving up her work with the opticians in 1994 nor has she been 
    disadvantaged in staying at home. She accepted that she had not given up any 
    career. There is no dispute, as I understand it, that the wife was a 
    marvellous mother and ran the household efficiently and looked after the 
    children and the husband to the very best of her considerable 
  ability."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>In his assessment of the husband's contribution 
  Bennett J gave further credit to the wife, as appears from the following 
  paragraphs: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"As to the husband's contribution he was and is a very talented 
    footballer. That sprang from his natural talent, being a member of the 
    Arsenal Football Club, and having the good fortune to be coached by Arsène 
    Wenger, a top class coach. So, strictly speaking, the financial wealth of 
    the family was created by the husband. However, in my judgment, there is a 
    very significant factor in the success of the husband in which the wife 
    played a vital role. The wife has suggested in her evidence that the husband 
    was and is a drinker. From what I have read in the papers and been told by 
    the husband and wife in evidence, I am satisfied that the husband was in an 
    environment where, before the advent of Arsène Wenger in 1996, there was 
    very considerable drinking amongst certain players in the Arsenal Football 
    Club. In the early days I am satisfied that the husband did participate in 
    some of those drinking sessions. However the wife realised that that was the 
    way to ruin and unhappiness and I am satisfied that in about the mid 1990's 
    or slightly later she took a grip on the situation and encouraged and 
    persuaded her husband to move away from that style of living. That rather 
    bland description of what she did probably understates her contribution in 
    this respect. In the mid 1990's the husband gave interviews to the press in 
    which he publicly praised the wife for all that she did to bring him back 
    from the brink.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Thus the wife did make a contribution to the husband's success 
    as a footballer for Arsenal and also for England (in the late 1990's and in 
    2000 the husband played for England and was capped 10 times)."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>Bennett J's assessment of the income, earning 
  capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties has 
  or is likely to have in the foreseeable future is crucial. I therefore set out 
  paragraph 32 of his judgment in full: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"<U>The wife</U> has no income or if she can invest what she has 
    not spent of the lump sum, such income would, in the circumstances of this 
    case, be insignificant. I am satisfied as I have already said that she has 
    no earning capacity now or in the foreseeable future. Her life is bound up 
    with her children and will be for some considerable time in the 
  future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><U>The husband.</U> I have already set out his income and other 
    financial resources. He is secure in a very large income until June 2005. 
    What will happen thereafter is unknown. The husband told me in evidence, 
    which I accept, that after a player reaches the age of 31 and his contract 
    expires, he will not be given a contract which lasts for more than a year 
    but it may be renewed for a year at a time. In June 2005 the husband will be 
    32 years old. So, if Arsenal retain his services, he will be given a year's 
    contract, renewable thereafter. The husband has no plans for his future 
    thereafter. However, it may be that any new contract might not contain such 
    high remunerations, and/or discretionary payments under EBTs may decline or 
    possibly cease. After he has ceased to be a professional footballer- at 
    least with Arsenal- it is likely that his income will decline very 
    considerably."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>Of financial needs, obligations and 
  responsibilities which each of the parties has or is likely to have in the 
  foreseeable future, the judge recorded that the wife's major responsibility 
  now and in the foreseeable future was to look after her children and herself. 
  Having considered the rival submissions as to her requisite budget he 
  concluded: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"However, I am satisfied, looking at needs alone, generously 
    construed, the figure of £180,000 per annum for the wife and the three 
    children is substantially too high. If I were to allow £30,000 for all of 
    the three children and £120,000 for the wife, in my judgment that would be 
    fair and just."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>Bennett J's corresponding finding in relation to 
  the husband is to be found in paragraph 37 of his judgment: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"So far as the obligations and responsibilities of the husband 
    are concerned he now has two families to maintain. However, in fairness to 
    him, he has not suggested that the wife and the children should be in any 
    way disadvantaged by the fact that he has to maintain his partner and their 
    child. In any event I am satisfied that now and for the foreseeable future 
    there will be more than adequate income to properly maintain his partner and 
    child without in any way affecting his primary obligation and responsibility 
    to the wife and the children."</BLOCKQUOTE>

  other Section 25(2) criteria were relevant to his decision. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>Bennett J's Conclusions.</U></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>Bennett J then carefully reviewed Mr Mostyn's 
  extensive submissions, designed to persuade him that his judgment in 
  <I>McFarlane v. McFarlane</I> was erroneous, and Mr Francis's submissions in 
  response. He succinctly stated his conclusions on counsel's submissions in 
  eight numbered paragraphs: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"(1) In exercising the powers under Section 23(1)(a) and (d) of 
    the 1973 Act the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the 
    case, first consideration given to the welfare of the children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The court must, in particular, have regard to the matters 
    set out in Section 25(2).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(3) In carrying out that exercise, the court is entitled to 
    place such importance and weight on each matter in Section 25(2)(a) as it 
    thinks appropriate in the circumstances of the case (see 
  <U>White).</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(4) However, "needs" or "reasonable requirements" is not a 
    determinative or limiting factor in cases where the payor has an ability to 
    pay more than the payee's needs. – (see <U>Cornick No.2,</U> <U>White,</U> 
    and <U>Cornick No. 3).</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(5) Thus the objective implicit in the exercise of the Court's 
    discretion under Section 25 is to achieve a fair outcome in the financial 
    arrangements between the parties, (see <U>White.)</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(6) In seeking to achieve a fair outcome there is no place for 
    discrimination between the spouses and their respective roles. There should 
    be no bias in favour of the money-earner and against the home-maker and 
    child-care, (see <U>White.)</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(7) The English statutory code allows of only one application of 
    capital between spouses. Where, as in this case, capital claims are 
    compromised and receive the court's approval by way of order, they cannot be 
    revisited or reissued, see <U>Pearce</U> and the House of Lords and Privy 
    Council cases referred to therein at paragraph 17.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(8) Where there has been or is to be capital provision made in 
    favour of a spouse then, generally speaking a subsequent or concurrent award 
    of periodical payments ought to be for that spouse's maintenance, and ought 
    not to be used to further distribute monies to the payee so as to give her 
    (or him) savings i.e. capital. But such a factor must yield to a greater or 
    lesser extent to the particular circumstances of the case if fairness so 
    dictates. Thus with that qualification, I broadly accept the thrust of Mr 
    Francis's submissions."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>Applying those principles to his earlier findings 
  these then were his reasons for awarding the wife and children periodical 
  payments in the global sum of £250,000, to be split between the wife and the 
  children by the court in default of agreement between the parties: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In my judgment to confine in this instant case an award of 
    periodical payments for the wife to a ceiling of "needs" or "reasonable 
    requirements" where the husband has the ability to pay more, indeed far 
    more, than the wife's needs would be a faulty exercise of the court's 
    discretion. For that could be to determine her application by reference to 
    only one matter in Section 25(2) and ignore the other matters. I accept that 
    the wife's contribution (as I have found it to be) made a significant 
    difference to the success of the husband. She was part of the circumstances 
    that persuaded the husband to drop the laddish culture and, as she put it, 
    "grow up". Her contributions to the home, and the children, both now and in 
    the future must not be underestimated, overlooked or played down.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The husband's open offer of periodical payments is equivalent to 
    10% of his net income. To suggest that in the circumstances of this case the 
    wife should walk away with £120,000 (for her <U>and</U> the children) when 
    set against her husband's net income of about £1.2 million is thoroughly 
    mean and would be unfair. However, to award her £444,000 because that 
    represents 37.5% of his net income which is the same percentage of the 
    capital she received, would be an unprincipled and unfair award on the facts 
    if this case. She would in one year receive sufficient monies, which, after 
    making provision for her and the children's needs, would leave her with a 
    sum equivalent to her present lump sum or more. If the award were backdated 
    to March 2003 and were to run to June 2005, a period of 2 years and 3 
    months, she would effectively have acquired further capital to the tune of 
    £500,000 and more. That in my judgment could be seen to be blowing a large 
    hole through the middle of <U>Pearce</U> and in the instant case would be 
    quite unwarranted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Thus, in my judgment, the court must seek a way that does 
    justice to the parties and which does not, so far as is possible, impose a 
    glass ceiling on the one hand but which does not hand out capital on the 
    other. It surely must be implicit in the concept of periodical payments when 
    placed next to the concepts of lump sum and property adjustments that where 
    there has been a capital adjustment between spouses in accordance with 
    <U>White,</U> as it was in the instant case, the function of periodical 
    payments should not then or at some later date be seen to further the 
    claimant spouse's ability to mine the paying spouse's income for further 
    capital. I see the force in Mr Mostyn's submissions that my decision in <U>M 
    v. M</U> contains irreconcilable tensions and contradictions. Indeed the 
    decision I will make in the instant case may be subject to the same 
    criticism. But as I endeavoured to explain in <U>M v. M</U>, the 
    quantification of periodical payments is more of an art than a science, 
    given the width of the discretion expressly given to the court by 
    Parliament."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><U>Counsel's submissions on the appeals.</U></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>The skeleton arguments prepared for the appeals 
  demonstrate a great deal of industry, erudition and originality. They address 
  the very general question: what should be the principles governing an award of 
  periodical payments during joint lives or until remarriage in any case where 
  the net income of the payer significantly exceeds what both parties need in 
  order to meet their outgoings at the standard of living which the court has 
  found to be appropriate. Mr Singleton has advanced the arguments 
  unsuccessfully advanced by Miss Stone in the court below. He has reviewed the 
  development of the statute law over the past one hundred and fifty years and 
  he has analysed the manner in which the judges have interpreted and applied 
  those provisions, particularly in recent years. He submits that academic 
  commentators and judgments in the USA support his conclusions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>Mr Mostyn has repeated the submissions that he 
  advanced unsuccessfully in the court below. He advances this cogent criticism 
  of Bennett J's judgment: in <I>McFarlane</I> were the principle asserted by 
  Bennett J sound, then, as he himself partially recognised, his order breached 
  it, albeit to a lesser extent than that of the district judge. What was the 
  rationalisation for the uplift of over £50,000 that Bennett J allowed the wife 
  above her annual need for expenditure? If there were no need that could be 
  categorised as "income" then the surplusage has to be categorised as capital 
  or as income available for the acquisition of capital. He also relies upon the 
  trend of the authorities in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which he 
  submits demonstrate a global shift which Bennett J dismissed out of hand. Mr 
  Mostyn and Mr Singleton each adopted the submissions of the other in areas 
  which, by sensible agreement, only one had tackled. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>Mr Singleton and Mr Mostyn contend for models that

  in <I>de Lasala </I>we have seen the amendments to the Matrimonial Causes Act 
  1973 that introduced Section 25A and Section 31(7)(A) – (F). The effect of 
  those amendments, in cases where capital claims have already been dismissed, 
  is first to impose upon the court a duty to terminate the only continuing 
  financial relationship as soon as that can be achieved without undue financial 
  hardship; and second to empower the court to compensate the payee for the 
  discharge of the periodical payments order with additional capital. So the old 
  principle has to be qualified thus: the original once for all capital division 
  that resulted in the dismissal of capital claims may be supplemented by a 
  later transfer of capital, agreed or judged to be the fair consideration for 
  the dismissal of the surviving claim to periodical payments. So much is 
  implicit in the decision in <I>Pearce v. Pearce</I> and would no doubt have 
  been acknowledged by Bennett J if the cases had not been argued before him 
  primarily as claims for indefinite and continuing periodical payments. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>For reasons which I will develop, in my judgment 
  neither case should have been approached on that basis. In both cases a clean 
  break had been partially achieved and a proper concentration on Section 25A 
  both by the parties and by the court would have provided a short answer to the 
  issue of principle so extensively debated. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>The present appeals are far removed from any norm. 
  In one case the single net income probably exceeds the expenditure of the two 
  households (at a very high standard but excluding housing costs for the 
  husband) by about £550,000 per annum. In the other, the single net income 
  probably exceeds the expenditure of the two households by about £900,000 per 
  annum. It is only the huge excess over need that creates the debate as what 
  are the principles governing the quantification of the payee's award. Only 
  that excess allows the advancement of the appellants' ambitious models. Only 
  that excess renders the respondents' contrary propositions unconvincing. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>There is another feature of the present appeals 
  that must be emphasised. In both cases the past surplus which had been 
  converted into capital assets was divided by agreement. In the one case the 
  division was equal, in the other the earner took about sixty percent. It was 
  the scale of the contemplated future surplus that prevented the complete 
  agreement, namely the clean break dismissing all claims. In both cases the 
  agreement was seen, or should have been seen, as but the first stage in the 
  progress to clean-break. The future surplus could provide the consideration 
  for the dismissal of the wife's outstanding claims. How many years of 
  garnering of surplus would be necessary could not be calculated but only 
  estimated. All depended on the surplus in each of the future years. </A>

  <LI value=59><A name=para59>The Law Commission in their 1981 report

  <BLOCKQUOTE>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority for the needs of the

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"There was, however, a wide-spread feeling amongst those who 
    commented on the Discussion Paper that greater weight should be given to the 
    importance of each party doing everything possible to become 
    self-sufficient, so far as this is consistent with the interests of the 
    children; and we believe that the statutory provisions should contain a 
    positive assertion of this principle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The court has, under the existing law, power to make orders for 
    a limited term, and this power is sometimes exercised when it is felt that a 
    spouse (usually the wife) needs some time to readjust to her new situation 
    but could not or should not expect to rely on continuing support from her 
    husband. We think that it would be desirable to require the courts 
    specifically to consider whether an order for a limited term would not be 
    appropriate in all the circumstances of the case, given the increased weight 
    which we believe should be attached to the desirability of the parties

    appropriate case any periodical financial provision ordered in favour of one 
    spouse (usually the wife) for her own benefit – as distinct from periodical 
    payments made to her to enable her to care for the children – should be 
    primarily directed to secure wherever possible a smooth transition from 
    marriage to the status of independence. We believe that this general 
    objective should be embodied in the legislation."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=63><A name=para63>In my judgment the underlying policy of the

  <P></P>
  <LI value=64><A name=para64>The court's duty to seek a clean-break was 
  replicated in section 31 to make plain that it applied not only at the stage 
  of making the financial provision orders but equally at any later stage when 
  the court considered their variation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=65><A name=para65>The court's powers to bring about the clean-break 
  objective that had not appeared practicable at the first stage were

  The additional powers were set out and considered in the case of <I>Pearce v. 
  Pearce </I>(2003) 2 FLR 1144 and it is unnecessary to repeat that review here. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=66><A name=para66>In any case in which, despite a substantial 
  capital base available for division, clean break is not presently practicable, 
  the court has a statutory duty to consider the future possibility. That duty 
  assumes particular prominence in cases where there is a certain and 
  substantial surplus of future income over future needs. If, as in one of the 
  present appeals, the surplus will be predictably short-lived, the first option 
  for consideration should be the planned progress to clean break by means of a 
  substantial term order open to a later application for extension. The 
  obligation on the parties to achieve financial independence is mutual. The 
  earner must give proper priority to making payments on account out of the 
  surplus income. The payee must invest the surplus sensibly, or risk that her 
  failure so to do might count against her on an application for discharge under 
  section 31(7A) and (7B). Given the mutuality of the obligation, the 
  opportunity and responsibility to invest should, in my judgment, be shared. It 
  strikes me as discriminatory, and therefore wrong in principle, for the earner 
  to have sole control of the surplus through the years of accumulation. The 
  preferred mechanism by which the surplus is to be divided annually must be 
  periodical payments. They are variable, which lump sum orders are not. They 
  can therefore reflect fluctuations in the payer's income. They are determined 
  by the court in the event of dispute. They terminate on the re-marriage of the 
  recipient. The practicality of such an order will depend upon many factors. 
  Essentially the completion of the process must be foreseen within a relatively 
  short span. A term of five years which these cases illustrate may be towards 
  the limit of the foreseeable. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=67><A name=para67>I recognise the validity of Mr Posnansky's 
  argument that because orders for periodical payments terminate on the death or 
  remarriage of the payee the payer's future liability is to that extent 
  contingent. Thus it can be said to be unjust to the payer to order the 
  immediate sharing of surplus on account of a liability which may never 
  materialise. That argument however is of little force where the sharing of the 
  surplus is effected by a periodical payments order and where the duration of 
  the scheme for sharing surplus income on account of the capitalisation of a 
  periodical payment claims is relatively short-term. Furthermore there is an 
  element of speculation involved in any scheme for the capitalisation of 
  periodical payments whether undertaken at the time of divorce or on a 
  subsequent application for variation by discharge. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>Outcome in McFarlane.</U></P>
  <LI value=68><A name=para68>How then do these generalisations apply to the 
  facts of these appeals? In my judgment the resolution of the contest in 
  McFarlane was flawed by a failure to give sufficient weight to the duties 
  created by section 25A. That is perhaps the result of the way the wife's case 
  was advanced. In her form E the wife sought "to achieve a clean-break in 
  retirement" and to that end applied for annual instalment lump sums of £64,000 
  per annum until the year 2017 (a span of fifteen years). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=para69>Three months later that part of her case was 
  abandoned in correspondence on the ground that the scheme presented too many 
  potential complications to be viable. At the hearing before the district 
  judge, five months later, what was sought in Miss Stone's skeleton was "as 
  part of her periodical payments a sum which she too can invest towards her old 
  age." </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=70><A name=para70>It is of course easy to criticise with the 
  advantage of hindsight, but the focus should have been on termination and not 
  on post-retirement provision. The key was the husband's capacity to borrow in 
  a tax-efficient way on the security of his home. Although he had borrowed very 
  substantially to acquire an excessively expensive home, his proposal was to 
  discharge the mortgage over five years by annual instalments of £347,500. 
  Plainly on completion of that exercise he could re-mortgage his interest to 
  finance the clean break. Over the intervening years he could make what would 
  effectively be payments on account. The alternative presentation of a joint 
  lives order adopted by both husband and wife diverted the court's attention 
  from the opportunity to achieve a clean-break years before either party 
  approached retirement. Were this an appeal from a first exercise of judicial 
  discretion I would set aside the judgment below and in the exercise of this 
  court's discretion substitute an order for periodical payments at an increased 
  annual rate for an extendable term of five years. Within the life of the order 
  either side would be free to apply for variation dependent on the fluctuation 
  of the husband's earnings. After five years the court could re-assess the 
  prospects of clean break in the light of: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) The husband's capacity to re-mortgage
    <P></P>
    <P>ii) The extent to which the wife had built up a capital reserve from the 
    surplus of income over expenditure in the intervening years</P>
    <P>iii) The revival of the wife's earning capacity, the youngest child 
    having reached secondary school age.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=71><A name=para71>However this is a second appeal in which we must 
  review the error of principle in the district judge's judgment identified by 
  Bennett J. Accordingly there may be no basis for a fresh exercise of 
  discretion. The discretion exercised by the district judge, if held to be 
  without error of principle, must be restored. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=72><A name=para72>Additionally I would emphasise that the focus on 
  achieving independence without financial hardship at the earliest practicable 
  date is inconsistent with the liberty which the district judge attached to the 
  wife's joint lives order. At p.12 of her judgment she said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"…How the parties choose to spend their available income is a 
    matter for them."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Later she said: - </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is a matter for her whether she chooses to make pension 
    provision…and it is a matter for her whether she takes out insurance to 
    protect her and the children's position in the event that the husband dies 
    or is ill and unable to work."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=73><A name=para73>In my judgment the wife's responsibility to 
  contribute to the financing of the clean-break requires her to put the surplus 
  periodical payments above needs (on the district judge's figures £122,000 per 
  annum) to achieving financial self-sufficiency. The evidence advanced was that 
  the premium on a policy to secure her against the husband's death or 
  disability would be £40,000 per annum. Given the reduction of the years of 
  risk, it would not seem to me reasonable for the wife to spend surplus on 
  insurance. The greater priority is to achieve financial independence. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=74><A name=para74>It follows from the conclusions which I have 
  already expressed that I am not persuaded that the district judge did fall 
  into error of principle in making the order that she did. I acknowledge that 
  her reasoning created the opportunity for the argument successfully advanced 
  by Mr Posnansky before Bennett J but it is implicit in her reasoning that she 
  recognised the wife's entitlement to a fair share of the husband's surplus 
  income, albeit that she did not correctly identify the overriding purpose to 
  which it had to be put. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>Outcome in Parlour.</U></P>
  <LI value=75><A name=para75>In the case of <I>Parlour</I> the imperative to 
  achieve finality is even stronger. The husband's income is substantially 
  greater but the graph is likely to plummet within four or five years, in 
  contrast to Mr McFarlane's prospect of steady ascent until retirement. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=76><A name=para76>Unfortunately the argument at the trial was 
  directed as to the quantum of the joint lives order. The judge was not urged 
  to focus on terminating the wife's financial dependency and it is therefore 
  entirely understandable that he approached the case as he did. However in 
  fairness to Mr Mostyn, in his final written submissions he concluded with 
  these paragraphs: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"32. The court should have little difficulty in concluding that 
    in about 4 years time H will enter his twilight years and that there is a 
    real risk that he will not have husbanded his income responsibly so as to 
    make proper long-term support for his family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>33. The court should also conclude that the prognosis of net 
    income set out by JW in her second report is reasonable (about £1.2m net per 
    annum until June 2003).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>34. Thus the court should conclude that to award W £444,000 from 
    March 2003 to June 2004 from this income, which derives in large measure 
    from a contract signed during the marriage, is wholly fair. It is a 
    reasonable sharing of income. If it enables W to make savings then that is 
    right and proper, on the facts of this case.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>35. W will accept in any future capitalisation that she should 
    bring into account such sum of periodical payments that she is awarded in 
    excess of her aliment. The judgment can make this explicit."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=77><A name=para77>Mr Francis in his submissions was at pains to say 
  that his client was approaching the end of his career at its present exalted 
  height; he was prone to injury; his contract might not be renewed at its 
  conclusion when he will be thirty-two years of age. These considerations only 
  underline the obvious need for a substantial proportion of the income in the 
  present fat years to be stored up against the future famine. Again I conclude 
  that it would be wrong in principle to leave the responsibility and 
  opportunity to the husband alone. The wife's and the children's needs were put 
  at £150,000 by the judge. To award her the global figure of £444,000 per annum 
  sought by Mr Mostyn allows her and obliges her to lay-up £294,000 per annum as 
  a reserve against the discharge of her periodical payments order. I would in 
  this case order a four-year extendable term. Hopefully a clean break will be 
  achievable then on an assessment of the husband's earning capacity at 
  thirty-five years of age and the wife's independent fortune derived from the 
  original capital settlement augmented by the substantial annual surplus built 
  into her periodical payments order in the interim. </A>

  <LI value=78><A name=para78>It is obvious that in cases such as the present 
  the calculation of the amount of surplus income cannot be achieved without 
  first establishing what both the payer and the payee need in order to meet 
  their projected expenditure. In preparation for the trials below both 
  applicants advanced budgets which were generously cast and which at trial were

  <LI value=84><A name=para84>The disposal of the present appeals which I

  Section 25A and the amendments to Section 31(7) introduced by the Family Law 
  Act 1996. That route circumvents the arguments developed both before Bennett J 
  and in the written skeletons submitted on these appeals. That wider

  <LI value=85><A name=para85>I recognise that these areas are of some relevance 
  to the present appeals and are likely to be of greater relevance to a number 
  of other cases, either pending or certain to arise, in which Section 25A is, 
  for one reason or another, not prospectively engaged. A relatively benign tax 
  regime has now been in force for many years and there is ample evidence of an 
  increasing band of very high earners who may not possess a matching capital 
  base. Accordingly I will express my opinion on each of the above topics 
  briefly, in the context of cases in which the income of the party who earns is 
  significantly greater than the combined outgoings of himself and the payee. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=86><A name=para86>It is worth re-emphasising that these are 
  exceptional cases. In the majority of cases the income of the earner is 
  insufficient to cover the outgoings of two households. In many others the 
  single income is sufficient only to provide for both households at a standard 
  below that which the family enjoyed before separation. In many others the 
  income will provide for both amply. In many more it will provide for both and 
  a measure of luxury which each contends is not disproportionate to the 
  standard enjoyed before separation. In all the above instances the respondents 
  are correct in their submission that the court's discretionary judgment will 
  be dominated by an assessment of needs or, for the more affluent families, 
  reasonable requirements. </A>

  <P><U>The evolution of the statutory powers and the definition of periodical 
  payments.</U></P>
  <LI value=87><A name=para87>The statutory power to order periodic sums by way 
  of maintenance first appeared in The Matrimonial Causes Act 1866. At that date 
  a wife was incapable of property ownership, the corollary being that her 
  husband was ordinarily liable for her debts, since she contracted as his agent 
  of necessity. Section 1 of the 1866 Act read: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In every such case it shall be lawful for the court to make an 
    order on the husband for payment to the wife during their joint lives of 
    such monthly or weekly sums for her maintenance and support as the court may 
    think reasonable. "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=88><A name=para88>There can be no doubt that such payments were for 
  the wife's maintenance, that is to say for her necessities, her needs, her 
  aliment. The Married Women's Property Act 1882, which allowed the wife the 
  power to own property independently, did not alter this construction. Nor did 
  the statutory language vary greatly through succeeding reforms. The relevant 
  section of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1965 still provided: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"An order requiring the husband to pay to the wife during their 
    joint lives such monthly or weekly sum for her maintenance as the court

  <LI value=89><A name=para89>There is no doubt, in my judgment, that to that

  meet the wife's needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=90><A name=para90>The Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970

    clear authority on an application for variation (and for an order for a lump

    points, namely that (a) the court should not rely on the judicial concept of 
    'reasonable requirements' as a determinative or limiting factor in cases 
    when a payor has, or acquires, an ability to pay more than the payee's

  <P></P>
  <P><U>The principles upon which periodical payments are to be 
assessed.</U></P>
  <LI value=100><A name=para100>This question I have partially addressed in 
  considering the definition of periodical payments. The respondents' 
  submissions take us back to the 1969 Law Commission report. They cite the 
  following passage from paragraph 83: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Of the criteria mentioned in Paragraph 82(a), (i) [the 
    respective means, needs, earning capacity and financial responsibilities of 
    each spouse] and (ii) [the standard of living of the parties] will be 
    especially relevant to periodic cash provisions; the others to property 
    adjustments and lump sum awards."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=101><A name=para101>The appellants' submissions point out that the 
  force of that citation is diluted by adding the next following sentence: - 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But, as already emphasized, the two types of financial 
    provision cannot and should not be kept wholly distinct, and all criteria 
    are, or may be, relevant."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=102><A name=para102>Thus I do not derive help on this issue from 
  that source. It is almost trite to emphasize that the assessment of periodical 
  payments must be governed by the language of Section 25. No one factor in the 
  Section 25(2) checklist predominates. The submissions of the respondents seek 
  to elevate the applicant's needs to a dominant priority. However in deference 
  to authority they accept that it cannot be aliment or bare needs but some form 
  of enhanced needs. That acceptance leads them into a position that is 
  difficult to defend. How is the surplus above needs to be defined or assessed? 
  Bennett J recognized the difficulty in his judgment and met it by saying that 
  the assessment of periodical payments was an art and not a science. However 
  practitioners rightly complain that art depends greatly upon the individual 
  judge and consequently art imports unpredictability of outcome. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=103><A name=para103>The same difficulty confronted Mr Posnansky. He 
  was fluent in negative statements. He said that there must be no reference to 
  entitlement based on some contribution during marriage without which the payer 
  would not be able to achieve his elevated future earnings graph. Equally 
  proscribed, he submitted, was any reference to compensation for an earning 
  capacity either sacrificed or irretrievably abandoned by agreement during the 
  marriage. The only positive consideration that Mr Posnansky was able to 
  advance as the basis for the assessment of surplus over needs was the planned 
  progress to clean break in implementation of the Section 25(A) duty. Mr 
  Posnansky's inability to suggest any other positive consideration leads me to 
  understand his concept of "needs plus" as the old concept of reasonable 
  requirements, which was the measure for an applicant's capital award for about 
  twenty years. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=104><A name=para104>But why should Lord Nicholls' demonstration of 
  the discriminatory nature of the reasonable requirements measure in capital 
  awards not apply equally to income awards? To cite again the familiar 
  paragraph: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But I can see nothing, either in the statutory provisions or in 
    the underlying objective of securing fair financial arrangements, to lead me 
    to suppose that the available assets of the respondent become immaterial 
    once the claimant wife's financial needs are satisfied. Why ever should 
    they? If a husband and wife by their joint efforts over many years, his 
    directly in his business and hers indirectly at home, have built up a 
    valuable business from scratch, why should the claimant wife be confined to 
    the court's assessment of her reasonable requirements, and the husband left 
    with a much larger share? Or, to put the question differently, in such a 
    case, where the assets exceed the financial needs of both parties, why 
    should the surplus belong solely to the husband? On the facts of a 
    particular case there may be a good reason why the wife should be confined 
    to her needs and the husband left with the much larger balance. But the mere 
    absence of financial need cannot, by itself, be a sufficient reason. If it 
    were, discrimination would be creeping in by the back door. In these cases, 
    it should be remembered, the claimant is usually the wife. Hence the 
    importance of the check against the yardstick of equal division."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=105><A name=para105>Although this paragraph was not written with 
  periodical payment assessment in mind, why should the principle defined not be 
  of equal application?</A> 
  <P></P>
  <LI value=106><A name=para106>My present view is that in this jurisdiction we 
  should not flirt with, still less embrace, any of the categorizations of the 
  defining purposes of periodical payments advanced by academic authors. The 
  judges must remain focused on the statutory language, albeit recognizing the 
  need for evolutionary construction to reflect social and economic change. The 
  statutory checklist and the overall circumstances of the case allow the judge 
  to reflect factors which are said to be inherent in either the entitlement 
  model or the compensation model. But to adopt one model or another or a 
  combination of more than one is to don a strait- jacket and to deflect 
  concentration from the statutory language. Clearly in the assessment of 
  periodical payments, as of capital provision, the overriding objective is 
  fairness. Discrimination between the sexes must be avoided. The crosscheck of 
  equality is not appropriate for a number of reasons. First in many cases the 
  division of income is not just between the parties, since there will be 
  children with a priority claim for the costs of education and upbringing. 
  Second Lord Nicholls suggested the use of the crosscheck in dividing the 
  accumulated fruits of past-shared endeavours. In assessing periodical payments 
  the court considers the division of the fruits of the breadwinner's future 
  work in a context where he may have left the child-carer in the former 
  matrimonial home, where he may have to meet alternative housing costs and 
  where he may have in fact or in contemplation a second wife and a further 
  child.</A> 
  <P></P>
  <LI value=107><A name=para107>Returning to the specific question considered by 
  Bennett J, I doubt the modern relevance of the distinction sought to be drawn 
  between income and capital. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=108><A name=para108>In the 20<SUP>th</SUP> Century social and 
  economic shifts broke down the hallowed distinction which our Victorian 
  forbears drew between capital and income. In days of zero inflation, or even 
  deflation, and before the introduction of income tax, capital assets were 
  invested for the steady yield which produced the income from which family 
  expenditure was met. The spending or the reduction of capital signalled the 
  road to ruin. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=109><A name=para109>In the aftermath of the Second World War rates 
  of tax upon unearned income approached a hundred per cent. The avoidance of 
  such penal rates became for some a paramount objective. In an age when the 
  annual rate of inflation spiralled the acquisition of capital by substantial 
  borrowing, which could often be set-off against earned income otherwise liable 
  to tax, became the ordinary means of acquiring substance, particularly as the 
  rise in property values frequently outstripped the rise in inflation. The 
  consequence has been the erosion if not the elimination of the hallowed 
  distinction between capital and income. What people spend is money which is 
  likely to be derived from a variety of sources. Spending needs may well be met 
  from the sale of capital assets or the realisation of capital appreciation. 
  Provision for the future may be by investment in an income fund or by the 
  acquisition of capital assets held for subsequent realisation. All these 
  realities are well illustrated by the financial arrangements and choices that 
  the McFarlane family have made. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U>The guidance to be derived from judgments and academic analysis in other 
  jurisdictions.</U></P>
  <LI value=110><A name=para110>In my judgment these sources were of only 
  passing relevance to the two appeals presently before us. The respondents 
  stressed that in any event the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian decisions 
  are founded on statutory criteria that differ from the provisions of the 
  Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Nevertheless there can be no doubt that the trend 
  in these common law jurisdictions is towards the recognition of wider 
  purposes, objectives and factors in the quantification of spousal support 
  orders. Nowhere are the needs of the applicant the dominant consideration. I 
  would therefore mark these common law decisions and guard against any approach 
  that would put this jurisdiction out of step where the application of our 
  statutory provisions is open to more than one interpretation. It seems 
  inevitable that a future appeal will require a closer analysis of Commonwealth 
  authority. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=111><A name=para111>The New York case law is in my judgment plainly 
  of lesser relevance. Mr Mostyn sought to persuade us to follow the approach 
  reflected in what he described as the leading and landmark case of <I>O'Brien 
  v. O'Brien </I>(1985) 66 N.Y. 2d 576. There the court assessed the likely 
  excess over average earnings of the husband's future earnings as a medical 
  practitioner. It then capitalized that anticipated achievement and awarded the 
  applicant forty percent of the capital sum payable by eleven equal annual 
  installments. That approach seems to me to be open to obvious criticism in any 
  jurisdiction in which the recipient's entitlement terminates on death or 
  remarriage. I share the misgivings expressed by Coleridge J in recent 
  decisions. In <I>N v. N</I> <I>(Financial Provision: Sale of Company)</I> 
  [2001] 2 FLR 69 he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In the current climate now, where the court is engaged more in 
    dividing up assets than in calculating a party's reasonable needs, there 
    would be logic in trying to calculate and include a figure for any asset 
    which generates a secure income. At its most extreme that might include the 
    valuation of a party's earning capacity. However, in my judgment, the 
    evaluation of such an ephemeral item would be pregnant with problems and 
    lead to endless debate incapable of fair resolution. It would be even more 
    problematic where there was ongoing provision for children."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=112><A name=para112>In <I>G v. G (Financial Provision Equal

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The valuation of a person's earning capacity by its reduction 
    to a fixed figure is not an exercise that can usefully be embarked upon. 
    There are too many imponderables. However, it seems to me perfectly proper 
    to pray in aid, by way of makeweight to an argument in relation to any 
    particular capital division, an earning capacity available to one party or 
    another over and above income generated from the capital being 
  divided."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><U>Orders.</U></P>
  <LI value=113><A name=para113>Given the views which I have expressed on the 
  two appeals, Mr Francis's application for permission to appeal is manifestly 
  hopeless. I would dismiss it. In <I>McFarlane </I>I would set aside the order 
  of Bennett J and restore the order of the district judge without the provision 
  for index linking but for a term of only five years from the date of her 
  order. In the case of <I>Parlour</I> I would allow the appeal and substitute 
  the order sought by Mr Mostyn for the term of only four years from the date of 
  the trial. Obviously during that term the value of the wife's percentage share 
  will fluctuate, and probably reduce, as the husband's earnings vary from their 
  present level. </A>

  <P>Lord Justice Latham:</P>
  <LI value=114><A name=para114>The vast majority of the problems which the 
  courts have to resolve in relation to matrimonial finance involve a difficult 
  exercise in ensuring that limited resources are distributed in such a way as 
  to reduce the financial hardship of divorce as much as possible. But we are 
  dealing in the present appeals with cases where the position is very 
  different. In neither case, however, is there sufficient capital for there to 
  be an immediate solution by way of a clean break. But in both there is, in 
  Parlour's case at least at present, annual income far in excess of the needs 
  or reasonable requirements of the parties. As Thorpe LJ has pointed out, that 
  excess amounts in one case to approximately £550,000 per annum and in the 
  other approximately £900,000 per annum. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=115><A name=para115>Counsel for the husbands both accepted that the 
  wives' entitlement was not restricted to their reasonable requirements, 
  accepting as they did that that would be an unwarranted restriction on the 
  court's discretionary powers bearing in mind the matters set out in Section 
  25(2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Their submissions however came 
  perilously close to submitting that there is little room for other 
  considerations. That applies in particular to Mr Posnansky's argument that a 
  periodical payments order cannot be used as a means to enable a wife to build 
  up capital, as this would cut across the principle established in <I>de Lasala 
  –v- de Lasala </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1979/1979_10.html">[1980] AC 546</a>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=116><A name=para116>I have considerable sympathy, in one sense, for 
  the view that the "reasonable requirements" approach has the merit of being 
  both flexible, in that the word "reasonable" can take into account a number of 
  the matters set out in Section 25(2) and also being capable of pragmatic 
  evaluation. The problem quite simply is that it does not give proper effect to 
  the words of Section 25(2). In particular, in the context of Mr Posnansky's 
  argument, it does not give effect in any way to the provisions of 25(2)(b) and 
  (f) which require the court to look to the future. This not only permits, but 
  in an appropriate case, may require the use of income to generate capital for 
  future eventualities. It is clear that there will be cases where the 
  assessment of the parties' reasonable requirements will be the only sensible 
  route to a fair division of limited resources. But where, as here, there is an 
  excess of income, that can only be part of the inquiry. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=117><A name=para117>It is, however, a necessary part of the inquiry. 
  For it is only by examining the reasonable requirements of both parties that 
  the quantum of the excess can be identified so as to enable sensible decisions 
  as to its disposal to be made. That necessarily involves the husband providing 
  the relevant information to the court. The practice which has developed of not 
  providing that information in cases such as these is, in my view, not only 
  discriminatory but also demeaning to the wife. It concentrates the forensic 
  battle on an examination of the wife's claim in a way which is in my view 
  inappropriate. The exercise required by statute is one which is intended to 
  produce a fair result. I consider that <I>White –v- White</I> [2002] 2 FLR 981 
  applies as much to claims for periodical payments as to capital provision. And 
  an examination of the husbands' reasonable requirements will be part of that 
  exercise. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=118><A name=para118>The problem is that the concept of fairness is 
  elastic and often subjective. Attempts to identify what society would consider 
  to be an appropriate yardstick to use to determine fairness have found the 
  answer elusive. And the material with which we have been provided from other 
  jurisdictions has merely underlined how difficult the search for the answer 
  has proved to be. In the absence of a consensus, decisions will have to 
  continue to be made on a pragmatic, and individual basis, which is inevitably 
  unsettling for litigants and their advisors. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=119><A name=para119>But in the present cases, I agree with Thorpe LJ 
  and Wall LJ both of whose judgments I have read in draft, that the solution is 
  to be found in Section 25A. The duty imposed on the court by that section 
  requires us to consider the extent to which it is possible within the family 
  resources to achieve a clean break. In the present cases, this can only be 
  done by use of periodical payment orders enabling the respective wives to 
  accumulate capital. For the reasons that I have already given, that seems to 
  me to be a perfectly proper use of such an order. Like both Thorpe LJ and Wall 
  LJ, I recognise that this is an approach which was not argued either before 
  Bennett J, or us. I am satisfied, however, that it is the right route to take 
  in order to resolve these appeals. For the reasons that they give, I would 
  allow these appeals in the terms proposed by Thorpe LJ, and dismiss the 
  application for permission to appeal in <I>Parlour</I>. </A>

  <P>Lord Justice Wall: </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=120><A name=para120>I agree that these two appeals should be allowed 
  for the reasons given by Thorpe LJ, whose judgment I have had the advantage of 
  reading in draft. I also agree with the orders he proposes. I add a short 
  judgment of my own partly to reflect the interest which the two cases have 
  generated within the profession, but primarily because we are disagreeing with 
  an experienced judge of the Family Division, who conscientiously applied 
  himself to the arguments addressed to him, and decided both cases on the basis 
  of those arguments. </A>

  <LI value=121><A name=para121>It is a frequent (albeit informally expressed) 
  complaint of judges at first instance that cases argued before them bear

  to voice that complaint in relation to these two appeals.</A> 
  <P></P>
  <LI value=122><A name=para122>Both decisions, one arising by way of appeal 
  from the district judge and the other by way of the exercise of a first 
  instance discretion, were, it seems to me, dictated by what appears to have 
  been an analysis agreed at the bar and then put to the judge. That analysis 
  appears to have been that because there had been in each case (1) a consensual 
  capital distribution by way of lump sum and property adjustment orders and (2) 
  an agreement that the capital distribution was insufficient to bring about a 
  clean break, it therefore followed (3) that there should be indefinite orders 
  for periodical payments expressed to last during joint lives or until the 
  remarriage of the payee or further order of the court. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=123><A name=para123>For ease of reference, although it is not 
  strictly accurate, I will refer to such orders as "joint lives" orders. In my

  case to have been given to, and no substantive argument addressed to the judge

    23(1)(a), (b) or (c), 24 24A or 24B above in favour of a party to the 
    marriage, it shall be the duty of the court to consider whether it would be

    the decree as the court considers just and reasonable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Where the court decides in such a case to make a periodical

    term as would in the opinion of the court be sufficient to enable the party

    termination of his or her financial dependence on the other 
party.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=125><A name=para125>In <I>McFarlane</I>, the district judge recorded 
  the parties' agreement that there was insufficient capital to achieve a clean 
  break, and dealt summarily with section 25A(2) simply stating her satisfaction 
  that this was not a case where the wife could adjust, without undue hardship, 
  to the termination of periodical payments in her favour. Although Mrs. 
  McFarlane had at one point posited a clean break by lump sum instalments of 
  £65,000 per annum indexed linked until 2017, she abandoned that approach 
  before the hearing, and her case was put to the district judge on the basis 
  that there was no reason why she should not receive income at the level of 
  £275,000 per annum net index linked on an indefinite basis to enable her to 
  make provision for the future for herself, for as long as such a level of 
  periodical payments was within Mr. McFarlane's means. Accepting the district 
  judge's award of £250,000 per annum, her case was advanced both to the judge 
  and to this court on the same basis. Section 25A receives only a passing 
  mention in two and a half lines of Mr. Singleton QC's erudite and exhaustive 
  131 paragraph skeleton argument prepared for this court. It was only in his

  a clean break case, and in the context of a submission that joint lives 
  maintenance fixed at a high level was both inimical to the achievement of a 
  clean break and wrong in principle because it included an element for future 
  long term provision by way of capital accretion or pension fund. The same 
  argument, in a slightly more sophisticated form, appears in his skeleton 
  argument prepared for this court. </A>

  <LI value=127><A name=para127>The absence of any reference to MCA 1973 section 
  25A in <I>Parlour</I> is, in my judgment, even more surprising because it was 
  manifest that a substantial question mark hangs over Mr. Parlour's future 
  earning capacity. The judge, being invited to make a joint lives order at a 
  fixed percentage of the husband's net income (a global sum of £444,000 per 
  annum for the wife and the three children) declined to do so, as it seems to 
  me, on two bases. Firstly, on the facts, he held that the husband was likely 
  to put aside significant sums from his income and other interests in the next 
  year and a half, and there would, accordingly, be a "greater capital pot of 
  the husband for the support of the wife and children if his income thereafter 
  declines significantly". Secondly, the judge expressed the view that "the time 
  for (Mrs. Parlour) to seek the court's assistance in mitigating as far as 
  possible risks to her economic livelihood, both present and future, was at any 
  final hearing as to capital. She was not obliged to settle her capital (or any 
  other) claims at the FDR but she did so". Why then, the judge asked 
  rhetorically, should it be possible for her to seek an award for periodical 
  payments way, way beyond her needs (generously interpreted) the effect of 
  which on her own evidence, would give her substantial savings and thus 
  capital? He therefore concluded: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>…It surely must be implicit in the concept of periodical 
    payments when placed next to the concepts of lump sum and property 
    adjustments that where there has been a capital adjustment between spouses 
    in accordance with <I>White</I>, as it was in the instant case, the function 
    of periodical payments should not then or at some later date be seen to 
    further the claimant spouse's ability to mine the paying spouse's income for 
    further capital.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=128><A name=para128>At the same time, of course, the judge 
  recognised the tension between that statement, and the actual order he made 
  which – almost exclusively because of the size of Mr. Parlour's income – 
  substantially exceeded Mrs. Parlour's needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=129><A name=para129>In my judgment, Bennett J's approach is a 
  reflection of the manner in which the cases were presented to him. It is an 
  approach which, in the vast majority of modest income cases, is likely to be 
  correct. However, in my judgment, the conventional joint lives order approach 
  to periodical payments does not fit easily with the highly unusual facts of 
  these two cases, and in particular the two critical factors common to each, 
  namely (1) the absence of sufficient capital to produce an immediate clean 
  break; and (2) the fact that in each case the payer's income is easily able to 
  accommodate periodical payments to the payee, in the judge's words "way way 
  beyond her needs (generously interpreted)". In this context, it seems to me 
  that section 25A was of direct application, and it is unfortunate that its 
  proper application did not form part of the argument. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=130><A name=para130>In his written submissions in reply, Mr. 
  Singleton, it seemed to me, was dismissive of section 25(A). Although a clean 
  break is a "desirable objective", section 25A does not, he argued, justify 
  reducing a wife's entitlement in order to effect a clean break. Thus, he 
  submitted, the obligation on the court is only a duty to "consider" effecting 
  a clean break where "appropriate" and there is not a presumption that there 
  will be a clean break. The correct approach, therefore, is to establish the 
  wife's entitlement by reference to section 25 and then consider whether or not 
  a clean break is possible. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=131><A name=para131>I cannot accept this analysis of the role of MCA 
  section 25A. Of course, any order predicated on section 25A must be fair, and 
  by reference to the terms of the section itself will be an exercise of the 
  court's powers which involves the application of the criteria contained in MCA 
  section 25(2). In my judgment, however, the philosophy of the clean break 
  contained within section 25A, clearly identified by Lord Scarman in his speech 
  in <I>Minton v Minton</I> [1979] AC 593 at 608 (well before the repeal of the 
  section 25 tailpiece) as one of the two principles which inform the modern 
  legislation, is at the heart of the amended Statute. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=132><A name=para132>MCA 1973 Section 25A was enacted at the same 
  time as the tailpiece to the old section 25 was repealed. It is of course the 
  case, as Lord Nicholls points out in <I>White v White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a> at 
  604g that when the tailpiece to section 25 was repealed, nothing was inserted 
  in its place as a mandatory overarching statutory imperative as to the manner 
  in which the court was to exercise its powers under section 25. This does not, 
  however, in my judgment, detract either from the fact that section 25A is a 
  statutory embodiment of the principle enunciated in <I>Minton</I> or from the 
  fact that the clean break, in Lord Scarman's phrase, represents one of the two 
  principles informing the modern legislation. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=133><A name=para133>It is, of course, the case that MCA section 25A 
  uses the word "consider". The omission of the words "to consider whether it 
  would be appropriate" in section 25A(1) would be to cause manifest injustice 
  in those many cases where a clean break is not possible. But the statutory 
  obligation in my judgment is clear. The court has a duty, in every case in 
  which it makes orders for ancillary relief, to consider the appropriateness of 
  exercising its powers in order to bring about a clean break within a 
  reasonable time. This includes in section 25A(2) the particular duty to 
  consider fixed term orders for periodical payments. It seems to me, with 
  respect, that this exercise was simply not undertaken in these two cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=134><A name=para134>Mr. Singleton and Mr Mostyn are, however, I 
  think, right when they submit that a payee's right to periodical payments is 
  to a share of the payer's income which the payee (in each of the current cases 
  the wife) has, through her domestic contribution helped the payer develop. I 
  therefore agree that where the payer's income is sufficiently large (as here) 
  a cut-off point for periodical payments based on generously interpreted needs, 
  thereby leaving a large surplus of income for the payer to do with as he 
  pleases, has no foundation in the Statute and is discriminatory. But the 
  danger of this approach seems to me to be that it runs the risk to 
  re-introducing the repealed tailpiece of MCA 1973 section 25 by the back door. 
  If the payee has, in effect, a vested, life-long interest in such an income, 
  is she not being placed in the position in which she would have been if the 
  marriage had not irretrievably broken down? And is the principle contained in 
  section 25A not being simply by-passed? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=135><A name=para135>I am the first to acknowledge that periodical 
  payments based on a proportion of joint incomes (for example, the old 
  "one-third" rule) was discriminatory and may well have caused injustice to 
  women payees. The balance which, it seems to me, needs to be struck in a case 
  such as the present, is the need to achieve fairness to both wives whilst 
  fulfilling the obligation imposed by section 25A. In my judgment, that is not 
  achieved by open-ended orders of the type sought by both Mrs. McFarlane and 
  Mrs. Parlour. It is achieved by orders which exceed need in amount, and which 
  divide equitably the very large income enjoyed by both husbands. But with that 
  division, in my judgment, comes a responsibility on the payee to use the 
  surplus over needs towards financial independence and self-sufficiency. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=136><A name=para136>Thus, in exceptional cases such as the present, 
  and on the basis of term orders, I have no difficulty in contemplating 
  periodical payments being used by the payee as a means of accumulating 
  capital. That is because I perceive the Part II of MCA 1973 (as indeed it has 
  been perceived from its inception as the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property 
  Act 1970) as a flexible code designed to ensure that its various components 
  are used imaginatively to produce a fair result. In <I>Wachtel v Wachtel</I> 
  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../1973/10.html">[1973] Fam 72</a> at 91, this court described the Act of 1970 as: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>…. a reforming statute designed to facilitate the granting of 
    ancillary relief in cases where marriages have been dissolved ….We regard 
    the provisions of sections 2,3, 4 and 5 of the Act of 1970 as designed to 
    accord to the courts the widest possible powers in readjusting the financial 
    position of the parties and to afford the courts the necessary machinery to 
    that end…. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=137><A name=para137>The theme of flexibility was mirrored in 
  <I>Trippas v Trippas </I>[1973] Fam 134 (see, in particular, the judgment of 
  Scarman LJ (as he then was) at [1973] Fam. 144) and in many of the cases in 
  this court dating from the early days of the Statute. Thus in <I>Doherty v 
  Doherty</I> [1976] Fam 71, this court eschewed technicality when considering 
  the distinction between lump sum and property adjustment orders. Ormrod LJ 
  (whose judgments, as Lord Nicholls commented in <I>White v White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a> at 607 are a valuable source of the jurisprudence of the period) said 
  at p 79: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Whether it is right, or not, to accept counsel for the husband's 
    submission that a clear distinction should be drawn between notices of 
    application for financial provision under s 23 and notices of application 
    for property adjustment orders under s 24, may be doubted. These two 
    sections are, in effect, a statement by Parliament of the code to be adopted 
    by the court in dealing with ancillary relief after divorce generally. The 
    fact that they are two separate sections seems to me to be much more a 
    matter of convenience and drafting than anything else. There is no reason 
    that I can see why any distinction should be drawn between those two classes 
    of relief which the court is now empowered to grant. In my view, these two 
    sections should be, as far as possible, regarded as part and parcel of a 
    single code. It may be very important in many cases when the matter comes to 
    be investigated by the court that the court should be free to make either a 
    property adjustment order or a lump sum order, whichever turns out to be the 
    more convenient in the circumstances. It would be unfortunate, I think, if 
    that degree of elasticity were lost for some technical reason. It is quite 
    plain that the same principles apply in the assessment of claims under each 
    of these two sections. That appears from s 25, and it is equally plain from 
    the judgments in<I> Trippas v Trippas</I> of Lord Denning MR and Scarman LJ. 
    Lump sum orders are alternatives to property adjustment orders, and in many 
    cases one order may prove more convenient than another. I do not think there 
    is any greater difference than that. So, in my judgment, the court should 
    keep technical points of the kind with which we are dealing in this case to 
    an absolute minimum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=138><A name=para138>Of course it is the case that the statutory 
  imperative which both <I>Wachtel</I> and <I>Doherty</I> were serving was the 
  now repealed tailpiece to section 25. But in my judgment, the incremental 
  changes to the Statute over the years since 1970 which have changed its 
  direction and remedied a number of injustices (notably in the field of 
  pensions) have not altered the fundamental approach. The statute is a flexible 
  code designed to enable the court to achieve a fair outcome. Periodical 
  payments are one part of that code. The principle of the clean break is now, 
  in my judgment, contained in section 25A. If, in exceptional cases such as the 
  present, periodical payments can be used to enable a payee to accumulate 
  capital and thus facilitate a termination of financial obligations within a 
  reasonable time, such a use seems to me fair and square within the statutory 
  objective. What do not, however, seem to me to be within the statutory 
  objective in the present two cases are indeterminate and unfocused joint lives 
  orders very substantially in excess of needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=139><A name=para139>Speaking for myself, I do not see this approach 
  as inconsistent with the decision of this court in <I>Pearce v Pearce</I> 
  [2003] 2 FLR 1144. In that case the court was considering capitalisation of 
  periodical payments under MCA 1973 section 31(7B). The judge had construed 
  that section as giving him the power to make an additional capital award over 
  and above that required to capitalise the wife's order for periodical 
  payments. Such an additional award was in conflict with the principle that the 
  capital distribution ordered or agreed on dissolution was once and for all. 
  The present cases seem to me quite different. An award of periodical payments 
  designed to enable the payee to accumulate capital which can then be taken 
  into account when consideration is being given to the sum required to achieve 
  the termination of the order for periodical payments seems to me wholly 
  consistent with the terms of both MCA section 25A (and for that matter, 
  section 31(7B)) and does not conflict with the principle that capital awards 
  are once and for all. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=140><A name=para140>For all these reasons, therefore, I am in 
  agreement with Thorpe LJ that neither order made by the judge can stand. I 
  have found more difficult the question as to what orders this court should put 
  in their place. In <I>McFarlane</I>, however, it seems to me that the outcome 
  is effectively dictated by the fact that the case reaches us as a second 
  appeal, and that the appeal from the district judge to Bennett J was governed 
  by <I>Cordle v Cordle</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1791.html">[2002] 1 WLR 1441</a>. Since I agree with Thorpe LJ that 
  the judge was wrong to interfere with the order of the district judge on two 
  bases: (a) that her order wrongly required the husband to pay over to the wife 
  "monies which were likely to be directed into financial vehicles for the 
  accumulation of capital"; and (b) that the effect of her order was "subvert 
  the principle set out in many cases that an award of capital is made once and 
  once only, and that the purpose of periodical payments is maintenance" it 
  follows that the only course properly open to this court is to restore the 
  order of the district judge. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=141><A name=para141>Despite the affluence of the parties, I am very 
  conscious of the high cost of this litigation to them, and in any event, in 
  practical terms I have doubts about the utility of a further hearing designed 
  to identify a proper level of payments designed to fulfil the objectives of 
  section 25A. In the event, therefore, I am persuaded by paragraphs 68 to 74 of 
  Thorpe LJ's judgment that whilst the district judge did not address her mind 
  to section 25A(1) and left to Mrs. McFarlane the use to which she put the 
  surplus over needs in the order for periodical payments, that is not an error 
  of principle, and thus the proper course is not to remit the matter but to 
  restore the district judge's figure for periodical payments and to substitute 
  for the joint lives order an extendable term of five years. At the conclusion 
  of that period, which should coincide with the elimination of the husband's 
  commitment to repay the mortgage on his property, it will be for the parties 
  to negotiate, or for the courts to determine whether a clean break can then be 
  achieved, and if so on what terms, or whether the term of the order should be 
  extended. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=142><A name=para142>I have found the outcome in <I>Parlour</I> more 
  difficult. Whilst Mr. Mostyn's global percentage has the attractive neatness 
  of matching the level of capital distribution, I am less sure that an 
  arbitrary figure calculated without reference to section 25A will necessarily 
  produce a fair result in four years. At the same time, a further enquiry into 
  the figures is likely to be both expensive and time-consuming, and may well 
  encounter many of the unknown factors which currently confront us. Once again, 
  therefore, I am in the event persuaded that the course proposed by Thorpe LJ 
  in paragraph 77 of his judgment is the correct one. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=143><A name=para143>I end by reiterating a theme of this judgment 
  namely that these two cases are, in my view, exceptional. It may well be that 
  the specialist profession has a number of cases in which a spouse has a high 
  six figure or even seven figure net income which is not matched by sufficient 
  capital to achieve an immediate clean break at the point when the wealth of 
  the family falls to be distributed at the end of the marriage. No doubt, in 
  certain professions (including sport) incomes of the magnitude demonstrated by 
  these appeals are more common than heretofore. However, such incomes remain 
  exceptional. As Thorpe LJ has pointed out, in the overwhelming majority of 
  cases, the income (whether generated by one spouse or jointly by both) on 
  which husband, wife and children have lived together is stretched to meet the 
  needs of two households, and is frequently inadequate to do so. In such cases, 
  the approach of the judge would be unimpeachable. I therefore repeat my 
  agreement with Thorpe LJ that these two appeals arise on exceptional facts. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=144><A name=para144>That said, however, such cases have to be fitted 
  into the statutory framework. In my judgment, the profession, in attempting 
  this exercise, asked itself the wrong question in these two cases. The 
  question was not: what are the principles governing an award of periodical 
  payments during joint lives or until remarriage in any case where the net 
  income of the payer significantly exceeds what both parties need in order to 
  meet their outgoings at the standard of living which the court has found to be 
  appropriate? This question ignores the clear statutory language of section 25A 
  . </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=145><A name=para145>The profession inevitably craves certainty, so 
  that it can advise its clients appropriately. That, of course, is not a new 
  aspiration. In <I>Martin v Martin</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../1977/7.html">[1978] Fam 12</a> in which this court 
  upheld the right of a wife to remain indefinitely in a very modest matrimonial 
  home against the claim of her former husband that it should be sold and the 
  proceeds equally divided, Ormrod LJ said, at p. 20: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>I appreciate the point he (Mr. Aglionby, counsel for the 
    husband) has made, namely that it is difficult for practitioners to advise 
    clients in these cases because the rules are not very firm. That is 
    inevitable when the courts are working out the exercise of the wide powers 
    given by a statute like the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It is the essence 
    of such a discretionary situation that the court should preserve, so far as 
    it can, the utmost elasticity to deal with each case on its own facts. 
    Therefore, it is a matter of trial and error and imagination on the part of 
    those advising clients. It equally means that decisions of this court can 
    never be better than guidelines. They are not precedents in the strict sense 
    of the word. There is bound to be an element of uncertainty in the use of 
    the wide discretionary powers given to the court under the 1973 Act, and no 
    doubt there always will be, because as social circumstances change so the 
    court will have to adapt the ways in which it exercises discretion. If 
    property suddenly became available all over the country many of the 
    <I>rationes decidendi</I> of the past would be quite 
  inappropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=146><A name=para146>No doubt ancillary relief has become more 
  sophisticated since 1977, but the speech of Lord Nicholls in <I>White v White 
  </I>is a timely reminder that the only principled approach is the application 
  of the words of the Statute to the pursuit of fairness. For the reasons given 
  by Thorpe LJ I agree that this approach applies to both capital and income. In 
  my judgment these two cases went awry because the terms of MCA section 25A 
  were not properly considered, with the consequence that an attempt was made to 
  impose joint lives orders in exceptional circumstances to which they were not 
  fitted. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=147><A name=para147>For these reasons, in addition to those given by 
  Thorpe LJ, I would, accordingly, allow these appeals. </A>
  <P></P>
  <CENTER>Order: Appeal allowed. A minute of order to be lodged with 
  court.</CENTER>
