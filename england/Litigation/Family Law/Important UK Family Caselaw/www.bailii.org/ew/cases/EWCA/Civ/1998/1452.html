<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">	JUDGMENT
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">LORD
JUSTICE OTTON:  I shall ask Lord Justice Thorpe to give the first judgment. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">LORD
JUSTICE THORPE:  Mr Johns, the appellant, is 56. Miss Chalmers, the respondent,
is 49. The parties commenced their relationship in 1972 and their first child,
I, was born the following year. Their joint tenancy of 1 Everleigh Street in
North London commenced as long ago as October 1976. It seems that there was a
separation in 1989 when Miss Chalmers left Mr Johns and the home. But they were
reunited again the following year and in July 1991 their second child, A, was
born. It seems that their relationship has always been tempestuous at times and
an incident in October 1996, when the mother's face was slightly cut by a beer
tin that had been flicked or thrown at her by the father, led to the first
issue of proceedings. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">On
12th November the mother was granted an injunction 
<I>ex
parte
</I>
and a power of arrest was attached. However, happily their differences were
made up. Three days later the mother's application was adjourned generally and
in the following month they resumed cohabitation. One of the problems that has
undoubtedly had its impact on the relationship has been alcohol, and
particularly the mother's use of alcohol. It seems that to her great credit in
the summer of 1997 she took responsibility to give up drinking entirely, and
she has been aided in that by the support of Alcoholics Anonymous. We have in
the papers a police report on the involvement of the local station with the
family. That shows that in the last year before the separation, which I will
come to, the station has been called out on four occasions. On 5th April 1997
it was the father who called in the police saying that he had been assaulted.
The officers observed a small scratch to his left arm. The mother was drunk and
abusive to the police. She was arrested and subsequently, when sober, released
without further charge. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">On
2nd November the police were called, again the complainant was the father. The
police observed minor injury to his face and neck. Both the father and the
mother made allegations and the father on this occasion was arrested for his
conduct but released with no further action. There was another call out on 12th
December, again the father complained of assault, again he was observed to have
very minor injury, again the mother was drunk, again she was arrested but when
sober released with no further charge. It seems that on that occasion the
mother had relapsed from her resolution to abstain from alcohol. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
final call out came on 5th May. On this occasion it was the mother who called
the police. On this occasion she was observed to have minor injury. On this
occasion the police seemed to have taken a more robust line, for they arrested
the father and charged him with common assault. Apparently he was bailed on
condition that he vacated the family home pending trial. That trial took place
on 5th June. The Justices acquitted the father and so he was free to return to
the family home. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
mother's emotional reaction is not established but can be imagined. She
exercised her right to leave, taking A with her and sadly that has to date
constituted a final separation. I say that because it does seem very sad that
this couple after 25 years of shared family life and obvious attachment each to
the other should have determined, at least on one side, that a continuing
relationship is impossible. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">There
have been a welter of applications to the court following the mother's
departure. On 11th June she applied for a non-molestation and an occupation
order. On 19th June the father applied for a residence order and an occupation
order. On 13th July she applied for a transfer of tenancy and for a residence
order. Those applications have been before the court either for directions, or
for conciliation or for interlocutory application. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
case came before Her Honour Judge Pearlman on 27th July when she made a contact
order, the effect of which was to allow A's return to stay with her father at
the family home during the summer holidays. Since the commencement of the
Michaelmas School term she has been spending Sunday with her father at home and
being taken to school by him on Monday morning. There certainly has been one
occasion on which she has also spent Thursday night with her father at the
family home, and he has taken her to school on the following morning. How often
that has occurred is a matter of some dispute. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">When
with her mother she is in unsatisfactory temporary council accommodation, which
is said to be a mile and a half from school. The family home is about 10
minutes walk from school. One of the features of this case, which goes greatly
to the credit of the parties, is that both children have done exceptionally
well. They seem to have grown up into well balanced and sensible people. Of
course in I's case that is achieved into adult life. In A's case there is still
a long way to go but she has had glowing school reports and a social worker who
gave evidence to the Court spoke extremely well of her good sense and
resilience. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
mother's application for an occupation order came on for interim hearing before
Judge Pearlman on 3rd September and she reached her conclusion on the following
day. She made an order requiring the father to vacate the family home seven
days later. The father's advisers immediately applied for a stay and for leave
to appeal. That application was considered by this court at an oral hearing on
14th September. The court granted leave to appeal and ordered a stay until this
day's hearing. The court has today the advantage of a transcript of the
judgment of Judge Pearlman, as well as a transcript of evidence given by the
social worker, to which I have already referred, and a transcript of oral
evidence given by the elder child, I. I, who spent a year in Australia in
1997/1998, made a statement for the attention of the court which was actually
dated 4th September, the second day of the trial. Counsel for the mother did
not have it in his possession until a very late stage. The statement suggests
strongly I's competence and his love for each of his parents and his attachment
to the home and to the family. It also suggests a mature capacity to view with
objectivity the failings of each of the parents whom he loves. However, towards
its conclusion he made perfectly plain his view as to where merit lay, since he
expressed his conviction that his mother was adapt at engineering and
manipulating a situation. Unfortunately, that important observation was not
tested in cross-examination because counsel had hardly had the opportunity of
reading the statement, let alone digesting it. It seems that it was equally not
registered by the judge, since she nowhere refers to it in her judgment nor
makes any attempt to evaluate it. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
judge plainly developed during the course of the hearing a clear sympathy for
the mother and a clear antipathy towards the father. Of course she alone has
seen and heard the witnesses and it was exactly her function to carry out such
an evaluation, and I have every respect for her conclusion. However, I do have
some anxiety about her reason for accepting the evidence of the mother in
preference to the evidence of the father wherever there was conflict. For she
expressed herself in these terms: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"I
have to say that I accept I as being a truthful witness albeit somewhat
&#180;blinkered' in favour of his father and I have to say that when I have to
consider the evidence of the applicant and the respondent I prefer the evidence
of the applicant to that of the respondent. It is corroborated to a large
extent by the evidence of I Banks." [It is agreed between counsel that the
judge intended to say I J.] 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">I
simply do not understand, having read his statement and having read the
transcript of his oral evidence, how the judge could possibly have construed
his contribution as being corroborative of the applicant when he was not only
called to support the respondent's case but plainly did so. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Be
that as it may, my principal misgiving in relation to the judge's conclusion
and order is in her construction and application of section 33</A> of the Family</A>
Law Act 1996</A>. This section applies to those cases where the applicant has an
estate or interest in the family home. It is common ground that these two are
joint tenants. In those circumstances the court may, under subsection (3) order
the prohibition, suspension or restriction of the exercise by the respondent of
his right to occupy the residence. Equally under that subsection the court may
require the respondent to leave the dwelling house. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">Now
the exercise of that power is ordinarily governed by subsection (6). Subsection
(6) is in these terms: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"In
deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (3) and (if so) in
what manner, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances including- 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
			(a)
	the
housing needs and housing resources of each of the parties and of any relevant
child; 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
			(b)
	the
financial resources of each of the parties; 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
			(c)
	the
likely effect of any order, or of any decision by the court not to exercise its
powers under subsection (3) on the health, safety or well-being of the parties
and of any relevant child; and 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
			(d)
	the
conduct of the parties in relation to each other and otherwise." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">However,
the following subsection, subsection (7), is designed to cater for an
altogether more extreme situation, where it appears to the court that any
applicant or any relevant child is likely to suffer significant harm
attributable to conduct of the respondent if an order under this section
containing one or more of the provisions mentioned in subsection (3) is not
made. In that more extreme circumstance, the court's discretion is much
confined. The statute says that in such a situation: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"...
the court shall make the order unless it appears to the court that- 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">			(a)	the
respondent or any relevant child is likely to suffer significant harm if the
order is made; and 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">			(b)	the
harm likely to be suffered by the respondent or the child in that event is as
great as, or greater than, the harm attributable to conduct of the respondent
which is likely to be suffered by the applicant or child if the order is not
made." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">So
it seems to me that in approaching its function under this section, the court
has first to consider whether the evidence establishes that the applicant or
any relevant child is likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the
conduct of the respondent if an order is not made. If the court answers that
question in the affirmative, then it knows that it must make the order unless
balancing one harm against the other, the harm to the respondent or the child
is likely to be as great. If, however, the court answers the question in the
negative, then it enters the discretionary regime provided by subsection (6)
and must exercise a broad discretion having regard to all the circumstances of
the case, particularly those factors set out in the statutory check list within
sub-subsections (a)-(d) inclusive. I do not think that the judge perceived that
as being her function. She said at page 11: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"When
I look and consider, as I do, s.33</A>(6) of this Act</A> 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">			&#180;the
housing needs and housing resources of each the of parties and of any relevant
child ..." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">She
continued by finding that neither had any significant resources. She then later
in the judgment said: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"Returning
to the statute when I consider s.33</A>(7), I find that the applicant and [A] are
likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the conduct of the respondent
if they were to live in the same house and if an occupation order is not made." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">It
is apparent from those brief references the judge never clearly focused upon
the alternative nature of these adjoining subsections. She seems to have
treated them as if both were applicable as it were simultaneously to the facts
of the case. I hazard that had she directed herself more closely to the
statutory language, she would have seen that this was not a case that came
anywhere near subsection (7). I do not understand how, had she looked at it in
that light, she could have satisfied herself that either the applicant or A was
likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the conduct of the respondent
if an order under subsection (3) were not made. She herself understood that
this was not in any ordinary forensic language a domestic violence case. She
herself said in relation to a risk that the father might not be rehoused by the
housing co-operative if he lost this tenancy: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"It
is for the housing co-operative to make up its own mind, but I would have
thought that in a relationship that had lasted the length of time it has, the
housing co-operative might not consider the respondent on the few occasions
that I have been able to consider guilty of domestic violence. Certainly it is
not domestic violence as so frequently comes before these courts." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
judge was right so to classify it. This was, in the range of domestic violence,
a very slight case. But the corollary is that it was really not open to her to
find that it was a case that fell within the ambit of subsection (7). Had she
approached the case in relation only to subsection (6), could she in the proper
exercise of her discretion have come to the conclusion that an order requiring
the respondent to leave was justified? It is said by Miss Dodson that this was
only an interim order and that it was only a suspension pending the final
hearing of the cross-residence applications and that it in no way prejudiced
the outcome of those applications. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">The
calendar fixes the cross-residence applications for hearing in this building
commencing 26th October. That seems to me a consideration of the very greatest
relevance to the exercise of the discretion. On that occasion the court will
have before it all the issues and principally which of these two parents, if
they have to remain separate, should have the primary responsibility for A's
care; which of the two, if they must be separate, should have the sole tenancy
of the family home; and whether there should be orders of a more permanent
character under the <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act 1996</A></A>. All those issues will fall for
consideration. As a matter of generality, it seems to me that a court should be
cautious to make a definitive order at an interlocutory stage with a final
hearing only six or seven weeks distant. The gravity of an order requiring a
respondent to vacate a family home, an order overriding proprietary rights, was
recognised in cases under the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act
1976 and a string of authorities in this court emphasise the draconian nature
of such an order, and that it should be restricted to exceptional cases. I do
not myself think that the wider statutory provisions contained in the Family</A>
Law Act 1996</A> obliterate that authority. The order remains draconian,
particularly in the perception of the respondent. It remains an order that
overrides proprietary rights and it seems to me that it is an order that is
only justified in exceptional circumstances. Of course there will be cases
where the character of the violence or the risk of violence and the harm to the
victim or the risk of harm to the victim is such that the draconian order must
be made, must be made immediately, and must be made at the earliest
interlocutory stage. But I simply do not see this case on its facts approaching
anywhere near that category. Conventionally the court has given careful
consideration to the control of domestic disharmony by the imposition of
injunctive orders before resorting to the draconian order. It is to be noted
that in the history of this case, there is clear evidence of such judicial
management having proved highly effective. The judge in this case said: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"No
undertaking by the respondent, as I find it, will protect either the applicant
or [A] as, in my judgment, the respondent either cannot or will not control
himself and he has said, in effect, that he is not wrong in anything he does." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">With
respect to the learned judge, there was no evidence that I can perceive
justifying that conclusion and certainly nothing in the history. It seems to me
that the disharmony, such as it was, was of a character perfectly capable of
control by injunctive order. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">For
all those reasons, I believe that the judge misdirected herself in law, and
equally misdirected herself in the exercise of her discretion. I would favour
allowing the appeal and simply adjourning the applications for occupation
orders to be determined at the principal hearing. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">I
would only say by way of postscript that it does seem, in view of the level of
attachment between the parties, and in view of the interests of both the
children, that it would be very sad if the parents did not at least contemplate
a reference to mediation. Obviously this court has no power to require that. It
is purely a voluntary service. But there are highly specialist and expert
mediation services available to the parties. This court itself has a specialist
family mediation service to which appropriate cases can be referred, not only
appeals that are pending but also appeals which on determination have the
prospect of fruitful mediation to avoid future litigation which will otherwise
inevitably follow. So I would only urge the parties and their advisers to at
least give consideration to the availability of these facilities. Should they
decide that they wish to avail themselves of the mediation services of this
court, they have only to approach the Civil Appeals Office. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">LORD
JUSTICE OTTON:  I agree. I would only add by way of emphasis that in so far as
the learned judge reached her conclusion by virtue of section 33</A>(7) of the Act</A>,
she was wrong in principle to do so. Subsection (7) requires the court to make
an order if it appears that the applicant or child is likely to suffer
significant harm if an order is not made, which is greater than that the
respondent or a child is likely to suffer if the order is made. Thus the
subsection only operates where the child is likely to suffer significant harm.
The expression "significant harm" is also to be found in <A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/s31.html">section 31</A> of the
<A HREF="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/">Children Act 1989</A></A>. In 
<U>Humberside
County Council v B
</U>
[1993] FLR 257, Booth J considered that "significant" meant: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"...
considerable, or noteworthy or important ..." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">In
my view the evidence fell very far short of establishing that A was likely to
suffer considerable or noteworthy or important harm if the order was not made.
There was no real risk of violence or any other harm befalling the child. The
wife had departed from the matrimonial home taking A with her. There was
limited contact with father but by consent. There was arguably some
inconvenience to A by the increased journey time to school. This could not
amount to harm. Consequently subsection (7) did not fall for consideration at
all and the learned judge fell into error by taking it into account. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">When
this matter came before this court on a previous occasion, on 14th September,
it may be that both parties were not present. If they were they would have
heard Evans LJ say this: 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		"It
would not be too hopeful, perhaps, to suppose that, in the light of today's
hearing, the two parties may think that it is in their best interests to
approach this matter as two mature individuals and to consider whether it is
not in the best interests of A, if not of themselves, that they should resume
the relationship which they enjoyed in more difficult circumstances before." 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">I
would echo that sentiment, and in the light of the hearing today I would
express the hope that they would seek the mediation facilities to which my Lord
has referred in order to resolve their differences and, I repeat, in the best
interests of A, who is clearly a much loved child. I too would agree with the
outcome of this appeal. 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
 
<BR></DIV><DIV ALIGN="LEFT">		ORDER:
Appeal allowed. Occupation orders to be determined at the substantive hearing.
No order for costs, save legal aid taxation.
