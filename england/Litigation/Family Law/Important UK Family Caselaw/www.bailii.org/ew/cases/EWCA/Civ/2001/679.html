  <P><B>LORD JUSTICE THORPE: </B></P>
  <P><B>The Facts</B></P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>Mr and Mrs Cowan, the parties to this appeal, are 
  respectively 63 and 61 years of age. For convenience I will hereafter call 
  them the husband and the wife. They met when they were still in their teens. 
  At the date of their marriage on 2 February 1959 they were aged 21 and 19 
  respectively. Both worked for English Electric, the husband as a tool 
  draughtsman and the wife as a tracer. Two months after the marriage they moved 
  into a council house in Stevenage. On 7 July 1959 Andrew, their first son, was 
  born. In 1961 the husband set up his own business as a draughtsman in 
  partnership with a friend. On 4 February 1963 their second son, Timothy, was 
  born. In 1963 they had prospered to the extent of purchasing a house in 
  Stevenage for £3,000. In about 1965 the couple developed a second source of 
  income selling polythene for damp courses into the building trade. The latter 
  was very much a family business and at the trial there was much dispute as to 
  their respective roles. In the mid 1960s the husband launched a company, 
  Hanmere Polythene Limited and at about the same time the husband and his 
  younger brother Jeffrey joined forces. There were three brothers in the Cowan 
  family, Jeffrey being two years younger than the husband and Graham being some 
  seven years younger than the husband. Shares in Hanmere were originally issued 
  as to 51% to the husband and as to 49% to Jeffrey's wife, as his nominee. In 
  the late 1960s Hanmere began the manufacture of polythene bags. At about this 
  period 5% of Jeffrey's share in Hanmere was transferred to the wife and at the 
  same time his remaining shareholding went into his own name. Thereafter the 
  story is one of almost unchecked progress to success in business and with it 
  affluence. This was reflected both in moves to finer homes and to the creation 
  of complex tax avoidance schemes. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this 
  judgment to record the detail of Jersey trusts, Swiss trusts, Panamanian 
  companies and Liechtenstein anstalts. Equally it is unnecessary to detail the 
  moves save for the acquisition in 1976 of a country house, Hadham Grange. The 
  purchase price was £75,000. Its agreed value in 2000 was £1,115,000. No doubt 
  this increase is partly explained by substantial expenditure on improvements 
  over the 25 years that it has been the Cowan's family home. At some stage in 
  the mid or early 1970s the wife ceased to play any part in the business. No 
  doubt she was fully occupied with the home and the needs of the children. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>In February 1997 the husband launched a new venture 
  HD Plastics Limited which commenced trading in 1979. At about the same time he 
  also launched Halcyon Plastics Limited. HD stands for high density which leads 
  me to a simple explanation of the husband's accumulation of a fortune offered 
  by Mr Pointer QC during the course of his submissions. The husband had 
  perceived that buying polythene from a manufacturing source and selling it on 
  at a margin was a trade of limited potential. It was his genius to perceive 
  the potential of bin liners which would revolutionise the collection and 
  disposal of household waste. High density thin plastic he perceived to be 
  particularly fit for the purpose. He also conceived the idea of packing the 
  liners in a roll for stocking supermarket shelves. His final successful 
  innovation was the introduction of drawstrings for closing the bags when 
  filled. The companies specialised in supplying both local authorities and 
  supermarkets. The contribution of Jeffrey to what is a remarkable success 
  story was comparatively slight. It seems that in his mid thirties Jeffrey 
  developed a taste for golf. In Hanmere he soon earned the label of the golfing 
  director, playing little or any active part in the business after 1979. He 
  made no active contribution to HD Plastics or Halcyon, although start-up 
  capital for these companies was said to derive from Hanmere Limited. However 
  Halcyon was essentially a joint venture between the husband and Graham and it 
  was not in dispute that the husband held only 51% of Halcyon, although there 
  was contention as to whether the remaining 49% belonged to Graham or whether 
  the minority shareholding was split between him and Jeffrey in proportions 30 
  to 19. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>The success in business, magnified by the avoidance 
  and evasion of tax, enabled the husband and the wife to develop a very high 
  standard of living. In the mid 1980s the husband and the wife acquired a 
  winter home in the Virgin Islands, Flag Hill, at a cost, after improvements, 
  of about $2M. Jeffrey and his family were provided with a home on a golfing 
  development in the Canary Islands at a cost of about £240,000. All this was 
  financed through the offshore companies. At about this time the husband formed 
  Inca Investment Properties Limited to own factory premises in Biggleswade into 
  which the operations of HD Plastics were moved. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>All this seemingly effortless success ran into rough 
  waters in the 1990s. In 1992 the husband launched a new product, plastic bags 
  with a zip closure, through a company that he had incorporated years 
  previously named Hanlex Limited. This venture sustained substantial losses 
  over the ensuing years until the relatively recent closure of the business. 
  These losses were borne, at least substantially, by Hanmere and led to some 
  disagreement between the husband and Jeffrey, whose income continues to be 
  derived from Hanmere. Of greater significance is the filing of a divorce 
  petition by the wife in 1992, although it was not ultimately served until some 
  six years later. Difficulties in the marriage were contained until March 1994 
  when the parties separated. The husband moved out of Hadham Grange, renting a 
  flat in London. The Caribbean winter home was put on the market. It is 
  probably significant that shortly before the separation the Inland Revenue 
  launched an investigation into the activities of the husband, his companies 
  and the offshore superstructure. Following the separation the husband paid the 
  wife a monthly allowance of £6,600 increased to £8,900 in September 1995 when 
  the wife acquired a three bedroom flat in Florida for her use as a winter 
  home. The husband also provided £16,000 towards the venture. It was in fact a 
  purchase on mortgage although presented to the husband as a tenancy. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>In order to defend himself against the Inland 
  Revenue investigations the husband instructed Foreman Laws who in turn 
  instructed Coopers and Lybrand who jointly reported to the Inland Revenue in 
  February 1996. Their strategy was to present the husband as the single target 
  for the Inland Revenue's arrows with the aim of achieving a sub-standard 
  settlement. A compromise was reached in December 1996. In broad terms the 
  husband agreed to dismantle the entire offshore structure, to pay the Revenue 
  the sum of £2,561,000 and to distribute the shares in HD, Halcyon, Hanlex and 
  Inca (formerly invested in the Jersey trust) between himself and his two 
  brothers. In fact the husband's solicitor, Mr Foreman, issued the shares in 
  these four companies in one parcel of 80% and another of 20%. This was to 
  facilitate a division between the brothers. It was subsequently said that it 
  was by oversight that the minority shareholding in Halcyon was put at 20% 
  only. Whilst Jeffrey's entitlement to a 20% share in HD and Inca was to be 
  heavily disputed, it was never an issue that the husband's shareholding in 
  Halcyon did not exceed 51%. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>Meanwhile HD Plastics was running into difficulties. 
  The husband contemplated the purchase of a complementary manufacturer, Baco 
  Consumer Products Limited (a subsidiary of British Aluminium Limited). In the 
  event it was Baco that acquired HD Plastics. The husband negotiated a deal the 
  subject of a comprehensive shareholders agreement dated 10 October 1997. The 
  basic terms were that the consolidated companies should be marketed as a whole 
  within five years, if possible. In consideration for his shareholding in HD 
  Plastics the husband received loan notes to the value of £4,429,000 repayable 
  at Baco's option or on sale or in equal instalments between 2005 and 2009. In 
  the interim the loan notes bore interest at 5%. In addition the husband 
  obtained 19% of the equity in Baco. Shortly after completing this deal the 
  husband bought a flat in Hampstead for about £0.5M financed by a very 
  substantial building society mortgage. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>The payment of the agreed sum to the Inland Revenue 
  plainly compounded the husband's problems. In February 1997 he raised 
  £635,000: £200,000 from the Jersey trust and the balance drawn from HD 
  Plastics or Inca. In March 1997 £319,000 was paid: £120,000 from Hanlex and 
  the balance from the Swiss trust. In December 1997 the husband drew down his 
  capital entitlement under his pension scheme, £481,000, and the capital 
  entitlement under Jeffrey's pension scheme, £200,000. At the end of 1998 the 
  final instalment of £561,000 was due. The Inland Revenue accepted £50,000 from 
  the husband and a charge on the proceeds of sale of Flag Hill, the Virgin 
  Island home. The husband had agreed a sale at $1,100,000 in September 1998 but 
  only upon the basis that the purchase price was payable over five years. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Litigation</B></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>Whether or not in response to these financial 
  pressures in April 1998 the husband reduced the wife's monthly allowance to 
  £5,000, which led to the service of the petition and an application for 
  ancillary relief. The application proceeded through inevitably elaborate 
  interlocutory development with Mr Lawrence being brought in for the husband 
  and Mr Lobbenberg for the wife. The financial dispute resolution appointment 
  before Bennett J did not lead to compromise and the trial commenced before 
  Singer J on 13 March. The trial seems to have been hard fought, if not 
  acrimoniously. The wife's advisors suspected that the husband had not been 
  frank in relation to his prospects of deriving millions in ready cash from his 
  investment in Baco. On the opening day Miss Baron QC, for the wife, obtained a 
  production order against Baco which revealed that active negotiations for the 
  sale of the company had been proceeding for some time undisclosed by the 
  husband. His response was that he had no participation in the negotiations and 
  was merely a powerless minority shareholder. At the trial Miss Baron submitted 
  that her client was entitled to an equal share of the assets all of which had 
  been acquired during the course of a 35 year marriage throughout which the 
  wife had been an unstinting contributor. The wife stressed that the marriage 
  had been brought to an end by the husband to her great distress. That 
  submission could not possibly have succeeded in that court at that date since 
  clearly the judge was bound by a long line of cases in this court limiting the 
  applicant's award to the capital sum necessary to meet all reasonable 
  requirements. Of course Miss Baron was no doubt mindful of the paper written 
  by Peter Singer QC that challenged the validity of the reasonable requirement 
  ceiling. Equally Miss Baron would have been well aware that the case of 
  <I>White v White</I> was fixed for hearing in the House of Lords some three 
  months later. Undoubtedly at trial Mr Pointer had the easier task since he 
  could rely upon the decision of this court in <I>Dart v Dart</I> where Mr 
  Munby QC had unsuccessfully mounted a full scale assault on the reasonable 
  requirements yardstick. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>When Singer J was ready to hand down his reserved 
  judgment on 28 July there was a further flurry since the possible sale of Baco 
  Limited investigated at the trial in March had progressed to something 
  approaching completion. Issues were finally argued after an adjournment to 31 
  July to enable the wife's advisors to digest the latest report. The order 
  reflecting his judgment dated 31 July was sealed on 11 August. Under its terms 
  the wife received a lump sum of £1,775,000 to supplement and to finance her 
  ownership of Hadham Grange and the Florida flat. Together with her pension 
  fund valued at £245,000, and approximately £50,000 of other net assets, the 
  wife's wealth was elevated to approximately £3.2M. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>The main issues that had been fought out at the 
  trial were, perhaps, whether the wife had made an outstanding contribution to 
  the success of the companies, in addition to her contribution as wife and 
  mother, and whether Jeffrey had a legal entitlement to a 20% share in the 
  other companies in addition to his 44% share in Hanmere. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>On the first issue the judge's findings were as 
  follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The first, and major, issue upon which I must reach conclusions 
    is the nature, duration and effect of the wife's contributions to the 
    family's wealth. For she maintains and lays heavy emphasis upon her claim 
    that she played a vital role in the inception of the business which was to 
    provide the family's fortune. She maintains that her input to the 
    development of the business was so significant that it is the major factor 
    which should be reflected in the outcome of her application, and which 
    should enhance her award over and above that full entitlement which it is 
    conceded she should enjoy.
    <P></P>
    <P>It is common ground that the business started with the wife purchasing 
    polythene sheeting from a wholesaler for re-sale to builders whom she 
    canvassed for purchases. Little if any capital outlay was involved, little 
    if any bookkeeping was required, and this trade developed as a side-line to 
    meet the twin objectives of giving the wife something to absorb her energies 
    besides home and children, plus the opportunity to contribute to what was 
    the parties' modest budget. For this the wife deserves credit, which indeed 
    the husband acknowledges while disputing both the duration and the extent of 
    the wife's active involvement. It is not even clear who had the idea of 
    embarking upon this trade. It is not surprising that recollections now 
    differ, 35 years or so after the event, and I for my part find it quite 
    impossible upon the evidence to reach any firm conclusion whether the wife's 
    activity ran from 1965 or from a year or so later, and whether it endured 
    until and possibly beyond 1973, or ended effectively in about 1968.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to suppose that, whatever the extent of her involvement, 
    the wife was other than conscientious and energetic. But I am quite unable 
    to ascribe to her involvement anything other than a minor role in the 
    overall development of these businesses, which clearly was engineered and 
    directed by the husband. Thus I would not be assisted, even if I could reach 
    firm conclusions, by the outcome of keenly contested issues, such as the 
    onset and initial extent of Jeffrey Cowan's involvement, the period at which 
    the husband's father was working for a builder and had some influence on the 
    developing trade, and the extent to which during this period the husband's 
    time was or was not taken up with his own business as a draughtsman. Nor am 
    I assisted by attempts to link the various stages in this development to the 
    reasonably firmly-fixed milestones which moves of home, office and business 
    premises provide.</P>
    <P>It is, in my view, quite simply unrealistic for the wife to say (as she 
    did in an affidavit sworn in February 1999) that during the early 1970s the 
    husband totally took over 'my executive responsibility'. Of course she may 
    have contributed ideas in the early stages, but the reality was that she 
    telephoned and canvassed orders, picked up and delivered goods, and managed 
    to combine that and no doubt a modest degree of bookkeeping with running the 
    home and caring for the children.</P>
    <P>The wife's case remains however that without the initial groundwork which 
    she did in this period there would have been no polythene business to 
    develop into what today exists. In a causal sense this may to a degree be 
    true. But the initial steps which she took, although by no means 
    insignificant, weigh light in the balance by contrast to the contribution 
    made by the husband's entrepreneurial flair and drive and his technical 
    knowledge and inventiveness.</P>
    <P>Thus I have no difficulty in concluding that the wife is not in the same 
    league as <I>Mrs Gojkovic </I>or<I> Lady Conran.</I>"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>He returned to this issue towards the end of his 
  judgment when he had regard to the matters enumerated in section 25(2) of the 
  matrimonial Causes Act 1973. He said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"A major feature of this case, and one to which I shall give 
    significant weight, is the length of the marriage. Another factor which 
    weighs heavily (although not with the weight for which the wife has 
    contended) is the balance of contributions which each of the spouses has 
    made over the effective duration of their marriage, thirty-five years until 
    separation six years ago.
    <P></P>
    <P>The husband's contribution is manifest. It can be measured crudely in the 
    assessment of resources which I have undertaken, and which puts a monetary 
    valuation upon his drive, vision and inventiveness. It is clearly the case 
    that his businesses have for many years absorbed his energies and his time. 
    He is clearly an exceptionally hard worker.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that the wife's contributions must be assessed. Of 
    course I take into account the extent (although I have found it to be modest 
    in the scope of the whole) to which she contributed to the germination of 
    the seed of these businesses before they really flourished and spread. But 
    that is just one ingredient in the contribution to the welfare of the family 
    which she made over all those years. For the necessary consequence of the 
    time and energy which the husband put towards his work is the extra burden 
    of responsibility which inevitably the wife would have to meet in bringing 
    up the children and organising the life of the family."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>On the second issue the judge's findings are to be 
  found in the following paragraphs of the judgment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"His evidence therefore totally failed to persuade me that the 
    position is as he represented it, either in relation to any firm 
    understanding or agreement between the brothers prior to the dismemberment 
    of the Jersey trust, nor as to any such agreement in any way binding upon 
    the husband at the time of the Inland Revenue negotiations or subsequently.
    <P></P>
    <P>In my judgement the husband has behaved, not as a man who has made a 
    perfected gift or entered into a contractual engagement, but more like a 
    trustee (or perhaps another appropriate word might be 'protector') of a 
    discretionary trust, of which Jeffrey Cowan (and indeed Graham Cowan) were 
    potential beneficiaries. I do not believe that he has been prepared in 
    relation to any of these companies to commit himself to parting with the 
    actual shares or their value. I believe that the same must go for the Baco 
    shares and for the loan notes. I believe that Mr Foreman was following his 
    instructions (and had no conflict of interest, as he did not act for either 
    Jeffrey Cowan or Graham Cowan) when he 'set up matters in Jersey such that 
    your options in respect of such matters are kept open until the last 
    moment'. That last moment had not arrived by the date of the hearing before 
    me.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Mr Foreman is an excellent exponent of the art of 
    the commercial lawyer, and that the husband has good reason to be grateful 
    for what was in effect the coup he achieved in the Inland Revenue 
    investigation. He is clearly fiercely loyal to his client but he made it 
    clear that that by no means meant that he was prepared to go to 
    extraordinary lengths to protect him from what he obviously regarded as 
    extravagant claims by the wife.</P>
    <P>He was asked how Jeffrey Cowan's position could be protected if, for 
    instance, the husband died. His response was that he alone constituted 
    Jeffrey Cowan's protection. It is all too easy to see how it might be 
    necessary to protect the husband's estate from the ruination of complex 
    litigation concerning the beneficial ownership of these shares. Having 
    regard to what for Mr Foreman is plainly normally his obvious and detailed 
    concern for clarity and certainty I am in those circumstances surprised that 
    so clear a position as he presents to me was never ever clearly documented. 
    The reason for that, it seems to me, is very unlikely to be any fault of Mr 
    Foreman. It may however reflect a lack of clarity, precision and finality in 
    the instructions he received from the husband. Just such a position as, 
    indeed, bundle Q in my judgment exemplifies. The way in which Mr Foreman 
    dealt with these matters is however consistent with the conclusion that the 
    shares were still in the husband's gift, rather than already given. And that 
    conclusion is consistent with the wife's understanding (which does not seem 
    to me to differ too much from the reality) that Jeffrey Cowan might get 
    something in the future.</P>
    <P>I therefore without any real doubt, having heard and seen the husband and 
    the witnesses he has relied upon on this topic, conclude that this aspect of 
    the case has been an attempt by the husband deliberately to maintain a 
    presentation for which he must be aware there is no firm foundation 
    whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The husband will be in a position to repay Jeffrey Cowan the £200,000 
    from his pension which was put towards the Revenue debt. The repayment of 
    that amount, whether as a matter of strict obligation or to repay a soft 
    loan, has been taken into account in Miss Baron's total figure. But I make 
    no allowance for the suggestion that the husband is under an obligation to 
    account to Jeffrey Cowan for 20% of loan note interest and any dividends 
    hitherto paid to the husband alone. That suggested liability owes more to a 
    realisation that it would be consistent with the underlying false 
    presentation than to any real obligation.</P>
    <P>In my judgment the current position in which Jeffrey Cowan finds himself 
    is very much that which has endured since the brothers joined their unequal 
    forces in business. He is a dependant of his more forceful and controlling 
    brother. As such I note in passing that in July 1998 by way of a combination 
    of pension provision and salary drawn from the businesses he and his wife 
    received remuneration at the gross rate of £106,000 per annum, as well as 
    benefits evaluated for tax purposes at £21,000 per annum."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    infrastructure and support in the context to which the husband is able to 
    work hard, prosper and accumulate his wealth. I can find no justification in

    Of course the value of the contribution, whether direct or indirect, is one 
    of the factors which are properly to be taken into account when applying 
    section 25 to the exercise of determining what the lump sum should be. In

  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Miss Baron, whose time for reply had been somewhat 
  invaded, took the precaution of handing in a written reply. What time remained 
  to her she devoted to undermining the submission that the husband had any 
  moral obligation to share the proceeds of the Baco sale with Jeffrey or to 
  issue him with shares in either Halcyon or Inca. She stressed that whatever 
  contribution Jeffrey had made was historic and more than matched by his 
  generous shareholding in Hanmere. He had additionally been provided with a 
  family home in the Canaries and was in receipt of a continuing six figure 
  annual income. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>A difficulty posed for this court at an early

  essentially prepared for a trial to determine the extent of the wife's 
  reasonable requirements. Had the judgment of the House of Lords been available 
  to the parties in October 1999 the later stages of preparation and the trial 
  itself would have concentrated on quite different issues. The most obvious 
  example of that proposition is that the wife would not have striven so hard to 
  prove her contribution as a business woman as opposed to as a wife and mother. 
  In the end her failure in that area led the judge to refuse her 10% of her 
  costs. Mr Pointer of course embraced that point and submitted that if we were 
  to set aside the order below justice demanded a retrial to enable his client 
  to adduce evidence on considerations brought into sharp focus by the ultimate 
  judgment in <I>White</I>. Equally Miss Baron, whilst contending that there was 
  no disadvantage to the husband in the chronology of events, herself submitted 
  that, if we were minded to allow any departure from equality, she too would 
  apply for a retrial before Singer J. </A>

  <P><B>The Context of <I>White v White</B></I></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>Before moving from that bald summary of skilful 
  submissions on both sides to any determination of outcome I intend first to 
  place the judgment of the House of Lords in the context of mounting pressure 
  for the reform of section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and then to 
  consider how courts of trial should adjust to the loss of a measure which, 
  although founded on an impermissible judicial construction of the statute, had 
  the merits of familiarity and practicality. For many specialists in this field 
  of litigation it is as though we have experienced the loss of an old but 
  useful tool. For the efficacy of the yardstick of reasonable requirements 
  developed by Ormrod LJ in the mid 1970s was much enhanced by this court's 
  subsequent approval of Mr Tim Lawrence's formula for the calculation of an 
  applicants' reasonable future spending requirements capitalised on the basis 
  of amortisation. The approval was given in November 1985 with the dismissal of 
  the appeal in <I>Duxbury v Duxbury.</I> (That the decision was not immediately 
  recognised as a landmark is illustrated by the fact that it was not reported 
  in the Family Law Reports until 1987 and not until 1992 in the Law Reports for 
  the Family Division.) The test of reasonable requirements, adopted primarily 
  for the determination of the wife's award in big money cases, has been viewed 
  and criticised as a judicial invention to depress the wife's share of the 
  available assets. The criticism seems to me not fully to understand the 
  elasticity of the concept. It was that elasticity that elevated Mrs White's 
  award in the Court of Appeal so significantly above her needs. Of course it 
  can equally be said that the same elasticity in Holman J's assessment of Mr 
  White's reasonable needs worked to depress Mrs White's award to a vulnerable 
  level. It is perhaps this extensification of the concept that has contributed 
  to its demise. Perhaps also it could be criticised for masking what was in 
  effect a judicial attempt to achieve the applicant's or the respondent's 
  deserts. But the statute nowhere speaks of deserts or entitlement as being 
  within the judicial objective. So to lodge deserts within the permissible 
  evaluation of respective needs was unjustifiable. But lodging it solely within 
  the permissible evaluation of respective contributions also seems to stretch 
  the bounds of that concept beyond what parliament intended. The evaluation of 
  deserts is at the core of the court's quest for a fair outcome. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 only consolidated 
  provisions brought into force on 1 January 1971 with the commencement of the 
  Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970. The original statutory 
  objective having proved quite impossible of practical attainment, it was 
  removed in 1984 without anything being substituted. In consequence in this 
  jurisdiction parliament placed great reliance upon the exercise of judicial 
  discretion, reasonably enough given the high calibre and acquired expertise of 
  the specialist judiciary. Nevertheless experience led to growing professional 
  disquiet at a number of cases in which the costs incurred equalled or exceeded 
  the sums in dispute. At the same time many academic commentators criticised 
  the absence of any predictability, let alone certainty, of outcome. Litigants 
  seeking advice from solicitors often received no better answer than that all 
  would depend on the judge before whom the case might be listed. If that was 
  the state of the law how were sensible litigants to plan for the future or to 
  settle their responsibilities by compromise? Although the Lord Chancellor's 
  Ancillary Relief Advisory Group addressed the problem of disproportionate 
  costs by advocating procedural reforms designed to put the court in control of 
  the litigation from its outset to its end, the more fundamental criticism

    would set out, in order of precedence, the aims or actions which the court

  judges have also sought to reflect changing social values or expectations. Of 
  course there are advantages in that the judges are available to gauge and 
  reflect social change whilst pressure on the legislative process makes it 
  unlikely that parliamentary reform will be attempted more than once in a 
  generation, at best. But after more than thirty years of judicial tinkering it 
  is evident to me that there is a pressing need for legislative review since 
  reforms to match social shifts since the late 1960s cannot be achieved by the

    small number of cases. I think this might be avoided by an exception for a 
    small tightly defined series of circumstances. On the whole, I think a 
    reasonably clear and definite set of rules will help to shorten the 
    discussion of ancillary relief once the issues are raised and, perhaps even 
    more important, enable people who are finding financial difficulties in

  between the parties', the writers continue: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This proposal was presumably intended to achieve greater 
    predictability in the determination of these cases. Whether it would promote 
    fairness, or generate a greater sense of satisfaction with the resulting 
    outcomes, is another question. In Scotland, where the 'five principles' are 
    enshrined in legislation, Professor Clive has argued that Scots law on 
    ancillary relief is at more or less the right point on the scale from 
    discretion to predictability. In England and Wales we do not at present have 
    an explicitly identified hierarchy of objectives, but it presumably would 
    not hurt were this to be provided, if only as an aid to public 
    understanding. It is not sufficient for experienced practitioners to 
    understand these things: the parties directly concerned need help in 
    penetrating the mysteries. Why should they not be told the basis upon which 
    the finances are meant to be decided? If we really are concerned to provide 
    the separating population with 'information' - and if we mean information, 
    not indoctrination - we might start with a plain man's account of the basis 
    upon which the court expects the financial cake to be apportioned. It is 
    about the most important piece of information people could have - the rest 
    is mainly preaching."

  <LI value=37><A name=para37>We also have a recent study by the National Centre 
  for Social Research, Settling Up (NSCR 2000) which shows that the sample of 
  separated couples interviewed supported the concept of equal division,

  reflect a range of factors most of which the existing statutory checklist 
  brings into focus. </A>

  <P><B>The Academic Appraisal</B></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>Next I turn to academic commentary on 
  <I>White</I>. First I would draw attention to the erudite picture presented by 
  Dr Stephen Cretney in the UCL series, Current Legal Problems 1999 (OUP 
  December 1999). Dr Cretney's theme in this publication of a lecture delivered 
  in February 1999 was that the judicial gloss developed for the practical 
  application of the statute survived critical scrutiny and rendered primary 
  legislation unnecessary. However two years on in his editorial comment on the 
  judgment in <I>White v White</I> in 2001 FLJ 3, Dr Cretney wrote: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Of course, it is true that talk of 'reasonable requirements' 
    can be made to sound absurd and indeed patronising. Yet it was this concept 
    which enabled the courts to give effective recognition to the principle that 
    in the typical case the marriage contract entitles spouses to the same level 
    of amenity as before the breakdown. It certainly does not follow that he or 
    she should be entitled to the division of capital assets which might have 
    been made had parliament in 1970 not specifically rejected the incorporation 
    of community of property into the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
    <P></P>
    <P>At a more fundamental level, is it far fetched to suggest that there is 
    something rather simplistic about the notion that home-making contributions 
    are to be equated in terms of economic value with commercially motivated 
    money-making activity? And even if right-thinking people now want to make 
    such an equation, is this not essentially a matter of social judgment for 
    decision by parliament rather than the courts?</P>
    <P>The present writer used to believe that, whilst the existing legislation 
    was in some respects imperfect - notably in not being sufficiently 
    comprehensible to the lay person - the cost and uncertainty inevitably 
    associated with the introduction of amending legislation outweighed any 
    likely benefit. That is no longer a view he feels able to 
  hold."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>Within the same issue of the Family Law Journal 
  there are other distinguished academic reviews from Professor Bailey-Harris 
  and John Eekelaar. Both appraisals share the theme that the effect of the 
  decision in <I>White v White</I> is more to declare what is unprincipled than 
  to provide principles to be applied in future cases. Professor Bailey-Harris' 
  view is encapsulated in this comment: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Those looking for firm or even straightforward judicial 
    guidelines for the exercise of discretion in ancillary relief will be 
    disappointed ...."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In a fuller review John Eekelaar summarises the effect of <I>White v 
  White</I> as moving 'the basis of the award firmly away from a subjective 
  evaluation of desert to a more objective assessment of entitlement'. However 
  he continues:</P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But despite the greater sense of certainty and consistency, 
    which this movement towards a more proprietal approach should achieve, and 
    which Lord Nicholls regards as important, there remain substantial 
    uncertainties. It is still the case that Lord Nicholls (as, given the 
    statutory words, he must) sees the basis for equality as resting on equal 
    contributions."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>In his conclusion he states '.... without some 
  statutory guidance we may be entering a very unsettled period'. Having 
  summarised the proposals in paragraph 4.49 of the white paper he concludes: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This may require some elaboration, but it is a reasonable 
    start. <I>White v White</I> can be seen as an important step along the road 
    to a general restructuring of this area of the law."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>Those whom I have cited in this section are 
  probably the three leading academic commentators in this field. I share their 
  common view that the declaration of the mechanism of reasonable requirements 
  as an impermissible aid to quantification leaves specialist practitioners and 
  judges facing a period of considerable uncertainty which this court has only a 
  limited power to resolve without contriving some alternative impermissible 
  mechanism. As Dr Cretney said in his 1999 lecture there is the 'constitutional 
  principle that it is for the legislature to decide on broad policy, and that 
  whilst there are many good reasons for leaving matters to a judicial 
  discretion the fact that the legislature cannot make up its mind is not one of 
  them'. Like Dr Cretney I believe that the case for statutory reform has been 
  much strengthened by the decision in <I>White v White</I> as well as by recent 
  research. Like John Eekelaar I see the decision in <I>White v White</I> as a 
  step on the road but very far from journey's end. Only parliament can take us 
  much further. John Eekelaar has often criticised the position which I 
  expressed in the case of <I>Atkinson v Atkinson</I> [1995] 2 FLR 356 when I 
  said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The function of the Family Division is not so much to state 
    principles as to reflect the relevant circumstances of the particular case 
    in the discretionary conclusion."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>That passage reflected my then attachment to the virtue of judicial 
  discretion, the ability to tailor a bespoke solution to the individual case. 
  But the trend in other jurisdictions from discretion towards predictability is 
  general, if not universal, and I am now convinced that there is an attainable 
  middle ground between the two extremes. However it is for parliament and not 
  for the judges to take us there, however uninviting the terrain may appear to 
  the government of the day. Of course there can certainly be no guarantee, and 
  some will say little likelihood, of statutory reform within the foreseeable 
  future. Therefore it will be necessary for this court, which is for many 
  reasons effectively the final court of appeal in this field, for the time 
  being to do what it can within legitimate limits by the practical application 
  of the principles to be found in <I>White v White</I> on a case by case 
  basis.</P>
  <P><B>The Principles in <I>White v White</B></I></P>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>In order to consider the practical application of 
  the guidance given by the House in <I>White</I> it is, of course, necessary to 
  look with care at the speech of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, with which the 
  other members of the court agreed. Lord Nicholls spoke of the principles to be 
  applied by trial judges saying, at 1573F: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It goes without saying that these principles should be 
    identified and spelt out as clearly as possible. This is important, so as to 
    promote consistency in court decisions and in order to assist parties and 
    their advisors and mediators in resolving disputes by agreement as quickly 
    and inexpensively as possible."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>I accept Mr Pointer's submission that the ratio of 
  the judgments in <I>White</I> is that the judge's objective is not equality 
  but fairness. In the opening paragraph of Lord Nicholls' speech he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Everyone would accept that the outcome on these matters, 
    whether by agreement or court order, should be fair. More realistically, the 
    outcome ought to be as fair as possible in all the circumstances. But 
    everyone's life is different. Features which are important when assessing 
    fairness differ in each case. And, sometimes, different minds can reach 
    different conclusions on what fairness requires. Then fairness, like beauty, 
    lies in the eye of the beholder. So what is the best method of seeking to 
    achieve a generally accepted standard of fairness?"
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>Then at the conclusion of his review of the 
  statutory provisions, at 1578B he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>".... The legislation does not state explicitly what is to be 
    the aim of the courts when exercising these wide powers. Implicitly, the 
    objective must be to achieve a fair outcome. The purpose of these powers is 
    to enable the court to make fair financial arrangements on or after divorce 
    in the absence of agreement between the spouses .... The powers must always 
    be exercised with this objective in view, giving first consideration to the 
    welfare of the children."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>The following section, headed 'Equality', is set 
  in the context of fairness. Having first observed that fairness requires the 
  court to take into account all the circumstances of the case and that there 
  will be great variety of circumstances to which the statutory provision 
  applies, he continued, at 1578D: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But there is one principle of universal application which can 
    be stated with confidence. In seeking to achieve a fair outcome, there is no 
    place for discrimination between husband and wife and their respective 
    roles."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>This is an important statement overruling 
  decisions of this court made in an earlier age that only allowed the wife's 
  claim to rise above the ceiling of reasonable requirements if she had been an 
  active participant in the family business or the husband's business 
  activities. Cases establishing that discriminatory state are exemplified by 
  <I>Trippas v Trippas</I> [1973] Fam 134 and <I>Page v Page</I> [1981] 2 FLR 
  198. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>Having in the following paragraph introduced the 
  yardstick of equality of division as a judicial tool Lord Nicholls states that 
  the use of the tool 'would help the parties and the court to focus on the need 
  to ensure the absence of discrimination'. However Lord Nicholls recognises 
  that whilst 'sometimes' the result will be 'a more or less equal division of 
  the available assets', 'more often' it will not: see 1578H </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>In the following section headed 'Financial 
  Resources and Financial Needs' Lord Nicholls demonstrates that the former 
  yardstick of reasonable requirements itself offends the principle by posing 
  the question at 1581H: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>".... Where the assets exceed the financial needs of both 
    parties, why should the surplus belong solely to the husband? On the facts 
    of a particular case there may be a good reason why the wife should be 
    confined to her needs and the husband left with the much larger balance. But 
    the mere absence of financial need cannot, by itself, be a sufficient 
    reason. If it were, discrimination would be creeping in by the back door. In 
    these cases, it should be remembered, the claimant is usually the wife. 
    Hence the importance of the check against the yardstick of equal division."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>He concludes this section by commending the courts 
  to return to the language of the statute and to apply the checklist in section 
  25(2) in deciding what would be a fair outcome. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>The theme of fairness returns again in the section 
  giving guidance as to the claims of the next generation. He said at 1583C: 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In my view, in a case where resources exceed needs, the correct 
    approach is as follows. The judge has regard to all the facts of the case 
    and to the overall requirements of fairness. When doing so, the judge is 
    entitled to have in mind the wish of a claimant wife that her award should 
    not be confined to living accommodation and a vanishing fund of capital 
    earmarked for living expenses which would leave nothing for her to pass on. 
    The judge will give to that factor whatever weight, be it much or little or 
    none at all, he considers appropriate in the circumstances of the particular 
    case."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=51><A name=para51>Likewise in the final section of general guidance 
  headed 'Inherited Money and Property', Lord Nicholls explains, at 1583F: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Property acquired before marriage and inherited property 
    acquired during marriage come from a source wholly external to the marriage. 
    In fairness, where this property still exists, the spouse to whom it was 
    given should be allowed to keep it."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Application of the Principles</B></P>
  <LI value=52><A name=para52>Thus it will be seen that the consistent theme is 
  the search for the goal of a fair outcome. But as Lord Nicholls emphasised 
  fairness is a subjective standard. An appeal for fairness is an appeal to the 
  heart as well as to the mind. Individual judges are likely to have widely 
  differing responses to the appeal. Insofar as there may be said to be 'a 
  generally accepted standard of fairness' how is the individual judge to 
  ascertain or perceive it? There can be no doubt that the specialist profession 
  is looking to this court to suggest ways and means of applying the principles 
  and guidance in Lord Nicholls speech to present and future cases during their 
  preparation or negotiation. What then can be said with confidence? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=53><A name=para53>The decision in <I>White v White</I> clearly does 
  not introduce a rule of equality. The yardstick of equality is a cross check 
  against discrimination. Fairness is the rule and in its pursuit the reasons 
  for departure from equality will inevitably prove to be too legion and too 
  varied to permit of listing or classification. They will range from the 
  substantial to the faint but that range can be reflected in the percentage of 
  departure. However it would seem to me undesirable for judges to be drawn into 
  too much specificity, ascribing precise percentage points to the various and 
  often counterbalancing reasons which the facts of individual cases render 
  relevant. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>Furthermore the decision in <I>White</I> is 
  directed to the abnormal case. In his introductory paragraph at 1573E, Lord 
  Nicholls said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This appeal raises questions about how the court should 
    exercise these powers in so-called 'big money' cases, where the assets 
    available exceed the parties financial needs for housing and income"
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>When recording the three features of the case he 
  said at 1575H: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The available assets substantially exceeded the amounts 
    required by Mr and Mrs White for their financial needs, in terms of a home 
    and income for each of them. The general observations I make later should be 
    read with this in mind."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>The present case is far more evidently a big money 
  case. It is common ground that the assets in contention are almost three times 
  the value of the assets of Mrs and Mrs White. Any consideration of the 
  application of the principles in <I>White</I> to the sort of case that is 
  decided daily by district judges up and down the country, and which may 
  therefore be loosely described as average or normal, will no doubt arise and 
  is better deferred to a case prepared and tried since October 2000. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>But even within the relatively narrow sphere of 
  the big money case the infinite variety of facts and circumstances thrown up 
  in individual cases makes it dangerous to generalise or to attempt to distil 
  principles. It is clearly safer to apply the decision in <I>White v White</I> 
  to the facts and circumstances of the present appeal. In so doing some 
  guidance will emerge for the negotiation or decision of cases broadly similar 
  on their facts or within which there is some clearly identifiable common 
  ingredient. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=para58>In summary therefore these seem to me to be the 
  consequences of the House of Lords recent review of the ancillary relief cases 
  in this court: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) Approved is the frequent theme of decisions in this court 
    that the trial judge must apply such criteria as are to be found in section 
    25.
    <P></P>
    <P>ii) Approved also is the almost inevitable judicial conclusion that the 
    unexpressed objective of the exercise is to arrive at a fair solution.</P>
    <P>iii) Disapproved is any discriminatory appraisal of the traditional role 
    of the woman as home-maker and of the man as bread-winner and arbiter of the 
    destination of family assets amongst the next generation. A calculation of 
    what would be the result of equal division is a necessary cross-check 
    against such discrimination.</P>
    <P>iv) Disapproved is any evaluation of outcome solely or even largely by 
    reference to reasonable requirements.</P>
    <P>v) Insofar as the yardstick of reasonable requirements was a judicially 
    created tool to enable negotiators and judges respectively to predict and 
    calculate conclusions it introduced an element of predictability and 
    accordingly curtailed the width of the judicial discretion conferred by 
    parliament. Thus the prohibition on the future use of the tool extends the 
    judicial discretion at the very moment when government policy has seemingly 
    moved in the reverse direction, in harmony with international trends, 
    academic and specialist commentaries and such research as is available. 
    Therein lies the heightened case for legislation. If that case was clear 
    when judges applied the yardstick of reasonable requirements measured in 
    part by Duxbury tables, it must be considerably clearer when the only 
    yardstick is a subjective judicial perception of fairness after a careful 
    appraisal of the section 25 criteria.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Present Appeal</B></P>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>How then do the <I>White v White</I> principles 
  apply to the present appeal? There is little indication of direct 
  discrimination in the judgment. Although rejecting the wife's claim to a 
  crucial role in the business success story, Singer J then directed himself by 
  adopting the approach of Purchas LJ in <I>Vicary v Vicary</I>, a decision that 
  is difficult to reconcile with the earlier decisions of <I>Trippas</I> and 
  <I>Page</I>. But in then limiting the wife to the ceiling of reasonable 
  requirements (as he was bound to do) he subjected the wife to some 
  discrimination by the back door, to borrow Lord Nicholls' phrase. This was an 
  example of the whole surplus above the reasonable requirements of both parties 
  going to one alone. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=60><A name=para60>So although there can be no possible criticism of 
  the judge, plainly his order cannot stand and the division of assets must be 
  re-addressed applying the criteria in section 25(2) as an aid to achieving an 
  outcome that is in accordance with current perceptions of fairness. But who is 
  to make this judgment? I would reject the submission that there should be a 
  retrial advanced by both parties, although on different grounds. I would do so 
  for a number of reasons. First the parties well knew that the judgment in 
  <I>White</I> was reserved before Singer J had reached his conclusions. It was 
  open to either party to invite him to reserve his decision until after the 
  House of Lords had ruled. After all that was the course adopted in the 
  contemporaneous appeal of <I>Dharamshi v Dharamshi</I> in which Mr Pointer 
  appeared for the appellant. Had that course been taken the parties would have 
  been spared the costs of this appeal and the suggestion that they should now 
  be exposed to a substantial tranche of costs beyond the costs in this court is 
  very unattractive. Nor in my opinion does justice to either party demand that 
  course. There is no evidence brought into relevance by the decision in 
  <I>White</I> that was not of relevance at the trial. Of course the emphases 
  have shifted but the effect of <I>White</I> has been to render irrelevant or 
  less relevant a number of issues that were prominent at the trial. That 
  conclusion can be checked by reference to the factors submitted by Mr Pointer 
  to direct a departure from equality when the time comes to carry out the cross 
  check, all of which are recorded in paragraph 21 above. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=61><A name=para61>Now on all these issues the judge heard abundant 
  evidence and made full findings. Nor does Miss Baron's submission that she 
  would want to adduce further evidence strike me as more than a tactical 
  response to Mr Pointer's application for retrial. It would surely be 
  essentially responsive to such further evidence as the husband might be 
  permitted to call. After all the wife's case on contributions and needs could 
  hardly have been more fully marshalled at the trial. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=62><A name=para62>Finally I am fortified in rejecting the submission 
  for a retrial by the thought that the evaluation of fairness according to 
  contemporary perceptions is better undertaken by three judges from three 
  different legal backgrounds than by one specialist. That is of course a luxury 
  of resources that could not possibly be afforded in any court of trial. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=63><A name=para63>Clearly our first task is to review the judge's 
  evaluation of the specific considerations itemised in section 25(2) and to 
  re-evaluate where necessary to reflect the guidance given by Lord Nicholls. 
  Then we must stand back and make our overall judgment of fairness on the 
  foundation of the judge's findings which either are not or cannot be 
  criticised at this stage of the appeal and applying the yardstick of equality 
  which in some, but not most, cases will indicate fairness. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=64><A name=para64>In the first exercise the principal areas of 
  re-evaluation must be needs and contribution. We discard the application of 
  the concept of reasonable requirements to establish a ceiling to the wife's 
  award. We discard the discriminatory bias introduced by this court in 
  <I>Trippas v Trippas</I>. We recognise the wife as well as the husband has a 
  legitimate aspiration to devise a substantial estate at the end of her life. 
  None of these judicially created factors may be used to depress the wife's 
  award. Of course it is the first factor that worked against the wife at trial. 
  There is good indication that in preferring the authority of <I>Vicary v 
  Vicary</I> the judge circumvented the second, at least in part. The third 
  factor is not directly referred to but may have operated against the wife by 
  common acceptance. Clearly once these factors are discarded the way is open to 
  a substantial increase in the wife's award. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=65><A name=para65>But there are counter-balancing factors. The wife 
  has retained the former matrimonial home, fully equipped, and has already 
  secured her second home. Her housing arrangements were seen by the judge to be 
  complete and likely to continue unchanged for the foreseeable future, if not 
  for her life. The amount of family money invested to achieve this position 
  amounted to about £1.35M. By contrast the husband's readjustment was perhaps 
  only partially complete. He had moved from a rented flat to a heavily 
  mortgaged flat. The amount of family money invested in meeting his housing 
  needs was only about £150K. But why should his allowance be any less than that 
  of the wife? To bring about parity or, put another way, to allow him to 
  complete a comparable re-adjustment an additional £1.2M would have to be 
  transferred from liquid funds to bricks and mortar. What the husband 
  ultimately chooses is a matter for him but it is not unreasonable for him to 
  have the opportunity to acquire comparable primary and secondary homes. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=66><A name=para66>Second where, as here, the final hearing happens 
  to take place at a time when the trader or manufacturer has recently sold up, 
  the liquidation should not necessarily be regarded as irreversible. There may 
  need to be some recognition of the trader's right to elect whether to stop 
  there or whether to re-invest in a fresh vehicle for his commercial creativity 
  and industry. The need to work and the freedom to work may be as important to 
  an individual as the need to make a home and the freedom to choose it. Of 
  course the simultaneous occurrence of realisation and judgment may spare the 
  judge the need to consider liquidity considerations. But that will not be so 
  in the more general case where the family has a considerable wealth on paper 
  but where the bulk of the assets are tied up in a private company upon which 
  the standard of living of all family members depend and which represents one 
  party's life work. The future resolution of liquidity problems must surely be 
  equally governed by considerations of fairness. So in this case it seems to me 
  fair to recognise the husband's continuing need to exercise his business 
  talents. By contrast the wife has had no business involvement for about 25 
  years. The husband has not yet completed the implementation of the Baco deal. 
  Admittedly he retains his shares in Hanmere, Inca and Halcyon. But the last is 
  essentially under Graham's management and Inca offers scant opportunity for 
  management. It may be that the husband would be content to rest on his laurels 
  but that should be a matter of choice rather than an inevitable outcome of the 
  case. After all had the wife brought her claim to trial shortly after the 
  final separation the majority of the family's assets would have been tied up 
  in the private companies and in assessing the wife's entitlement the judge 
  would have had to have regard to what cash could be withdrawn from the trading 
  companies without jeopardising their continuing trade. For those reasons it 
  would in my opinion be fair to give some priority to a choice for the husband 
  either to finance a future business venture alternatively to invest in the 
  development or extension of the two trading companies that he presently owns 
  or controls. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=67><A name=para67>Third in my opinion fairness certainly permits and 
  in some cases requires recognition of the product of the genius with which one 
  only of the spouses may be endowed. Indeed Miss Baron conceded the 
  proposition, whilst contending that this husband was not in the category, 
  since she submitted that he was no more than a hard working businessman. That 
  submission does not seem to me to do justice to the husband's achievements, 
  which clearly for their scale depended upon his innovative visions as well as 
  upon his ability to develop those visions. It is a factor that in the present 
  case deserves some recognition. I do not regard it as discrimination by the 
  back door. Whilst no doubt the husband's capacity to devote himself to the 
  expansion of the companies depended in part upon the stability and security of 
  the home and family life which the wife created and sustained, his creativity 
  was not so dependant to the same or perhaps to any degree. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=68><A name=para68>Fourth I do not consider that the husband's 
  considerable failure to prove his case that Jeffrey was a substantial 
  shareholder in HD Plastics and the other companies is as conclusive as Miss 
  Baron submits. That case involved discovery of countless documents and days of 
  evidence. All it revealed was a familiar picture of inconsistency and 
  contradiction that usually emerges when an individual, and still more when a 
  family, engages in wholesale tax evasion on a grand scale over an extended 
  period. The husband had to bear the costs of his unsurprising failure to prove 
  that Jeffrey was the owner of shares in law or equity. But I see no reason to 
  hold that beyond that price he should be debarred from now advancing a lesser 
  and more realistic case. The judge found the husband to be not a trustee for 
  his brothers in the legal sense but more as a protector. I take that to mean 
  little more than that there may be some expectation on the part of Jeffrey and 
  Graham to share to some degree in the cargo, now that the husband's ship has 
  come in. That may or may not create a corresponding inclination to share, 
  depending on the dynamics of the family. But there is much evidence of the 
  past collaboration of the band of brothers and loyalty and interdependence 
  amongst brothers is to be respected, provided it does not diminish the 
  cohesion of the families to which they individually belong. Another way of 
  judging this somewhat elusive aspect of the case is to say that, even if the 
  younger brothers are sufficiently provided to meet their current wants, I am 
  in no doubt that if some significant misfortune overtook either Jeffrey, 
  Graham or a member of their individual families, then there would be a shared 
  understanding that the husband would alleviate the crisis as far as money 
  allowed. He has always had the role of patriarch or head of the family and 
  part of the power of such a figure is to be generous in adversity. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=para69>Fifth the special characteristics of the pension 
  funds held by the husband and the wife respectively require recognition. The 
  husband's fund is all vested and is no more and no less than a whole life 
  fixed rate income stream. The fact that it would costs £1.19M to purchase an 
  identical income stream allows a capitalisation for comparative purposes. But 
  it is not truly comparable with a cash fund of £1.19M for the obvious reason 
  that the latter is replete with options as to deployment, investment, and 
  spending, as well as having the capacity to survive intact the owner's demise. 
  There is also the disparity between the values notionally ascribed to their 
  respective pension funds. The husband's investment in this sphere put at 
  £1.19M is nearly five time the wife's investment of £245,000. Furthermore 
  before the wife's vested pension fund is set at that level she will have 
  drawn, or had the opportunity to draw, an additional sum of about £45,000 in 
  cash. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=70><A name=para70>All the above considerations are capable of 
  inclusion in a review of the respective needs, responsibilities and/or 
  contributions of the parties. They cover three of Mr Pointer's four 
  submissions summarised in paragraph 21 above. The third, namely that much of 
  the husband's fortune was generated in the six years post separation, receives 
  no reflection because in my opinion it is inherently fallacious. The 
  assessment of assets must be at the date of trial or appeal. The language of 
  the statute requires that. Exceptions to that rule are rare and probably 
  confined to cases where one party has deliberately or recklessly wasted assets 
  in anticipation of trial. In this case the reality is that the husband traded 
  his wife's unascertained share as well as his own between separation and 
  trial, particularly committing those undivided shares to the investment in 
  Baco. The wife's share went on risk and she is plainly entitled to what in the 
  event has proved to be a substantial profit. If this factor has any relevance 
  it is within the evaluation of the husband's exceptional contribution. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=71><A name=para71>Another submission that can be disposed of as 
  summarily is Miss Baron's reliance on Protocol 7. To begin with statements of 
  intention to legislate are of little immediate relevance. Second even were the 
  Protocol ratified it would have no bearing upon the division of assets on 
  divorce. It is to property rights and not to statutory claims in the exercise 
  of a judicial discretion that the Protocol relates. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=72><A name=para72>Where do those conclusions lead me? Standing back, 
  as it were standing on the hilltop to appraise the resulting view from the 
  foreground to the horizon, I am in no doubt that the wife must have more and 
  substantially more than the present judgment gives her. She first sought an 
  additional £2.7M. She increased the target of her appeal by amendment to 
  £4.6M. In my judgment the first target was completely unachievable at the date 
  it was declared and the second only partially achievable in the light of the 
  decision in <I>White</I>. I am of the opinion that this court should increase 
  the wife's worth from about £3.2M to about £4.4M by increasing the lump sum 
  from £1.775M to £3M. Since the sum total of the available assets is about 
  £11.5M that represents an overall division of about 38% to the wife and 62% to 
  the husband who will be left with a worth of about £7.1M after complying with 
  our order. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=73><A name=para73>I would therefore allow the appeal and substitute 
  that greater sum for the sum ordered in the court below. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>LORD JUSTICE ROBERT WALKER: </B></P>
  <LI value=74><A name=para74>I have had the great advantage of reading in draft 
  the judgment of Thorpe LJ and I gratefully adopt his summary of the facts. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=75><A name=para75>In this appeal we have to consider the effect of 
  the House of Lords' decision in <I>White v White</I> <A 
  href="../../../../../uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2000] 3 WLR 1571</a></A>. 
  That decision is plainly very important, not least in its recognition of the 
  need for clearly-stated principles for the guidance of advisers and mediators 
  (as well as judges): see the speeches of Lord Nicholls and Lord Cooke at 
  pp.1573 F and 1588 C respectively. But I cannot see the House of Lords' 
  decision as some sort of cataclysm which has put a quarter of a century's 
  family jurisprudence into antediluvian obsolescence. Since the House of Lords 
  dismissed both the husband's appeal and the wife's cross-appeal from the 
  decision of this court (Butler-Sloss, Thorpe and Mantell LJ, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1046.html">[1999] Fam 304</a>, 
  [1998] 4 AER 659) it would be very surprising if that were its effect. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=76><A name=para76>It is worth reflecting on the facts of <I>White v 
  White</I>. Both parties were from farming families. They were both described 
  as farmers on their marriage certificate when they married in 1961, and within 
  a year of marriage they bought a farm of 120 acres with a fine Jacobean 
  farmhouse for £32,000, most of it raised on mortgage or provided (in the form 
  of a long-term interest-free loan approximating to a gift) by the husband's 
  father. The husband and wife themselves contributed more or less equally to 
  the initial capital of the farming partnership which they conducted for over 
  30 years (and which continued even after separation had put an end to their 
  marital partnership). The partnership business was (as Thorpe LJ said in this 
  court, [1999] Fam at p.312F [1998] 4 AER at p.644j) the dominant feature of 
  the case. Over the years the partnership acquired a further 178 acres or so of 
  land, and in 1996 the farm (with its live and dead stock, equipment and milk 
  quota) was worth about £3.5m (this excludes the smaller farm which, although 
  farmed by the partnership, was not a partnership asset). If the case is to be 
  regarded as a "big-money" case at all, it is not because of any outstanding 
  inventiveness or entrepreneurial skill on the part of either husband or wife, 
  but because of their unspectacular hard work and prudence over a long period 
  which saw large increases in the values of country houses and farms. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=77><A name=para77>On these facts the first-instance decision in 
  <I>White v White</I> (to award the wife £800,000 or little over one-fifth of 
  the total assets) can be seen as obviously, indeed almost grotesquely, unfair. 
  (In justice to the judge it must be said that the outcome seems to have been 
  heavily influenced by the way the wife's case was put forward by her legal 
  advisers, who had changed by the time the case came to this court.) </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=78><A name=para78>The unfairness of the outcome is underlined by the 
  fact that the judge's decision to award nearly four-fifths of the assets to 
  the husband was (see [1999] Fam at p.311A-C, [1998] 4 AER at p.663d-e) set out 
  in a single paragraph entitled '<I>Husband's</I> reasonable requirements' 
  (emphasis supplied). The husband could "reasonably require to be able to 
  continue farming in a worthwhile way" but a similar aspiration on the part of 
  the wife was adjudged "unwise, and not justifiable". <I>Her</I> reasonable 
  requirements were to be satisfied on <I>Duxbury</I> lines (see <I>Duxbury v 
  Duxbury</I> (1985) [1992] Fam 62, [1990] 2 AER 77). That was an unfair 
  discrimination between husband and wife, and this court recognised it as such. 
  Thorpe LJ said ([1999] Fam at p.317B, [1998] 4 AER at p.669a): </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In my opinion there is no fairness in such an outcome. Indeed 
    it offends my sense of fairness that a wife who has worked for over 30 years 
    equally and not nominally in partnership should exit with anything less than 
    her legal entitlement in the absence of extraordinary features."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Butler-Sloss LJ said ([1999] Fam at p.321D, [1998] 4 AER at p.673a-c):</P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"[The judge] gave no reasons for reducing her entitlement from 
    £1.5m to approximately £1m when it was manifest, and the judge said as much, 
    that the £500,000 which he transferred from the wife to the husband was in 
    excess of the husband's reasonable requirements. It seems clear that 
    omission was as a result of his concentration upon the wife's reasonable 
    requirements starting again from the basic figures, <I>Duxbury</I> fashion, 
    and thus overlooking her entitlement to the greater sum as the starting 
    point. In that he erred in principle. But I have considerable sympathy with 
    him, since counsel, then appearing for the wife, argued the case first on 
    contribution and not principally on entitlement and, as an alternative 
    argument, took the judge along the <I>Duxbury</I> route."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=79><A name=para79>In these circumstances there was to my mind 
  nothing particularly startling or revolutionary in the speech of Lord Nicholls 
  (with which the other members of the House of Lords agreed, Lord Cooke adding 
  some observations about the development of the law in Australia and New 
  Zealand). Lord Nicholls made very clear ([2000] 3 WLR at p.1579 A-F) that he 
  was not introducing a disguised presumption of equal division and that any 
  such presumption would be a matter for Parliament. He described <I>Duxbury</I> 
  (at p.1582 E) as a useful guide to assessing the capital cost of an income 
  requirement, but nothing more. He traced (at pp.1580 A - 1581 D) the history 
  of the judicially-developed concept of 'reasonable requirements' from its 
  origins in the judgment of Ormrod LJ in <I>O'D v O'D</I> [1976] Fam 83, 91, 
  noting the different views as to its general usefulness expressed in <I>Dart v

  <P></P>
  <LI value=80><A name=para80>Then came (at p.1581 G-H) an important passage in 
  Lord Nicholls' speech, on which both sides relied: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The statutory provisions lend no support to the idea that a 
    claimant's financial needs, even interpreted generously and called 
    reasonable requirements, are to be regarded as determinative. Another factor 
    to which the court is bidden to have particular regard is the available 
    resources of each party. As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, 
    observed in <I>Piglowska v Piglowski</I> <A 
    href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/27.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/27.html">[1999] 1 WLR 1360</a></A>, 1379, section 25(2) does not rank the matters listed in that 
    subsection in any kind of hierarchy. The weight, or importance, to be 
    attached to these matters depends upon the facts of the particular case. But 
    I can see nothing, either in the statutory provisions or in the underlying 
    objective of securing fair financial arrangements, to lead me to suppose 
    that the available assets of the respondent become immaterial once the 
    claimant wife's financial needs are satisfied. Why ever should they? If a 
    husband and wife by their joint efforts over many years, his directly in his 
    business and hers indirectly at home, have built up a valuable business from 
    scratch, why should the claimant wife be confined to the court's assessment 
    of her reasonable requirements, and the husband left with a much larger 
    share? Or, to put the question differently, in such a case, where the assets 
    exceed the financial needs of both parties, why should the surplus belong 
    solely to the husband? On the facts of a particular case there may be a good 
    reason why the wife should be confined to her needs and the husband left 
    with the much larger balance. But the mere absence of financial need cannot, 
    by itself, be sufficient reason. If it were, discrimination would be 
    creeping in by the back door. In these cases, it should be remembered, the 
    claimant is usually the wife. Hence the importance of the check against the 
    yardstick of equal division."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=81><A name=para81>Lord Nicholls emphasised the importance of that 
  check by referring to it three times (see also p.1578 H and p.1579 H). He went 
  on to suggest that it might be better to return to the language of the statute 
  (section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 as substituted by section 3 of 
  the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984) and to stop using the 
  troublesome expression 'reasonable requirements'. He said (at p.1582 B-C): 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But the end product of this assessment of financial needs 
    should be seen, and treated by the court, for what it is: only one of the 
    several factors to which the court is to have particular regard. This is so, 
    whether the end product is labelled financial needs or reasonable 
    requirements. In deciding what would be a fair outcome the court must also 
    have regard to other factors such as the available resources and the 
    parties' contributions. In following this approach the court will be doing 
    no more than giving effect to the statutory scheme."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=82><A name=para82>In citing these passages Miss Florence Baron QC 
  (appearing with Mr Simon Gill for Mrs Jacqueline Cowan) relied on Lord 
  Nicholls' emphatic statement that financial needs (or reasonable requirements) 
  are only one of several factors, including available resources and the 
  parties' contributions to the welfare of the family. Mr Martin Pointer QC 
  (appearing with Mr Valentine Le Grice for Mr Michael Cowan) relied on the "If" 
  at the beginning of Lord Nicholls' second rhetorical question, and on his 
  observation that, on the facts of a particular case, there may be good reasons 
  for confining a wife's provision to her needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Financial Needs (or Reasonable Requirements)</B></P>
  <LI value=83><A name=para83>The facts of the present case vividly illustrate 
  some of the difficulties inherent in all three of the important variables 
  singled out by Lord Nicholls: financial needs, contributions to welfare, and 
  available resources. At or near the poverty line, financial needs (so far as 
  not met by income support or housing benefit) are basic and capable of 
  reasonably accurate quantification: rent, services, food, clothing, travel to 
  work, and so on. Towards the other end of the spectrum, a sort of variant of 
  Parkinson's Law seems to set in, by which needs (or requirements) expand to 
  fill the available resources. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=84><A name=para84>I would find it rather incongruous, and I dare say 
  that Mrs Cowan herself (who knows what it is like to bring up two small 
  children in a council house on a very small income) would also find it 
  incongruous, to describe as needs some of the items listed in her schedule of 
  expenditure exhibited to an affidavit sworn on 17 June 1998: nearly £10,000 a 
  year on clothes, footwear and jewellery, over £3,000 a year on pets' food and 
  the farrier, and over £36,000 a year on personal care, sports, entertainment 
  and holidays. In fairness to Mrs Cowan she did not in her affidavit describe 
  all these expenses as necessities, and she said that she had not been able to 
  enjoy some of these things since her separation. But this evidence formed the 
  basis of Miss Baron's submission that the judge's assessment of her needs at 
  £100,000 a year (after tax) was far too low. To my mind a separated wife 
  should not have to persuade the court that she has become incurably addicted 
  to a lavish lifestyle in order to obtain a fair share of the matrimonial 
  assets. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=85><A name=para85>The concept of reasonable requirements is (as 
  Thorpe LJ said in <I>Dart v Dart</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/1343.html">[1996] 2 FLR 286</a>, 296) an elastic one. 
  Enquiry as to whether any particular set of requirements is reasonable 
  inevitably brings other matters into play. One approach (as Wilson J noted in 
  <I>Conran v Conran</I> [1997] 2 FLR at p.623 D) is </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>" ... to allow for her contribution, as well as all the other 
    relevant factors, in determining the reasonableness of her requirements. In 
    other words her contribution will make it reasonable for her to have greater 
    requirements. "
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=86><A name=para86>But Wilson J felt that in a really 'big money' 
  case that approach did violence to language, and was not consistent with 
  section 25(2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. I respectfully agree with 
  that. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Contributions to Family Welfare</B></P>
  <LI value=87><A name=para87>The facts also illustrate the difficulty of 
  assessing contributions which are largely of a different character and are 
  therefore inherently incommensurable. Wilson J in <I>Conran v Conran</I> 1997 
  2 FLR 615, 625 described the task as being sometimes "a profoundly difficult 
  exercise, which can be undertaken only in the most general way". In that case 
  Wilson J was concerned with a husband who had made a huge fortune by his 
  talents, and an equally talented wife who had made a significant contribution 
  to the husband's success (but, as Wilson J added at p.628, "it would be absurd 
  to conclude that the wife played anything approaching an equal role with the 
  husband in the actual generation of his wealth"). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=88><A name=para88>The case of <I>Gojkovic v Gojkovic</I> [1990] 1 
  FLR 140 was a case in which the contributions of husband and wife were held to 
  have been equal (arguably the wife's had been greater). They had come to this 
  country in 1966 without any savings and had built up a successful hotel 
  business by hard work and sacrifice during nine years' cohabitation and a 
  further nine years' childless marriage. To my mind the only surprising feature 
  of the case is that it was the husband and not the wife who appealed against 
  an order awarding her a lump sum of £1m out of available assets worth £4m. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=89><A name=para89><I>White v White</I> was not as clear-cut as 
  <I>Gojkovic v Gojkovic</I>: the husband and wife received valuable assistance 
  from his side of the family, and the wife had three children, caring for whom 
  must at times have restricted her direct contribution to the farming 
  partnership. But she also worked hard on the farm. The case resembled 
  <I>Gojkovic v Gojkovic</I> in that the marriage had got into the 'big money' 
  league through years of hard work and prudent management rather than through 
  wholly exceptionally entrepreneurial or inventive talent. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=90><A name=para90>The court looks at authorities primarily for 
  principles, not in order to engage in any detailed comparisons between the 
  facts of different cases. Nevertheless in this area of family law some 
  reference to the facts of decided cases is necessary in order to breathe life 
  into the generality of principles. The judge (see paras. 52 and 53 of his 
  judgment) said that he had no difficulty in concluding that Mrs Cowan was not 
  in the same league as Mrs Gojkovic or Lady Conran. He did not indicate what 
  league he would put Mr Cowan in, but he did refer to his "entrepreneurial 
  flair and drive and his technical knowledge and inventiveness". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=91><A name=para91>Both sides suggested in argument that if this case 
  had been tried after the House of Lords had given judgment in <I>White v 
  White</I>, the evidence as well as the submissions would have been very 
  different. That may be so, but if so I find it rather surprising. 
  <I>Gojkovic</I>, <I>Conran</I> and <I>White</I> (in this court) had all been 
  heard and reported well before the trial; issues of exceptional contributions 
  had been debated; and Miss Baron made clear at trial that she was seeking an 
  equal division (see para 148 of the judgment). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=92><A name=para92>On the evidence which he did have, the judge made 
  some reasonably clear findings. I have already referred to what he said about 
  the husband's talents. He said that the wife's direct contribution was not 
  insignificant, but that it weighed light in the balance. He was unable to make 
  any definite findings about the duration of the period (probably spanning 
  1970) during which the wife was actively involved in starting up the polythene 
  business (on the dates which were bandied about in evidence this period could 
  have been as short as one year or as long as eight, but the weight of the 
  evidence tended towards the longer end of the bracket). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=93><A name=para93>There is no ground on which this court could 
  interfere with the findings of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses. But 
  having studied passages of the witness statements and transcripts I think it 
  is possible that the judge did, paradoxically, tend to undervalue the 
  contributions made by both parties to the marriage (any such errors would 
  cancel each other, except so far as they pushed the case further into the 
  exceptional range). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=94><A name=para94>Mr Cowan was not merely a successful businessman 
  but an exceptionally active, determined and innovative businessman. (It has to 
  be said that he was also rather an unscrupulous businessman, so far as paying 
  taxes was concerned.) In his evidence in chief he gave a vivid account, not 
  challenged in cross-examination, of how the business grew from being mere 
  merchants of polythene to being manufacturers, first of ordinary polythene and 
  then of high density polythene, with the constant need to investigate new 
  sources of raw materials, manufacturing plant and technical processes. The 
  manufacturing started in an old mill at Watton-at-Stone, then moved to 
  Letchworth, and then to the present factory at Biggleswade. The business 
  suffered various vicissitudes including the simultaneous departure of several 
  key staff in the mid-1980's. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=95><A name=para95>Mrs Cowan was on any view directly involved in the 
  business only in its infancy, when she drummed up custom by cold-calling 
  builders (who were beginning to use polythene sheeting for damp-proofing) and 
  delivered orders by car with one or both of her young sons, and the dog, in 
  the back. She too worked very hard and showed courage and determination in a 
  fairly tough man's world. Mr Cowan himself readily acknowledged that in the 
  very early days the business was carried on largely by his wife, based at 
  home. If it is the first step that counts, Mrs Cowan does seem to have played 
  an important part in Mr Cowan's transition from being a wage-earner to having 
  his own business. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=96><A name=para96>The judge may also, I think, have paid 
  insufficient attention to Mrs Cowan's evidence that she became, in effect, a 
  clerk of works after her husband bought Hadham Grange in 1976. One of the many 
  remarkable features of this case is that (despite the no doubt insatiable 
  demands of the business for further capital investment) Mr and Mrs Cowan 
  managed to move from a council house in Stevenage (where they lived until 
  1963) by way of two modest owner-occupied properties, to the purchase in 1976 
  of Hadham Grange, a property now valued (in a greatly improved state) at more 
  than £1m. That is another indication of their ambition and energy. Even so, 
  the purchase in 1976 was possible only because Hadham Grange was in a very 
  dilapidated state, and Mrs Cowan undertook a lot of practical responsibility

  also bringing up their two sons, who started their formal education at a local 
  primary school and ended it at a fee-paying boarding school in Cambridge. </A>

  <LI value=97><A name=para97>In his judgment (which was reserved for over four 
  months) the judge made some reasonably clear findings of fact, to which I have 
  already referred, about the parties' respective contributions. I do not think 
  he can be criticised for being unable to make clearer findings about events 
  which occurred 30 years or more ago, and which were not covered by documentary 
  evidence. He then referred to <I>Conran v Conran</I> and to <I>Vicary v

  <P></P>
  <LI value=98><A name=para98>That passage is fully in line with Lord Nicholls' 
  speech in <I>White v White</I>, especially the passage (at p.1581 E-H) quoted 
  in paragraph 6 above. The most serious criticism of the judgment under appeal 
  (and in my view an unanswerable one) is that after the judge's careful review 
  of the parties' respective contributions, he moved abruptly (in para 151 of 
  his judgment) to reaching his conclusion on an assessment of Mrs Cowan's 
  reasonable requirements. But before discussing that further I should say 
  something about the third important variable, available resources. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Available Resources</B></P>
  <LI value=99><A name=para99>Given the complex nature of Mr Cowan's financial 
  affairs and the acrimony which has unfortunately attended this litigation, the 
  parties and their advisers deserve some credit for managing, at least by the 
  second day of the appeal hearing, to reach a large measure of agreement as to 
  the identity and approximate value of the assets which are available for 
  division. One of the last important steps in the process was this court's 
  decision not to entertain a late respondent's notice asserting that Mr Cowan's 
  brother Jeffrey has an enforceable equitable interest (and not merely possible 
  moral claims, to which I return below) in one-fifth of Mr Cowan's 
  shareholdings in his private companies. Another important step was the 
  parties' agreement on reasonably definite figures (although not absolutely 
  final figures) for what Mr Cowan will receive, after capital gains tax, from 
  the sale of his 1980 B shares in Baco Consumer Products Ltd ("Baco") and the 
  early redemption of his £4.4m 5% Baco loan stock 2005-9. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>In these circumstances the judge's conclusions as to the available 
  resources, and their allocation between the parties, can be set out in a 
  simplified form which is still close to the figures agreed on the last day of 
  the hearing:</P>

  <LI value=100><A name=order100>However unfairly Mrs Cowan may feel that she 
  has been treated, it is apparent that two events since 1992 (when Mrs Cowan 
  first issued, but did not serve, her divorce petition) have operated in her 
  favour. One is the settlement (following an offer letter dated 3 December 
  1996) of Mr Cowan's investigation by the Special Compliance Office of the 
  Inland Revenue; the other is the disposal, since the first-instance judgment 
  was delivered, of Mr Cowan's Baco B shares and loan notes for a total 
  consideration estimated (net of capital gains tax) at £6.794m. These two 
  events mean that the husband's assets are much more readily defined, and are 
  much more liquid, than would otherwise have been the case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=101><A name=order101>Mr Pointer correctly submitted that the capital 
  value attributed to Mr Cowan's pension rights is not a freely disposable 
  asset, and must be enjoyed in the form of a taxable annuity (Mr Cowan has 
  already drawn down the permitted lump sum in order to help fund his settlement 
  with the Inland Revenue). The judge seems to have had that point well in mind 
  (paras 27 and 134) in considering Mr Cowan's capital and income resources. The 
  figure of £1.19m mentioned as the notional capital value of the pension rights 
  is based on the cost of a purchased life annuity (which receives more 
  favourable treatment for income tax purposes) and is less than the actual cost 
  of an annuity acquired by an exempt approved pension scheme. This is not a 
  case in which Mr Cowan will be restricted to a single immutable source of 
  income. He will have a large fund of free capital to invest as he chooses. He 
  will also control the three private companies which remain unsold (Hanmore, 
  Halcyon and Inca) and will be able, in conjunction with his brothers, to 
  decide whether these investments should be disposed of or retained. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=102><A name=order102>The judge devoted a good deal of his judgment 
  to a review of the evidence as to whether Mr Cowan held part of his holdings 
  in trust for his brother Jeffrey. The judge reached the clear conclusion, on 
  ample grounds, that that had not been established (para 88): </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"[Mr Cowan's] evidence therefore totally failed to persuade me 
    that the position is as he represented it, either in relation to any firm 
    understanding or agreement between the brothers prior to the dismemberment 
    of the Jersey Trust, nor as to any such agreement in any way binding upon 
    [Mr Cowan] at the time of the Inland Revenue negotiations or subsequently."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=103><A name=order103>Mr Pointer relied heavily on the following 
  paragraph of the judgment to suggest that the judge found that Mr Cowan was in 
  the position of a trustee of a discretionary trust. But that paragraph must be 
  read in context. Its thrust was to say that Jeffrey did not have a beneficial 
  interest, not to deny that Mr Michael Cowan did have such an interest. His 
  only discretion was whether or not to give away his own property. As 
  Hutchinson J said in <I>El Awadi v Bank of Credit</I> [1990] 1 QB 606, 617, 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>" ...it makes no sense to talk of a discretion that is entirely 
    divorced from any kind of obligation or duty in regard to which the 
    discretion is exerciseable. For me to stipulate that I have an absolutely 
    unfettered discretion whether to make good the loss of a £5 note which is 
    blown into the Thames from the hand of an old lady queuing for a bus in 
    front of me is a true but pointless assertion."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=104><A name=order104>In my view the judge was clearly right on this 
  point, and we refused permission for a late respondent's notice challenging 
  his conclusion. That is not to say that Mr Cowan did not and does not have a 
  genuine wish and intention to act generously towards his brothers, and 
  especially towards Jeffrey (Mrs Cowan has at all times accepted that Mr 
  Michael Cowan's other brother Graham does have an enforceable beneficial 
  interest in part of the Halcyon shares). I would not accept Miss Baron's 
  submission that Mr Cowan's failure to establish that Jeffrey has an 
  enforceable interest excludes any possibility of a moral claim. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=105><A name=order105>Nevertheless I would attach very little weight 
  to Jeffrey's moral claim. All the evidence (including Jeffrey's own very 
  candid evidence) suggests that Jeffrey made only a small contribution to the 
  outstanding success of Mr Michael Cowan's businesses, and that Jeffrey has 
  already been rewarded on a very generous scale. If Mr Cowan wishes to give his 
  brother more, that is a matter for him. But someone in his position must be 
  just before he is generous. Any further provision which Mr Cowan wishes to 
  make for his brother Jeffrey must come out of his own share of the matrimonial 
  assets, and cannot be a reason for diminishing his wife's share. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Conclusion</B></P>
  <LI value=106><A name=order106>This case is unusual and of some general 
  importance, in that it requires this court to apply the principles derived 
  from the House of Lords' decision in <I>White v White</I> in circumstances 
  where there was much less equality of proprietary entitlement as between 
  husband and wife, and where his contribution (in terms of entrepreneurial 
  flair, inventiveness and hard work) was truly exceptional. I have therefore 
  thought it right to set out my own views on some of the special features of 
  this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=107><A name=order107>Nevertheless I am in general agreement with the 
  more profound analysis of the issues in the judgment of Thorpe LJ, and with 
  his observations on the part which Parliament has to play in the development 
  of this area of the law. Like Thorpe LJ, I think that the judge erred in 
  placing too much weight on 'reasonable requirements' (and in bringing in 
  contributions to welfare only as a sort of fine-tuning of the 'reasonable 
  requirements' test). Like him I think that that entitles (and indeed requires) 
  this court to exercise its own discretion. I agree with him that (for the 
  reasons which he gives) that does not lead to the conclusion that there should 
  be the equal (or near-equal) division for which Miss Baron has contended. I 
  agree that this appeal should be allowed and that the lump-sum provision for 
  Mrs Cowan should be increased from £1.775m to £3.0m, leaving all the other 
  provisions of the judge's order undisturbed. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>LORD JUSTICE MANCE:</B></P>
  <LI value=108><A name=order108>The basic contours of this appeal are clear. 
  They are mapped more fully in the judgment of Thorpe LJ, with the benefit of 
  which I can confine myself to outlines. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=109><A name=order109>The appeal concerns a long marriage, contracted 
  in 1959 when Mr Cowan was 19 and Mrs Cowan 17. Sons were born in 1959 and 
  1963. There was a final separation, against Mrs Cowan's wishes, in 1994. Mr 
  and Mrs Cowan were divorced in Spring 2000. When they married, they were 
  without means. By the time they separated, their assets, mainly accumulated by 
  and belonging to the husband, were very substantial. It is sufficient to take 
  round figures, and I gratefully adopt those in the table set out in Robert 
  Walker J's judgment. In summary, at 31<SUP>st</SUP> July 2000, when Singer J. 
  gave his judgment under s.25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, as amended, 
  the principal home, Hadham Grange, Much Hadham (held since 1992 in joint 
  names) was worth £1.1 million; the husband was held to have other net assets 
  totalling nearly £10.2 million, and the wife had other net assets totalling 
  £245,000. Total net assets were over £11.5 million. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=110><A name=order110>This accumulation of wealth was due to the 
  successful development over the years of various plastics businesses and the 
  recent part disposal of a major interest in such businesses. The wife was 
  involved in the first of these businesses, Hanmere Ltd. ("Hanmere") in the 
  very early years (the 1960s and possibly early 1970s). At the start she was 
  indeed the only person actively involved in that business, which involved 
  small-scale merchandising of polythene sheeting, buying from wholesalers and 
  reselling to retailers. At trial, much of her case was aimed at establishing 
  that her resulting contribution to the overall success had been significant. 
  In this she failed. The judge held: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"50. I have no reasons to suppose that, whatever the extent of 
    her involvement, W was other than conscientious and energetic. But I am 
    quite unable to ascribe to her involvement anything other than a minor role 
    in the overall development of these businesses, which clearly was engineered 
    and directed by H. .
    <P></P>
    <P>51. It is, in my view, quite simply unrealistic for W to say . That 
    during the early 1970s H totally took over "my executive responsibility". Of 
    course she may have contributed ideas in the early stages, but the reality 
    was that she telephoned and canvassed orders, picked up and delivered goods, 
    and managed to combine that and no doubt a modest degree of bookkeeping with 
    running the home and caring for the children.</P>
    <P>52. W's case remains however that without the initial groundwork which 
    she did in this period there would have been no polythene business to 
    develop into what today exists. In a causal sense this may to a degree be 
    true. But the initial steps which she took, although by no means 
    insignificant, weigh light in the balance by contrast to the contribution 
    made by H's entrepreneurial flair and his technical knowledge and 
    inventiveness."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=111><A name=order111>In short, although it may be that Mr Cowan 
  would never have given up his other activity as a draughtsman and engaged 
  full-time in polythene, but for his wife's previous engagement, the initial 
  and somewhat basic business of buying and selling polythene was not the source 
  of the subsequent success and wealth. That was due to Mr Cowan's own 
  resourceful and determined expansion into other fields. In the course of Mr 
  Cowan's evidence, Miss Baron expressly accepted him as an innovative and 
  expert business-man, and did not cross-examine on his account of what had been 
  achieved. His evidence showed that in 1968 he moved Hanmere from distribution 
  of polythene into the manufacture of polythene bags from bought-in film. In 
  1970, Hanmere joined the then very limited number of polythene film 
  manufacturers. It bought granules from oil companies and extruding polythene 
  into tubes for manufacture into bags. Mr Cowan was the first or second 
  manufacturer to see the savings to be made by eliminating the intermediate 
  stage, and (using a process kept secret for years) making bags direct from 
  film. Later he was at the forefront of development of multi-layered bags. 
  During a visit to a chemical company in Zurich, he realised the potential of 
  high density polythene in its experimental stage, and established HD Plastics 
  ("HD") to make thin bags and sacks; he was a prime-mover in the introduction 
  of bin-liners, using high density polythene, into this country; seeing their 
  potential for use in lieu of dust-bins; he persuaded Guildford City Council to 
  adopt them, and other local authorities followed suit, to the point where HD 
  held half the national market (some 200 million bags a year). When local 
  authorities began to use wheelie bins, he realised the attraction, as an 
  alternative outlet, of the bags on rolls which feature in almost every 
  supermarket. To meet the expectations of the supermarkets who became HD's 
  customers, he built through Inca Properties Ltd. ("Inca") a factory for HD 
  which won the Best Small Factory Award. Halcyon Plastics Ltd. ("Halcyon") was 
  established and run on a day by day basis by his brother, Graham (who held, on 
  Mr Cowan's case, 30% and, on the wife's case, 49% of the shares). Halcyon was 
  at first unsuccessful, but was subsequently re-organised to prosper in the 
  international merchandising of plastics and other commodities. In the 
  mid-1980s, Mr Cowan, with assistance from Jeffrey and great effort, surmounted 
  what he described as the "very destructive" loss of his managing and sales 
  directors, with office and factory staff and sales records. Hanlex Ltd. 
  ("Hanlex"), formed to develop "zippable" bags, to ensure the safe re-sealing 
  of the contents of, for example, Muesli packets, was one venture which, 
  perhaps surprisingly, did not prosper. Mr Cowan was also shrewd in the way in 
  which, with expert legal and accountancy assistance, he achieved a very 
  favourable (or, as it was termed before the judge, "sub-standard") settlement 
  with the Inland Revenue in 1996, involving payment of only [sic] £2,511,000 
  and dismemberment of the "sham" trust structures by which Halcyon, Hanlex and 
  Inca had been held abroad, as well as in the way in which he realised his 
  interest by selling the major business of HD to Baco Consumer Products Ltd. 
  ("Baco") in and after 1997. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Impact on the Judge's Judgment of <I>White v White</B> </I></P>
  <LI value=112><A name=order112>The judge sought to exercise the discretion 
  conferred by s.25 in a manner consistent with previous authority in this 
  court. At one point he expressly rejected an invitation by Miss Baron QC for 
  Mrs Cowan to "break new ground". Since his judgment, the House of Lords has 
  handed down its decision in <I>White v White</I> <A 
  href="../../../../../uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2000] 3 WLR 1571</a></A>. 
  The leading speech of Lord Nicholls in that case urges a return to the 
  language of s.25, and the abandonment of any test or attempt to paraphrase 
  that section in terms of "reasonable requirements". Lord Nicholls said at page 
  1581E-G: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The statutory provisions lend no support to the idea that a 
    claimant's financial needs, even interpreted generously and called 
    reasonable requirements, are to be regarded as determinative. Another factor 
    to which the court is bidden to have particular regard is the available 
    resources of the parties. . [S]ection 25(2) does not rank the matters 
    listed in that subsection in any kind of hierarchy. The weight, or 
    importance, to be attached to these matters depends upon the facts of the 
    particular case. But I can see nothing, either in the statutory provisions 
    or in the underlying objective of securing fair financial arrangements, to 
    lead me to suppose that the available assets of the respondent become 
    immaterial once the claimant wife's financial needs are satisfied. Why ever 
    should they? ."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=113><A name=order113>Miss Baron submits that <I>White v White</I> 
  undermines the judge's reasoning and conclusion. Mr Pointer QC for Mr Cowan 
  submits that the judge's reasoning and conclusion remain valid. Alternatively, 
  and acknowledging the tension between these two submissions, he submits that, 
  if the judges' reasoning fails to take full account of the principles and 
  considerations relevant under <I>White v White</I>, the matter requires to be 
  remitted for further consideration by the trial judge. It is in these 
  circumstances necessary to consider precisely how Singer J. viewed and decided 
  the case below. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=114><A name=order114>A major factor, to which the judge said that he 
  gave "significant weight", was the length of the marriage. Then in paragraphs 
  145-147 he said this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"145 .. Another factor which weighs heavily (although not with 
    the weight for which W has contended) is the balance of contributions which 
    each of the spouses has made over the effective duration of their marriage, 
    thirty-five years until separation 6 years ago.
    <P></P>
    <P>146 H's contribution is manifest. It can be measured crudely in the 
    assessment of the resources which I have undertaken, and which puts a 
    monetary valuation upon his drive, vision and inventiveness. It is clearly 
    the case that his businesses have for many years absorbed his energies and 
    his time. He is clearly an exceptionally hard worker.</P>
    <P>147 It is in this context that W's contributions must be assessed. Of 
    course I take into account the extent (although I have found it to be modest 
    in the scope of the whole) to which she contributed to the germination of 
    the seed of these businesses before they really flourished and spread. But 
    that is just one ingredient in the contribution to the welfare of the family 
    which she made over all those years. For the necessary consequence of the 
    time and energy which H put towards his work is the extra burden of 
    responsibility which inevitably W would have to meet in bringing up the 
    children and organising the life of the family."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=115><A name=order115>The judge then rejected the invitation to

    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=116><A name=order116>His reasons for rejecting this invitation were

  Another factor was this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"For when I set the outcome Miss Baron suggests as reasonable 
    (although, in the nature of things, no doubt the highest reasonable, rather 
    than the lowest reasonable, outcome) against what I have found to be the 
    measure of this family's wealth, it is apparent that equality need not be 
    invoked to reach it. And, as will be evident in the result, Miss Baron has 
    not undersold her client's case by pitching it too low."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=117><A name=order117>This refers to the fact that, although Miss 
  Baron did submit below that "broad equality" would be fair, when it came to 
  the figures, she limited the wife's claim to some £4 million, or about 35% of 
  the total assets. Her expressed reason was partly the way in which the scope 
  of the husband's assets had emerged during the trial and partly, it seems, a 
  recognition that previous authority was against her. The judge's comment, in 
  the passage last quoted, remains, however, to my mind somewhat opaque. Miss 
  Baron was not ultimately contending for, and the judge was not accepting, 
  equality as the test. But neither was Miss Baron accepting a test of 
  "reasonable requirements". The judge did not indicate whether he was referring

  "reasonable" outcome. </A>

  <LI value=119><A name=order119>In paragraphs 149-150 and 158, he then 
  commended and adopted the approach and analysis set out by Wilson J in 
  <I>Conran v Conran</I> [1997] 2 FLR 615, in the passage headed "The Law" 
  commencing at page 623B. That approach and analysis was primarily concerned 
  with the nature and significance of a wife's contribution under s.25. It had 
  two relevant aspects. First, Wilson J identified an issue of formulation, 
  namely whether such a contribution bore on the "reasonableness" of a wife's 
  requirements in the context of an overall test of "reasonable requirements" to 
  be derived from s.25 (an approach suggested by reasoning of Thorpe LJ in 
  <I>Hart v Hart</I> [19967] 2 FLR 286, 296-7), or whether it was an additional 
  factor to be placed in the balance after reasonable requirements had been 
  ascertained. He saw this as an interesting, though probably academic issue, 
  but preferred the latter view. Now that the House of Lords in <I>White v 
  White</I> has suggested that courts would do well to avoid the concept of 
  "reasonable requirements", neither formulation is appropriate. Secondly, 
  Wilson J assimilated a wife's family contribution in the home with a working 
  husband's financial contribution, quoting (as did Singer J. below) words of 
  Purchas LJ in <I>Vicary v Vicary</I> [1992] 2 FLR 271, 289: </A>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I regret that I am unable to accept Mr Connell's submission 
    that there is in some way a distinction to be drawn between those cases in 
    which the wife makes an actual financial contribution to the assets of the 
    family and those in which her contribution is indirect inasmuch as she 
    supplies the infrastructure and support in the context of which the husband 
    is able to work hard, prosper and accumulate his wealth. I can find no 
    justification in logic or authority for making an arbitrary distinction of 
    this kind. Of course the value of the contribution, whether direct or 
    indirect, is one of the factors which are properly to be taken into account 
    when applying s.25 to the exercise of determining what the lump sum should 
    be. In making the comparison, it is for the judge to assess the worth of the 
    wife's contribution; but this is essentially a matter for him."

  <LI value=120><A name=order120>This passage was not quoted in the speeches in 
  <I>White v White</I>. But its first two sentences, at least, are clear 
  precursors to what Lord Nicholls said there at page 1578D-G: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Typically, a husband and wife share the activities of earning 
    money, running their home and caring for their children. Traditionally, the 
    husband earned the money, and the wife looked after the home and the 
    children. This traditional division of labour is no longer the order of the 
    day. Frequently both parents work. Sometimes it is the wife who is the 
    money-earner, and the husband runs the home and cares for the children 
    during the day. But whatever the division of labour chosen by the husband 
    and wife, or forced upon them by circumstances, fairness requires that this 
    should not prejudice or advantage either party when considering para (f) of 
    s 25(2) of the 1973 Act, relating to the parties' contributions. This is 
    implicit in the very language of para (f):' the contribution which<I> 
    each</I> of the parties has made or is likely  to make to the<I> welfare of 
    the family</I>, including any contribution by looking after the home or 
    caring for the family.' (Emphasis added.) If, in their different spheres, 
    each contributed equally to the family, then in principle it matters not 
    which of them earned the money and built up the assets. There should be no 
    bias in favour of the money-earner and against the homemaker and the 
    child-carer."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=121><A name=order121>Singer J. then turned in paragraph 151 of his 
  judgment to "my assessment of W's reasonable requirements". In the course of 
  making that assessment, he considered, at paragraph 154, whether he should 
  assume that Mrs Cowan would move to a less expensive house in five years or at 
  some other point. He declined to do so, saying that this was "precisely the 
  sort of area upon which the nature and duration of W's contribution impinges". 
  This seems to me, however, rather to adopt the first formulation identified by 
  Wilson J in <I>Conran v Conran</I> than that which Wilson J had actually 
  preferred. Later, the judge returned expressly to the alternative formulations 
  mentioned by Wilson J and said at paragraph 159: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It seems to me entirely consistent with either approach where 
    (as here) length of marriage and nature of contribution enhance entitlement, 
    or (as might in another case) some other feature call for special 
    contribution [sic], to tailor the shape and function of the award rather 
    than just to move it up or down in monetary terms. And so in this case I 
    regard it as fair to both parties that the shape of W's future life should 
    encompass the ability to spend some months of each year in her own home 
    abroad, and that the function of the lump sum provision that H should make 
    for her is to enable her to continue to live between her two homes, if she 
    wishes, for life."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=122><A name=order122>Adopting that approach, he arrived at £100,000 
  per annum as the amount for which capital provision should be paid to her by 
  H, on the basis that she would also have the benefit of her own pension 
  entitlement and her existing modest unearned income. Applying the 
  <I>Duxbury</I> approach, he arrived at a figure of £1.58 million. That, after 
  taking into account his order that Mr Cowan discharge the mortgage debt on her 
  Florida property and on Hadham Grange and transfer to her his interest in 
  Hadham Grange, led him to order that Mr Cowan pay Mrs Cowan a lump sum of 
  £1.775 million. As a final stage in the process, the judge said in paragraph 
  167 that he had surveyed the overall effect of the order, and that, set 
  against the scale of the parties' overall wealth, it did not seem to him 
  unfair to either party. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=123><A name=order123>The judge's starting point was therefore a test 
  of "reasonable requirements". He acknowledged that contribution could have 
  relevance, either in expanding the scope of what might be "reasonable" in this 
  context, or, as Wilson J had preferred to see it, as an additional factor to 
  weigh in the balance after ascertaining reasonable requirements. But it was on 
  the <I>requirements </I>of Mrs Cowan, in the sense of her needs and wishes to 
  enable her to maintain her accustomed life-style, that the judge focused 
  centrally. He viewed the exercise of his statutory discretion through a prism 
  that the House of Lords has subsequently rejected as inappropriate and 
  confusing. He cannot be criticised. No-one wanted his judgment to be withheld 
  pending the uncertain date of the Lords' ruling in <I>White v White</I>. 
  However, in my view, the reasoning and decision in <I>White v White</I> 
  undermine the judge's reasoning in the present case. A re-exercise of the 
  statutory discretion is called for, either by this court or, if we conclude 
  that we cannot undertake the exercise, then by remission to the trial judge.

  <P><B>Factors relevant to the exercise of discretion following <I>White v 
  White</B></I></P>
  <LI value=124><A name=order124>Freed from the constraint of previous 
  authority, Miss Baron's case before us became by amendment that there should 
  be effective equality in the overall split of assets. She seeks, in lieu of 
  the order that Mr Cowan pay £1,775,000, an order for payment of £4,600,000 
  (with Mrs Cowan taking Hadham Grange and her own limited assets as before). 
  Before addressing the rival submissions on this aspect further, I shall 
  however necessary note three points raised by Mr Pointer relating to the 
  nature and extent of the relevant assets. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>(a) Jeffrey</B></P>
  <LI value=125><A name=order125>First, Mr Pointer submits that the judge ought, 
  in his figures, to have taken account of a beneficial entitlement of Mr 
  Cowan's brother, Jeffrey, to shares in Halcyon, in HD (and in its proceeds on 
  and after the sale to Baco) and in Inca. Any interest Jeffrey might have in 
  Halcyon is in fact financially irrelevant, since both parties accept that Mr 
  Cowan held no more than 51% of the shares. The difference between the parties 
  was whether the 49% belonged exclusively to Graham or whether it was split 
  between Graham and Jeffrey in the proportions of 30% and 19%. Whether Jeffrey 
  had a 20% interest in HD (and so in its proceeds) and Inca is however 
  significant. Mr Pointer submits that the judge accepted Jeffrey's entitlement, 
  but failed to take it into account financially. I cannot accept that 
  submission. Mr Cowan asserted on affidavit that he held 20% of the shares on 
  trust for Jeffrey. The issue before the judge was whether that was so. Singer 
  J determined that issue against Mr Cowan. He took an adverse view of Mr 
  Cowan's credibility on it. He said at paragraph 100: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I therefore without any real doubt, having heard and seen H and 
    the witnesses he relied upon on this topic, conclude that this aspect of the 
    case has been an attempt by H deliberately to maintain a presentation for 
    which he must be aware there is no firm foundation whatsoever."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=126><A name=order126>Earlier, in paragraph 88, he said that Mr 
  Cowan's evidence had </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"totally failed to persuade me that the position is as he 
    represented it, either in relation to any firm understanding or agreement 
    between the brothers prior to the dismemberment of the Jersey Trust, nor 
    [sic] as to any such agreement in any way binding upon H at the time of the 
    Inland Revenue negotiations or subsequently."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=127><A name=order127>In paragraph 89, he used language on which Mr 
  Pointer relies. He said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In my judgment H has behaved, not as a man who has made a 
    perfected gift or entered into a contractual arrangement, but more like a 
    trustee (or perhaps a more appropriate word might be "protector") of a 
    discretionary trust, of which JC (and indeed GC) were potential 
    beneficiaries. I do not believe that he has been prepared in relation to any 
    of these companies to commit himself to parting with the actual shares or 
    their value. I believe that the same must go for the Baco shares and for the 
    loan notes."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=128><A name=order128>Mr Pointer submits that the judge here accepted 
  that shares were held on trust for Mr Cowan's two brothers, Jeffrey and 
  Graham. But that would mean that Mr Cowan had, contrary to the judge's express 
  further statement, parted with the shares. The judge's analogy was not I think 
  felicitous. The Jersey trust, which apparently held the shares in Halcyon, HD 
  and Inca was (admittedly) a sham (paragraph 32). Mr Cowan remained in 
  effective and absolute control. It is clear that all the judge meant was that 
  Mr Cowan viewed the shares, wherever they were lodged, as his to retain or to 
  distribute among or between himself and in particular his brothers (but in 
  reality anyone else he might choose) as and when he wished. In legal terms, Mr 
  Cowan remained the legal and beneficial owner of the shares in HD (until the 
  sale to Baco) and Inca. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=129><A name=order129>Shortly before the appeal, Mr Pointer sought an 
  extension of time and permission for service of a respondents' notice, 
  challenging the judge's findings, if and to the extent we concluded that the 
  judge had held Mr Cowan to remain the legal and beneficial owner of such 
  shares. We refused the application, but on the basis that the refusal did not 
  prevent Mr Pointer from contending that he was free to argue that the judge's 
  finding in paragraph 89 was a factor that the court should give weight to in 
  assessing overall fairness in accordance with <I>White v White</I>. Mr Pointer 
  subsequently contended that a moral obligation to dispose of assets in a 
  particular way could be relevant under <I>White v White</I>, and that 
  paragraph 89 supported the view that there had been or may have been such an 
  obligation. Had the hearing taken place after <I>White v White</I>, the moral 
  obligation point would, he submitted, have been investigated, and accordingly, 
  there should be a further hearing before Singer J. to investigate it now. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=130><A name=order130>Again, I am unable to accept this submission. 
  Had there been any basis for assertin<U>g</U> a moral obligation, it could 
  have been very helpful to Mr Cowan in explaining and justifying his case that 
  he held 20% of the shares on trust. Indeed, there were efforts to give the 
  alleged trust a "rationale", beyond the mere explanation of family generosity. 
  The rationale included alleged loans by Hanmere to HD which supposedly 
  "kick-started" HD and alleged work done by Jeffrey in relation to HD (see 
  judgment paragraph 35). The judge evidently thought little of either aspect of 
  the suggested rationale. I do not doubt that a moral obligation could in the 
  right circumstances be of relevance, when considering the appropriate 
  distribution between spouses of accumulated wealth. One may, for example, 
  think of a spouse who was, with his or her partner's knowledge and consent, 
  accustomed to support a parent or siblings or other relatives or a small 
  charity, in circumstances where the relative or charity would depend on 
  further support for the future. Surely, the wish to continue such support 
  would be entitled to some weight, although how much would depend on the other 
  circumstances. Here, however, Jeffrey, has been, on the face of it, 
  well-rewarded in the past for such activity and involvement as he had, which 
  was also, principally, in the early years. He has a substantial (44%) 
  share-holding in Hanmere worth some £880,000 in 2000, and he continues to 
  receive out of Hanmere pension, salary and other benefits worth over £125,000 
  in 1998. He has received a house in the Canary Isles worth some £236,000. 
  Between 1996 (when the Inland Revenue investigation was determined by 
  settlement) and 1998 (when divorce proceedings began) Mr Cowan toyed with the 
  idea of giving, but never actually gave Jeffrey, any further asset. We have 
  been shown no material to suggest that there is or could be any moral 
  obligation to afford further support. Further, if and so far as Mr Cowan may 
  in future wish to give his brother, Jeffrey, further money or assets (as I 
  accept that he might well, if for example Jeffrey fell on hard times), he will 
   even on an equal division of assets with Mrs Cowan  retain plenty of 
  personal assets out of which to be generous. That point is reinforced, if the 
  division of assets is not ultimately in equal shares. I therefore see no basis 
  on which we would be justified in ordering a further hearing to go over 
  essentially old ground on which the judge reached clear findings. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>(b) The relevant date at which to consider the parties' assets</B></P>
  <LI value=131><A name=order131>Mr Pointer submits that the court should look 
  at the nature and extent of the assets in 1994 when the parties finally 
  separated, or should at least take account of that separation and of the 
  substantial subsequent increase in assets due, in particular, to the take-over 
  of HD by Baco in 1997 and Baco's subsequent disposal in 2000. This increase 
  was also, he submits, a result of Mr Cowan's business acuity. He further 
  submits that at trial it was irrelevant and unnecessary to go into this 
  aspect; Mr Cowan and his advisers were, on the then state of the law, 
  justified in assuming that Mrs Cowan's claim could be effectively restricted 
  by reference to her (reasonable) requirements. Only since <I>White v White</I> 
  has the relevance of extra assets emerged, and the court should allow 
  investigation of the time at which and reasons for which they emerged, by 
  directing a further hearing. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=132><A name=order132>I start with Mr Pointer's basic submission that 
  the date of separation represents a cut-off date. I am unable to agree with 
  it. I note that s.25(2)(a) itself requires the court, when exercising its 
  power to make among other things a property adjustment order, to have regard 
  to, inter alia, </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>". the income, earning capacity, property and other financial 
    resources which each of the parties to the marriage <I>has or is likely to 
    have</I> in the foreseeable future ." (emphasis added)
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=133><A name=order133>Further, the date of the exercise of the 
  court's power is not only accepted to be the traditional date but is, as it 
  seems to me, also the natural date in a case such as the present. Here the 
  parties have lived apart, either content or obliged to wait before any 
  divorce. The bulk of the assets was in the meantime the husband's and under 
  his control. He could do with it as he wished. She had no opportunity to use 
  the assets or to increase them in the meanwhile. If the husband lost the 
  monies, the wife would suffer. If he added to them, one might expect the wife 
  to benefit. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=134><A name=order134>We were referred to reasoning of Coleridge J. 
  in <I>N v N</I> (unrep'd; 28/01/01), where he thought that there was 
  "intrinsically some merit . in this particular case" in an argument that he 
  should "take into account the huge increase in the value of the X group since 
  the separation". But Coleridge J went on to say that he was quite sure that 
  even now in most cases the date of the hearing was the correct date of 
  valuation. It was only "where there has been a very significant change 
  accounted for by more than just inflation or deflation" that he thought that 
  "the court must have an eye to the valuation at the date of separation". The 
  crux of his thinking appears in the next paragraph, where he said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In this case the increase in value is attributable to extra 
    investment of time, effort and money by the husband since separation and I 
    do take into account the exceptionally steep increase in the turnover 
    figures since the date of separation."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=135><A name=order135>What Coleridge J. was doing was not undertaking 
  the whole valuation exercise at a different date from that prescribed, as I 
  see it, by the statute as well as by tradition, but taking into account, as a 
  potentially relevant factor, that it was only by virtue of the husband's extra 
  work and money that the "huge increase" in value between separation and 
  hearing had occurred. That links with the issue to which I have to return, to 
  what extent, if any, is it now relevant to seek to evaluate the contribution 
  made by either party to the overall wealth as at the date of the hearing. If 
  this is relevant at all, then it may be that one party's special skill in 
  accumulating assets will achieve some added weight as a factor if it occurs 
  after separation, but before any divorce or financial hearing. This may be so, 
  despite the countervailing consideration to which I have already adverted, 
  which applies where such a party is in effect trading with and risking the 
  wife's as yet unascertained part of the overall assets existing at separation. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=136><A name=order136>Assuming that the substantial increase in 
  assets since 1994 may be relevant in this way, having regard to its origin in 
  the husband's special skill, I still see no need or call for the remission to 
  the judge which Mr Pointer invited. In my judgment, the court has sufficient 
  information before it, as a result of the judgment and counsels' submissions, 
  for it to undertake the broad assessment called for by the statute. In 
  <I>White v White</I> Lord Nicholls referred to the need to avoid detailed and 
  disproportionately expensive investigations in carrying out the statutory 
  exercise: see pages 1584F-1585D. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>(c) Nature and Liquidity of assets</B></P>
  <LI value=137><A name=order137>Mr Pointer submits that the court should take 
  account of the extent to which the husband's assets consisted of (a) the 
  capitalisation of anticipated income and (b) illiquid assets. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=138><A name=order138>The capital sum of £1,190,000 included in the 
  judge's calculations in respect of Mr Cowan's pension falls into both 
  categories. It can only be taken as an annuity, and might (in case of early 
  death) never be received. Mrs Cowan's assets, on the other hand, include a 
  much smaller pension fund of £245,000, including £60,000 already vested. There 
  is therefore a substantial difference between the parties' pension assets. Mr 
  Cowan's entitlement represents, nonetheless, reasonably assured income while 
  Mr Cowan lives, and its capital value takes into account the actuarial risk of 
  his demise. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=139><A name=order139>Mr Cowan's continuing share interests in 
  Hanmere (about £1.05 million) and Halcyon (about £400,000) may in some degree 
  be instances of the latter. On the other hand, they are profitable, 
  income-yielding share interests, they are run on a day-to-day basis by its 
  long-standing managing director, Mr Vincent, and Mr Cowan has shown his 
  ability to realise favourable disposals of such assets, in relation to HD. The 
  shares in Inca, a property company, must on any view be readily disposable. Mr 
  Pointer submits, nonetheless, that the ability to realise calls for further 
  investigation. I accept that, in principle, the nature and liquidity of assets 
  constitute relevant circumstances. In particular, I accept that we should bear 
  in mind that Mr Cowan may wish at some stage to have (like Mrs Cowan) a larger 
  property, in lieu of or in addition to his Hampstead flat, and that he may 
  also wish to re-expand his business activity, rather than to contract it. But 
  I cannot see these as factors of any great significance here - even if one 
  does ultimately view this as a case for equal division of assets overall. Mr 
  Cowan will on any view be very liquid indeed. Following the disposal of Baco 
  and repayment of the loan notes, he has or will have some £6.8 million in 
  cash, net after allowing for capital gains tax. He was due to receive nearly 
  £500,000 from the sale of Flag Hill, in the Virgin Islands. His indebtedness 
  amounted to no more than £750,000 (plus the mortgage of some £420,000 on his 
  Hampstead flat). </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Fairness</B></P>
  <LI value=140><A name=order140>I come back therefore to the basic issue: what 
  does fairness require in all the circumstances, by way of split of assets 
  between these two parties? Starting with the particular circumstances to which 
  s.25(2) requires the court to have regard, I have already identified the 
  parties' property and other financial resources. Their income potential is 
  either self-evident (as in the case of the cash received following the sale of 
  the Baco interests and repayment of the loan notes) or demonstrated by past 
  profitability (as in the case of the remaining share-holdings in Hanmere and 
  Halcyon). Certain of the assets, such as Hadham Grange and the husband's less 
  valuable property in Hampstead are not of course income producing. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=141><A name=order141>Mr Cowan is still evidently a capable and 
  active business-man, capable in all likelihood of deploying his skill and 
  remaining business assets to good effect. Mrs Cowan, on the other hand, while 
  clearly a strong character able and willing to play a determined and active 
  part in business in the early years, has devoted herself to her husband and 
  family for so long now, that there can be no real prospect of her engaging in 
  any further business activity, although no doubt she will invest such assets 
  as she may acquire under this judgment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=142><A name=order142>The 35 year duration of the marriage prior to 
  separation (over 40 years, if one takes the date of divorce) makes this a 
  marriage which might, in happier circumstances, have been described as a 
  life-time's partnership. Its duration, the parties' ages and the factors 
  mentioned in the last paragraph are at the root of Miss Baron's submission 
  that the case calls for equality of treatment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=143><A name=order143>The parties' financial needs, in order to 
  maintain the life-style to which they have been accustomed, may be taken in

  needs were not separately evaluated, but it would seem fair to take them at no 
  less, despite the fact that his Hampstead flat will probably involve less cost 
  and maintenance than Hadham Grange. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=144><A name=order144>Earlier in this judgment, I have set out or 
  summarised the judge's findings regarding the contributions which each party 
  had made to the welfare of the family, including the contribution made (by Mrs 
  Cowan in particular) by looking after the home and caring for the family. Mr 
  Cowan's financial success contributed very substantially to the physical 
  welfare of the family. The family lived well; and this is not a case where the 
  pursuit or possession of wealth appears to have been harmful to the family as 
  a whole or individually or to the quality of their family life. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=145><A name=order145>As to the foreseeable future, the children of 
  the marriage are long grown-up, but the younger, Timothy, in particular has 
  been receiving support from Mrs Cowan since ceasing to be employed in Hanlex, 
  Mr Cowan's one unsuccessful venture (intended to pioneer the use of resealable 
  plastic strips on polythene bags). Hanlex was closed down not long prior to 
  the trial. Timothy was, with his family, then allowed use of Mrs Cowan's 
  Florida flat and latterly to share Hadham Grange. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=146><A name=order146>Miss Baron submits that not only is Mrs Cowan 
  in this context engaged in providing continuing support for a child of the 
  marriage, but there is no reason why her natural wish to be able to give, or 
  leave, money to her children in the future should not also be taken into 
  account as a relevant circumstance. That such a wish (although not a "need" 
  within paragraph (b)) may have relevance to the exercise under section 25, 
  where overall assets far exceed any needs, is confirmed by Lord Nicholls' 
  speech in <I>White v White</I> at page 1582H. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=147><A name=order147>I have identified the factual circumstances

  parties' respective submissions. Bearing in mind the length of the marriage, 
  both parties' submissions in this case were concentrated magnetically (to take 
  a word used by Thorpe LJ in this context in this court in <I>White v 
  White</I>) upon the parties' "contributions" during the marriage. Miss Baron's 
  main theme is that the only relevant question is whether each party had done 
  "as much as he or she could" to contribute to the welfare of the family. If 
  each had, then equality followed naturally. She emphasised Lord Nicholls' "one 
  principle of universal application", namely that there could be no 
  discrimination between the domestic and business spheres, in which Mrs Cowan 
  and Mr Cowan, respectively, had here been principally active. Each sphere and 
  contribution must be accorded full value. Since there was no suggestion that 
  either had failed to do all he or she could have done, Mr and Mrs Cowan's 
  contributions should be regarded as equal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=149><A name=order149>During argument, she conceded that there might 
  be cases where one particular party had made a "stellar" contribution to 
  extraordinary wealth, meriting special consideration, but submitted that this 
  was not such a case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=150><A name=order150>Mr Pointer in contrast highlighted as relevant 
  considerations the husband's entrepreneurial flair, technical knowledge and 
  inventiveness and "exceptional" hard work, and their roles as the prime cause 
  of accumulation of very great wealth. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=151><A name=order151>To the extent that the husband's skill and 
  industry contributed directly to the welfare of the family, without harmful 
  side-effects, this is certainly relevant under paragraph (f) of s.25(2). So 
  too is the fact that Mrs Cowan throughout a long marriage did all she could 
  (mainly though not exclusively on the domestic front) to contribute to the 
  welfare of the family. I agree that these two contributions to the welfare of 
  the family can well be regarded as balancing out. It is apposite to repeat 
  what Lord Nicholls said at page 1578F: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"If, in their different spheres, each contributed equally to the 
    family, then in principle it matters not which of them earned the money and 
    built up the assets. There should be no bias in favour of the money-earner 
    and against the homemaker and the child-carer."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=152><A name=order152>The mere fact that the husband, by 
  entrepreneurial flair, technical knowledge, inventiveness and exceptional hard 
  work, has contributed to a higher standard of living than another less gifted 
  or hard-working husband might have done does not seem to me to affect the 
  position. The wife in a long marriage will, after all, have been accustomed to 
  that standard of living, and will have helped organise and maintain it. 
  Further, by devoting herself to domestic life, Mrs Cowan in the present case 
  forewent the opportunity to develop her own business or income, of which the 
  initiative she showed in early years (prior to and during her marriage) 
  suggest that she may well have been capable. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=153><A name=order153>The problem presents itself in this case, as in 
  <I>White v White</I>, that the assets accumulated considerably exceed the 
  parties' needs. There, in rejecting any suggestion that the available assets 
  (to which paragraph (a) requires attention) become immaterial once a wife's 
  financial needs are satisfied, Lord Nicholls said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Why ever should they? If a husband and wife by their joint 
    efforts over many years, his directly in his business and hers indirectly at 
    home, have built up a valuable business from scratch, why should the 
    claimant wife be confined to the court's assessment of reasonable 
    requirements, and the husband left with a much larger share? Or, to put the 
    question differently, in such a case, where the assets exceed the financial 
    needs of both parties, why should the surplus belong solely to the husband? 
    On the facts of a particular case there may be a good reason why the wife 
    should be confined to her needs and the husband left with the much larger 
    balance. But the mere absence of financial need cannot, by itself, be a 
    sufficient reason. If it were, discrimination would be creeping in by the 
    back door. In these cases, it should be remembered, the claimant is usually 
    the wife. Hence the importance of the check against the yardstick of equal 
    division."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=154><A name=order154>This passage dealt, however, with a factual 
  situation different from that actually present in <I>White v White</I>. It was 
  <I>primarily</I> concerned to negate any suggestion that a wife whose 
  contribution is domestic alone should be confined to her reasonable 
  requirements or needs. When it came to the actual factual situation in 
  <I>White v White</I>, Lord Nicholls identified as "a notable aspect of the 
  equality of contribution" the fact that the husband and wife had a "business 
  partnership" which "was a reality" (page 1576B). Miss Baron submitted to us 
  that this statement was mere narrative, which Lord Nicholls did not later 
  adopt. But it seems to me relevant to an understanding of the actual decision 
  in <I>White v White</I>. In upholding the Court of Appeal's exercise of 
  discretion, and in considering that it was legitimate to "increase Mrs White's 
  award to an amount substantially in excess of her share of their joint 
  assets", Lord Nicholls drew express attention at page 1585B to the fact that 
  the Court of Appeal had had in mind (a) all the available assets, (b) Mr 
  White's father's significant (monetary) contribution to the original farm 
  purchase, (c) "Mrs White's dual role as business partner and as wife and 
  mother" and (d) the overall goal of fairness. Lord Cooke at page 1588F also 
  underlined that Mrs White "was an active partner in the farming business as 
  well as meeting the responsibilities of wife and mother". The farm assets that 
  Mr and Mrs White had acquired and developed were essentially the fruits of 
  their joint efforts and collaboration assets, apart from the important initial 
  contribution made by Mr White's father. The House of Lords did not regard it 
  as appropriate to approach their division by taking or even starting with a 
  technical analysis of their legal interests. It took a broad view of their 
  co-operation and contributions. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=155><A name=order155>Here, although both cases concern the 
  accumulation of surplus assets during a long marriage, the other circumstances 
  are far removed from those in <I>White v White</I>. Mr and Mrs Cowan were not 
   save at the very outset and then only in relation to a primitive business - 
  in business or in partnership together. Mr Cowan's special business skills, 
  acumen and efforts have led him to accumulate a very large wealth. His legal 
  ownership of position is not the starting point, any more than in a situation 
  like <I>White v White</I>. But we do have to evaluate the relevance or 
  relative significance of, on the one hand, Mr Cowan's special achievement and, 
  on the other hand, the parties' long partnership in marriage. This, I must 
  confess, I do not find easy. One must be cautious about any generalisations. 
  The exercise of the discretion conferred under s.25 is highly fact specific. 
  It may however be useful to consider some possible cases; all assume a 
  long-term marriage, any children of which are grown-up and independent, a 
  husband who works and a wife whose contribution to the family welfare has been 
  domestic: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the husband's work may have produced sufficient (but no more 
    than sufficient) assets to enable both parties, after divorce, to be housed 
    and to continue to live in the manner to which they have become used;
    <P></P>
    <P>(b) the husband may, either by special skill and/or effort, have 
    accumulated not only assets sufficient for, but wealth surplus to, the 
    purpose indicated in (a);</P>
    <P>(c) the husband may, have accumulated assets surplus to that purpose, 
    without any special skill or effort;</P>
    <P>(d) one or other party may have acquired assets before, and brought them 
    into, the marriage or may, during the marriage, have acquired assets from a 
    third party by inheritance, in which case such assets may themselves either 
    (i) be required for that purpose or (ii) be, at least in part, surplus to 
    that purpose.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=156><A name=order156>In case (a), I believe that there would 
  commonly be little doubt but that the assets accumulated by the husband should 
  be divided so as to enable both parties to continue to live as accustomed. 
  That would have been of the essence of the old test of "reasonable 
  requirements". Likewise, in case (d)(i), the consideration that property was 
  acquired before marriage or that it was inherited during marriage, although a 
  relevant factor, can "in the ordinary case . be expected to carry little 
  weight, if any, in a case where the claimant's financial needs cannot be met 
  without recourse to this property": see per Lord Nicholls at page 1583H. That 
  itself does not, necessarily, resolve the problem of distribution in a case 
  where neither party's needs could be satisfied in full, having regard to all 
  the available assets. Whether any preference might be given to the interests 
  of the party bringing assets into the marriage or inheriting them during it 
  would then require attention. But I would expect the joint or partnership 
  aspect of marriage to remain at the forefront of the court's mind. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=157><A name=order157>Case (d)(ii) is potentially different, and the 
  difference appears as the primary explanation of the House of Lords' decision 
  to uphold the Court of Appeal's order in <I>White v White</I>: see per Lord 
  Nicholls at page 1585B note also Lord Cooke at pages 1586F and 1588F-G. At 
  page 1583E-G, Lord Nicholls expounded the relevant principles. He identified 
  the distinction drawn in certain statutory (for example those of Scotland and 
  New Zealand) between inherited property and property owned before marriage, on 
  the one hand, and "matrimonial property" on the other hand, and said: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This distinction is a recognition of the view, widely but not 
    universally held, that property owned by one spouse before the marriage, and 
    inherited property whenever acquired, stand on a different footing from what 
    may loosely be called matrimonial property. According to this view, on a 
    breakdown of the marriage these two classes of property should not 
    necessarily be treated in the same way. Property acquired before marriage 
    and inherited property acquired during marriage come from a source wholly 
    external to the marriage. In fairness, where this property still exists, the 
    spouse to whom it was given should be allowed to keep it. Conversely, the 
    other spouse has a weaker claim to such property than he or she may have 
    regarding matrimonial property.
    <P></P>
    <P>Plainly, when present, this factor is one of the circumstances of the 
    case. ."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=158><A name=order158>This brings me to cases (b) and (c), and to the 
  central issue in a case such as the present. How should property acquired by 
  the efforts of a long-term marriage partner be allocated in the event of the 
  marriage breaking down? In some cases, the accumulation of assets surplus to 
  needs may be the result of special skill and/or effort. In other cases, 
  surplus assets may result without special skill or effort. Some positions are 
  just highly remunerated; and even unsuccessful executives may sometimes 
  receive substantial handshakes. There are of course other cases where even 
  special skill and effort is not especially well remunerated; in those cases 
  however one is back within case (a). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=159><A name=order159>What value should be put on either the 
  accumulation of assets by itself - case (c)? Or its accumulation as a result 
  of the exercise of special skill and effort - case (b)? Where there is no 
  special skill and effort, and where the parties have divided their activities 
  and responsibilities between the domestic and work fronts, it seems to me that 
  the mere accumulation of assets by the husband in the course of his work may 
  quite readily be viewed as a development that should be regarded as being for 
  the joint benefit. The wife has after all done all she could on the domestic 
  front and will herself have foregone the opportunity of producing equivalent 
  assets, as she might ex hypothesis have done if no special skill or effort was 
  required. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=160><A name=order160>Even this, like any simple generalisation, must 
  be viewed with caution in any individual case. There are many perplexing 
  situations that may one day require examination. What, for example, of the 
  individual spouse who each week invests a small part of his or her spare cash 
  in the National Lottery, and one day wins £1 million, or £10 million? Should 
  this asset be viewed like any sudden accretion to the value of the joint home 
  or other matrimonial investment, due to market movements? Or might it, in some 
  circumstances at least, be more analogous to property brought into a marriage 
  or inherited property? Would it for example make any difference, if the other 
  spouse was opposed to all gaming as a waste of money, or if the very limited 
  money expended came from inherited property? There appears to have been a 
  quite extensive jurisprudence in this area in Australia, including <I>Zyk v 
  Zyk</I> (1995) FLC 92-644 (referred to in <I>Lynch v Lynch</I> (Appeals Nos. 
  NA 7 and 15 of 2000) (Full Court of the Family Court of Australia; judgment 
  dated 26<SUP>th</SUP> October 2000), cited to us). In the circumstances there, 
  a husband's lottery win was equated with a contribution by the husband to the 
  joint assets, and the final award, based on the spouses' respective 
  contributions, was tailored accordingly. I mention <I>Zyk v Zyk</I> not to 
  suggest that the same approach to or use of contributions would necessarily 
  apply under the English statute  but simply to illustrate some of the 
  problems and considerations that may one day need to be addressed in this 
  jurisdiction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=161><A name=order161>The exercise of special skill and effort raises 
  yet further and different considerations. I start by recording my conviction 
  that there is no sensible basis for restricting consideration to cases of 
  "stellar contribution", as Miss Baron submitted. Ultimately, there is probably 
  one continuous spectrum, extending from the entirely ordinary to the 
  "stellar". For convenience, it is useful to speak of any acquisition of wealth 
  that is achieved by more than ordinary skill and effort as "special", and I 
  would certainly wish to discourage over-refined analysis of the precise extent 
  to which skill and effort may have been "special". The underlying idea is that 
  a spouse exercising special skill and care has gone beyond what would 
  ordinarily be expected and beyond what the other spouse could ordinarily have 
  hoped to do for himself or herself, had the parties arranged their family 
  lives and activities differently. The first spouse's special skill and effort 
  is special to him or her, and the individual's right to the fruits of an 
  inherent quality of this nature survives as a material consideration despite 
  the partnership or pooling aspect of marriage. For my part, I think that this 
  consideration is a material one to which weight can and should be given in 
  appropriate cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=162><A name=order162>As with property acquired before marriage or by 
  inheritance, I accept that the topic is probably one on which opinions may 
  differ. Miss Baron submits that, to give weight to special skill or efforts 
  would run contrary to the thrust of the House of Lords reasoning in <I>White v 
  White</I>. I do not consider this to be so - and, if stellar contributions are 
  relevant (as Miss Baron would concede) I have already said that I cannot see 
  any sensible basis for excluding lesser, but still extra-ordinary or special 
  contributions. The House of Lords in <I>White v White</I> was concerned to 
  negate any suggestion that a wife who made a domestic contribution should be 
  confined to her "requirements", reasonable or other. It did not decide that 
  equality is the test. It emphasised that equality is a simple tool or check, 
  to be deployed after undertaking the statutory exercise in order to test its 
  result. Nor did the House of Lords decide that inequality of contributions, 
  either to the family welfare or in the acquisition of assets, could have no 
  effect on the ultimate division of assets. Such a rule would itself ignore the 
  language of, in particular, paragraph (f) in s.25(2). The House of Lords' own 
  decision further demonstrates the potential relevance of special factors such 
  as property acquired before the marriage and property inherited. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=163><A name=order163>Miss Baron also referred us to article 7 of 
  Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Spouses shall enjoy equality of rights and responsibilities of 
    a private law character between them, and in their relations with their 
    children, as to marriage, and in the event of its dissolution. This Article 
    shall not prevent states from taking such measures as are necessary in the 
    interests of children."
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=164><A name=order164>She urged that this pointed towards equality in 
  the division of property on divorce. The same argument was advanced in the 
  Appellant's Case which we have seen to the House of Lords in <I>White v 
  White</I>. It received no mention in the judgment. That does not seem to me 
  surprising, for at least the following reasons which I set out to avoid the 
  repetition of the argument elsewhere. First, the Protocol has not (yet at 
  least) even been ratified by the United Kingdom, let alone incorporated into 
  English law. Second, a government's statement (as long ago as 24<SUP>th</SUP> 
  October 1997) that it proposed to ratify subject to first amending English law 
  in respects not presently material cannot show that the government believed 
  that English matrimonial law accepted a principle of equal division of assets 
  on divorce. It clearly did not in 1997 (and still does not under <I>White v 
  White</I>). Thirdly, I think it unlikely that article 5 of Protocol 7 embraces 
  property and its division on divorce at all; elsewhere in the Convention and 
  its Protocols, property is squarely addressed (cf e.g. article 1 of Protocol 
  1, as amended). But, even if this be wrong, a provision requiring "equality of 
  rights and responsibilities of a private law character" in the event of 
  dissolution of a marriage is not the same as a provision prescribing equal 
  division of all assets however acquired, or even of all assets acquired during 
  the marriage. The article could represent no more, at most, than a vague, 
  general aspiration towards "equal" or "fair" treatment, with which <I>White v 
  White</I> would be entirely consistent. Fourthly and finally, we must in any 
  event take English law as stated in <I>White v White</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=165><A name=order165>I am, on the other hand, comforted in my views 
  as to relevance of any special contribution that either spouse may have made 
  to the family's welfare or to the acquisition of assets, by reading the 
  decision of the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in <I>Lynch v 
  Lynch</I> (Appeals Nos. NA 7 and 15 of 2000) (judgment dated 26<SUP>th</SUP> 
  October 2000). The statutory regime there applicable was contained in ss.75 
  and 79 of the Family Law Act 1975 (as amended), which enabled the court to 
  make an order altering property interests if satisfied that, in all the 
  circumstances, it was just and equitable so to do, as well as specifying 
  numerous relevant considerations. I do not think that the relevance of the 
  reasoning is affected by the different and differently worded enumeration of 
  such specific considerations in the Australian statute. As with the English 
  Act, the Australian Act did not indicate the relative weight to be given to 
  different circumstances or how any conflict between opposing considerations 
  should be resolved. The Court cited previous authority (particularly the High 
  Court decision in <I>Mallett v Mallett</I> (1984) 156 CLR 605) in which the 
  difficulty of comparing the fundamentally different activities of breadwinner 
  and homemaker had been identified, together with the risk of undervaluing the 
  role of the homemaker. In <I>Mallett</I> the High Court had gone on to 
  recognise that examination of the performance of both roles might in 
  particular cases demonstrate the carrying out of responsibilities beyond the 
  norm  in the case of a homemaker "as, for example, where homemaker has the 
  responsibility for the home and children for long periods or cases such as the 
  care of a handicapped or special needs child"; or, in the case of a 
  breadwinner, by way of "an outstanding application of time and energy to 
  producing income and the application of what some of the cases have referred 
  to as 'special skills'". The High Court went on to observe: "Within either 
  role there may be cases where the evidence demonstrates a neglect of those 
  responsibilities or a wasting of income or assets. This last aspect is however 
  to be distinguished from any investigation of fault or misconduct". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=166><A name=order166>For my part, I would not wish attempts at 
  detailed examination and invidious comparison of the respective contributions 
  of spouses on the different domestic and business fronts to become 
  commonplace. Even where there is a surplus, any consideration of contributions 
  should be undertaken on a broad basis with the aim of seeing if there was 
  something really special about the skill or effort devoted by either spouse 
  during the marriage. However, I would agree with the Full Court's further 
  conclusions that the determination that a party has made a special 
  contribution "is not necessarily dependant upon the size of the asset pool or 
  the "financial product" achieved by the parties" (paragraph 124), that there 
  are cases "where a "special" contribution may not necessarily result in assets 
  to a value of millions of dollars but which ought nevertheless to be 
  recognised" and that "'special', 'extra' or 'extraordinary' contributions made 
  in the role of homemaker and parent or to the welfare of the family ought to 
  be accorded the same recognition" (paragraph 126). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=167><A name=order167>Later in its judgment, at paragraphs 129-130 
  and 134-138, the Full Court squarely addressed the proposition (cited from the 
  first instance decision in <I>Waters and Jurek</I> (1995) FLC 92-635) that 
  "Homemaker contributions are to be given as much weight as those of the 
  primary breadwinner". It approved the statement of Gibbs CJ in <I>Mallett 
  </I>at 79,120 that any assumption of equality: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"obscures the need to make an evaluation of the respective 
    contributions of the husband and wife by arbitrarily equating the direct 
    financial contribution of one to the indirect contribution of the other 
    homemaker and parent".
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=168><A name=order168>It spoke of a tension between the concepts of 
  recognising "special factors" and of standardising contribution, and approved 
  statements in an extrajudicial paper by Guest J. of 1999 to the effect that 
  the statute required such an evaluation and that a contrary view imposes "a 
  moral duty to share equally regardless of contribution", because of the fact 
  of marriage, denying or at least minimising "the role of exceptional skill and 
  intelligence in the production of wealth" and failing to "validate a 
  recognition of an individual's right to the value of his or her innate skill 
  and intelligence". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=169><A name=order169>My only reservation about these passages would 
  be, to repeat, that they should not encourage attempts at detailed examination 
  and invidious comparison of the respective contributions of spouses on the 
  domestic and business fronts to become commonplace in this jurisdiction. Only 
  where there are special or exceptional circumstances affecting the 
  contribution made on either side should the court be ready to make the 
  comparison, and even then only on a broad basis. But, if and when it is 
  concluded that one spouse has made an exceptional contribution, then the court 
  can and should be prepared to consider its impact on the appropriate order. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Application of principles</B></P>
  <LI value=170><A name=order170>Here, on the judge's findings, it is clear that 
  Mr Cowan's accumulation of wealth over and above any required for the family's 
  needs or to maintain Mr and Mrs Cowan's accustomed standard of living was due 
  to his exercise of special or exceptional skill and efforts. In my view this 
  calls for recognition, when considering what division of assets is 
  appropriate. Although neither party's "reasonable requirements" are any longer 
  part of any test, it seems to me of some interest (at least in this case, 
  where the judge has undertaken the exercise) to bear in mind the rough 
  proportion of the total assets that will be required to maintain their 
  accustomed standard of living. The judge's judgment meant that Mrs Cowan had 
  in total some £3.2 million. Allowing Mr Cowan an equivalent amount, there are 
  surplus assets in excess of £5.1 million. The larger part of any surplus 
  should in my judgment remain with Mr Cowan, by whose exceptional skill and 
  efforts it was earned. Mrs Cowan has some claim on it, by virtue of (a) the 
  long marriage and (b) as a lesser, though not insignificant factor, her wish 
  to have substantial excess assets which she can then take steps to ensure will 
  go to her sons. I would consider it fair, in all the circumstances, to 
  allocate approaching a quarter of this surplus to Mrs Cowan. On this basis, I 
  would increase the sum of £1,775,000 that Singer J. ordered to be paid to 
  £3,000,000. The net effect will be that Mrs Cowan will have (taking into 
  account the value of Hadham Grange and her pension) about £4.4 million, while 
  Mr Cowan will have assets totalling over £7.1 million. In all the 
  circumstances, that broad division also appears to me fair. I would allow the 
  appeal accordingly. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=171><A name=order171>Since writing the first draft of this judgment, 
  I have read with great interest and admiration the judgment of Thorpe LJ which 
  analyses the decision in <I>White v White</I> in a way with which I agree, and 
  looks at the wider picture and the possibility of legislative intervention in 
  terms which clearly merit the closest attention, whether by the Law Commission 
  or by others. </A>
