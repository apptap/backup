  <P><B>Lord Justice Thorpe:</B> </P>
  <P>Introduction</P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>On the 5<SUP>th</SUP> April 2005 Mr Justice Singer 
  handed down judgment in the present case. For the parties it had been a long 
  wait since the trial had commenced on 11<SUP>th</SUP> and concluded on 
  15<SUP>th</SUP> October 2004. Singer J himself granted permission to appeal on 
  14<SUP>th</SUP> April 2005 saying: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I agree that the Court of Appeal should review my decision in 
    this case. The grounds advanced in oral argument …were, in summary: 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the public and professional interest in this, the first 
      post- <I>White </I>big money short marriage case; </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the quantum of the overall award;</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the manner in which I dealt with factual issues concerning 
      the breakdown of the marriage."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>The appeal has certainly generated a good deal of 
  professional interest. Indeed Mr Marks QC for the appellant husband, suggested 
  that there was a string of cases awaiting the outcome of the appeal. However 
  in the end the outcome depends not so much on the resolution of novel points 
  but the familiar assessment of whether the judge's award falls within the 
  generous ambit of discretion and whether its foundations are sound. The 
  foundations in a number of instances are either not expressed or not expressed 
  in much detail. That enabled Mr Marks to suggest that imprecisions were the 
  result of the exceptional lapse of time between hearing and judgment. Mr 
  Mostyn QC for the respondent wife however characterised the judgment as 
  commendably succinct, a virtue that has allowed the judge to express some of 
  his views by nuances. Mr Mostyn's characterisation is apt and Mr Marks was 
  unable to demonstrate that the judgment's long gestation accounted for any 
  obvious errors or omissions. However undoubtedly the appeal has been difficult 
  to decide and most of the difficulties can be ascribed to two shortcomings in 
  the judgment. The first is the failure to make a fuller record and finding of 
  all the facts and circumstances relevant to the exercise of the discretion 
  conferred upon the judge by Section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The 
  second is the judge's failure to explain his ultimate award more fully. His 
  overall award of £5m is achieved by a transfer to the wife of the matrimonial 
  home free of mortgage (agreed value £2.3m) and a capital fund of £2.7m to 
  ensure her relative affluence. Mr Marks suggested, and Mr Mostyn did not 
  demur, that the judge had first decided that the award should be £5m and then 
  that it was reasonable for her to retain the home. The mathematical 
  consequence was that the lump sum should be £2.7m. With that brief overview of 
  what has emerged as the heart of this appeal, I will now record the basic 
  facts. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U><B>The History.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>The husband is English and forty-one years of age. 
  The wife is American and thirty-six years of age. The husband first married in 
  1987, a marriage that was dissolved in 1992. He is an exceptionally successful 
  fund manager. In turn he has worked for Gartmore, Jupiter and New Star. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>The wife arrived in this jurisdiction in February 
  1995 to take up a two-year contract with a pharmaceutical company in 
  Cambridge. The parties met in the summer of 1995 and shortly thereafter 
  commenced an intimate relationship. Between their respective positions there 
  was a considerable financial disparity. The wife had a salary of about £85,000 
  per annum and lived in a rented flat in Cambridge. The husband was a high 
  earner. With Jupiter his annual earnings inclusive of bonus might exceed £1m 
  per annum. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>Perhaps, curiously this intimate relationship, 
  described by Mr Marks as courtship, continued for no less than four years 
  before the couple committed to marriage by their engagement in the summer of 
  1999. Seemingly to avoid the disapproval of her parents, the wife was not 
  prepared to co-habit in advance of marriage. It took place on the 
  14<SUP>th</SUP> July 2000. In preparation, the husband bought the home at 16 
  Elm Park Road in February 2000 for £1.8m. The wife moved to London and to a 
  London job at about that date. In March 2000 the husband received the enormous 
  sum of £20m. This was the second tranche of sums due to him as a result of the 
  sale of Jupiter to Commerzbank completed some five years earlier. The husband 
  has always been closely allied in business to John Duffield. He was the 
  founder of Jupiter and he had recruited the husband from Gartmore. In May 2000 
  Mr Duffield started to invest in New Star and entered into a gentlemen's 
  agreement with the husband to give him a 20% of the venture if and when the 
  husband could be extricated from Commerzbank. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>This objective was achieved on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> 
  January 2001 when the husband left Jupiter to join New Star as it commenced to 
  trade. The husband brought with him from Jupiter three substantial hedge-funds 
  and duly received 200,000 £1 shares in New Star issued at par. As a result of 
  the move, the husband suffered a huge reduction in basic salary but acquired 
  at par 200,000 shares which at the date of their issue were already being 
  placed elsewhere at £80.00 per share. Furthermore, these shares had the 
  obvious potential to rise significantly in value above even that high plane. 
  Although the husband in August 2003 granted an option to Mr Duffield to 
  purchase 75,000 of his shares at £80.00 a share in December 2006, the 
  remaining 125,000 shares hold the potential for further gain. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>In May 2001 the wife gave up her employment. She had 
  developed a considerable interest in interior design, the London home was 
  complete and attention turned to a villa in the south of France offered to the 
  wife on her birthday in June and purchased in joint names in September 2001. 
  Its refurbishment was completed by April 2002. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>The parties had agreed deferring children at the 
  outset of marriage. After all, at that date the wife was only just thirty-one. 
  The husband suggested that she should abandon the contraceptive pill first in 
  Autumn 2001 and again at Christmas. The wife wanted to wait until the work on 
  the villa had been completed. Thus it was that in May she came off the pill 
  and quickly conceived. Sadly in late August she miscarried. Despite every 
  effort, the wife did not conceive again and on the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> April 2003 
  the husband left to pursue his relationship with another woman, whom he has 
  since married. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U><B>The Proceedings.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>Divorce proceedings swiftly followed and within the 
  proceedings the real issue has been money. On the 17<SUP>th</SUP> October 2003 
  District Judge Bowman made a substantial order for maintenance pending suit. 
  Amongst other directions she provided for the simultaneous exchange of 
  narrative affidavits dealing with all relevant Section 25 factors not later 
  than six weeks before the date fixed for the FDR. She also provided that each 
  should answer the other's questionnaire raised on their respective Forms E. I 
  will refer later to the wife's answer to questionnaire and also to the 
  contents of the narrative affidavits. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>Sumner J conducted the FDR hearing on the 
  6<SUP>th</SUP> February 2004. The FDR failed its primary purpose and an order 
  was drawn to prepare the case for trial. The order was preceded by the 
  following recital: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"And upon the respondent declaring that she will not be relying 
    upon Section 25 (2) (g) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in the 
    prosecution of her claim for ancillary relief against the 
  petitioner."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>However paragraph 9 of the order provided for the 
  simultaneous exchange of affidavits in reply to the narrative affidavits filed 
  pursuant to the order of District Judge Bowman. These reply affidavits were 
  duly filed in mid-April. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>The next relevant development was a pre-trial 
  review before the President on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> July 2004. Nothing was then 
  said concerning the wife's promise not to rely upon conduct. However, on the 
  6<SUP>th</SUP> August her solicitors wrote to say that counsel had "come 
  across the only recently reported case of <I>G v G </I>[2004] 1 FLR 1011." 
  They continued by saying that at the trial they intended to rely on <I>G v 
  G</I> "to establish the facts that led to end of the marriage, and as a 
  defensive shield to the reliance that no doubt will be made by your client on 
  the duration of the marriage." </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U><B>The Trial.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>The husband's advisors inevitably regarded this as 
  unprincipled and at the outset of the trial applied to the judge to rule that 
  the wife was bound by her declaration and was, therefore, precluded from 
  asserting that it was the husband's conduct that had destroyed the marriage. 
  The judge refused that application for reasons which he explained in a brief 
  extempore judgment. He emphasised his statutory duty to consider all the 
  circumstances of the case and particularly the criteria in s25(2). He noted 
  that each of the parties had given a lengthy account of the marriage and its 
  breakdown in their narrative affidavits and that the husband was not proposing 
  to withdraw any of his criticisms of the wife. Accordingly, the trial 
  proceeded, each of the parties being in the witness box for about a day. Mr 
  Duffield was called the husband's behalf and each of the parties relied upon a 
  highly qualified forensic accountant to offer an opinion as to the value of 
  the husband's New Star shares. Inevitably the wife's expert advanced the high 
  ground and the husband's the low ground. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>The submissions advanced by counsel were equally 
  polarised. Mr Pointer QC, who then appeared for the husband, submitted that 
  the wife was only entitled to be returned to her former position as a 
  professional woman living in a flat with an income of about £50,000 a year 
  net. Mr Pointer submitted that that could be achieved by allowing her £500,000 
  to purchase a flat and a £120,000 to cover three years of revenue shortfall 
  whilst she worked her way back to her former level. Thus, he urged, the 
  husband's offer of £1.3m was generous. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>Mr Mostyn asserted that as a consequence of the 
  decision in <I>White v White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a>, the proper approach was to 
  calculate the wife's award by reference to the marital acquest, that is to say 
  the increase in the husband's fortune during the period of marriage. The 
  extent of the acquest was much in dispute. Fundamentally, it was argued for 
  the husband that the New Star shares were acquired before the marriage, since 
  they were the subject of the gentlemen's agreement between the husband and Mr 
  Duffield in May 2000. The obvious counter was that since they were not 
  acquired by the husband until January 2001 they were the product of the years 
  of marriage. We may add to that the differences between the wife's accountant 
  (£20m) and the husband's accountant (£14m). From all that disputed territory 
  Mr Mostyn drew his submission that the wife's award should be £7.2m, 
  representing 37.5% of the marital acquest. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>The effect of Singer J's judgment can be broadly 
  summarised as follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>16.1 He accepted the wife's evidence as to the circumstances of 
    the marriage and its breakdown.
    <P></P>
    <P>16.2 He declined either to rule on the difference of opinion between the 
    forensic accountants or to put a value on the New Star shares.</P>
    <P>16.3 He rejected the approach advocated by both Mr Pointer and Mr 
    Mostyn.</P>
    <P>16.4 He held that the wife's half-share of the French villa should go to 
    the husband but that the wife should have the London home valued at 
    £2.3m.</P>
    <P>16.5 He added a lump sum of £2.7m to enable him to conclude his judgment 
    with the following sentence:-</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"A global award equivalent to £5m (plus the furniture and 
      chattels which have agreed) seems to me a fair outcome irrespective of 
      what ever value the husband in due course may achieve for the New Star 
      shares."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><U><B>The Appeal.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>In his grounds of appeal and skeleton argument Mr 
  Marks contended: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>17.1 The judge erred in permitting the wife to adduce evidence 
    as to the cause of the breakdown in the face of her FDR declaration.
    <P></P>
    <P>17.2 The judge erred in holding that the husband was to blame for the 
    breakdown of the marriage and that this consideration shielded the wife from 
    the husband's reliance on the short duration of the marriage.</P>
    <P>17.3 The judge was plainly wrong to justify his substantial award on the 
    ground that the wife had a legitimate expectation that she would live at a 
    higher standard of affluence than she had enjoyed prior to the marriage on a 
    long term basis. </P>
    <P>17.4 The judge wrongly rejected a clear line of authority that 
    established the principle on which claims were to be determined in short 
    marriage cases. In particular he relied upon <I>S v S </I>[1976] FLR 640: 
    <I>H v H </I>[1981] 2 FLR 392: <I>Robertson v Robertson </I>[1983] 4 FLR 387 
    and <I>Hedges v Hedges </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/5.html">[1991] 1</a> FLR 196.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>In his skeleton argument Mr Mostyn had skilfully 
  developed a response to each of the appellant's grounds. However at the 
  conclusion of Mr Marks' submissions he was asked to address only two 
  questions, namely: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) Was the judge's conclusion sufficiently explained and 
        reasoned;</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) Was the judge's overall award plainly 
      excessive?</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>In a succinct oral submission he characterised the 
  judgment as heavily nuanced but submitted that it was possible to construct an 
  adequate and clear rationalisation from a careful analysis of its key 
  paragraphs. From those paragraphs it emerged that the judge was clearly 
  impressed by the wife's commitment to the marriage. Its short duration was 
  neutralised by the combination of that commitment and the wife's comparable 
  innocence in its breakdown. Furthermore the judge had had proper regard to the 
  wife's needs. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>As to the scale of the overall award Mr Mostyn 
  emphasised that it represented something between one sixth and one seventh of 
  the husband's fortune. The product of the marriage was something between £12m 
  and £16m. Taking a middle figure, £5m represented 34% of the marital acquest. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>Finally he submitted that before we could 
  interfere it would not be enough for us to conclude that the judge's reasoning 
  was too attenuated if we were satisfied that the overall award lay within the 
  very wide ambit of his discretion. Only if we concluded that the award was 
  plainly excessive as well as inadequately reasoned could we interfere. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U><B>Conclusions.</B></U></P>
  <P><B><U>The procedural point.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Mr Marks' criticisms are at least superficially 
  well directed. The case of <I>G v G (Financial Provision: Separation 
  Agreement) </I>was decided in this court on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> June 2000 but 
  only reported some four years later. That report clearly led to a major 
  readjustment of the wife's case. In her Form E she had reserved the right to 
  rely on s25 (2)(g). In his questionnaire the husband required her to state her 
  position if she intended to rely on conduct which it would be inequitable for 
  the court to disregard. Her answer of 19<SUP>th</SUP> December 2003 stated: - 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The marriage came to an end at the sole behest of the 
    petitioner who had formed an adulterous relationship with another woman. The 
    respondent says that she is an innocent wife. In such circumstances the 
    petitioner should not be heard to use the argument that "this marriage only 
    lasted a very short time" (<I>Brett v Brett </I>[1969] 1 WLR 
  487)."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>That was, therefore, the case she declared that 
  she had abandoned at the date of the FDR some six weeks later. However, the 
  case revived by her solicitor's letter of the 6<SUP>th</SUP> August was the 
  very same case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>In my judgment that analysis does not carry Mr 
  Marks very far. A retreat from a clear declaration is generally to be 
  deprecated and may in many cases result in a heavy costs penalty. But such a 
  declaration cannot possibly override or circumscribe the trial judge's 
  obligation to investigate whatever he conceives relevant and necessary to 
  enable him to discharge his statutory duty. Ancillary relief proceedings are 
  quasi- inquisitorial and the judge is never confined by what the parties elect 
  to put in evidence or by whatever they may agree to exclude from evidence. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>Singer J was indisputably right to rule as he did 
  on 11<SUP>th</SUP> October, particularly given that the declaration had to be 
  weighed in the context of the contentious affidavits filed by the parties both 
  before and after the making of the declaration. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>Mr Marks sought to meet that difficulty by 
  asserting that as a matter of principle and construction allegations of 
  conduct in ancillary relief could only be advanced under s25(2)(g) and if that 
  sub-section was excluded by agreement or concession then conduct could not be 
  introduced as an aspect of any other of the statutory criteria. Thus it was 
  not open to a party to disavow s25(2)(g) and then contend that the other 
  spouse's contribution, which s25 (2)(f) requires the court to assess, was 
  valueless or devalued because of attitude or conduct. In support of this 
  submission he relied upon the case of <I>Wells v Wells</I> only reported at 
  first instance in a note at [2001] <I>Family Law</I> 656. The note could be 
  read to record a conclusion that where a party alleges that the other has made 
  a nil contribution to the welfare of the family the case must be advanced 
  under s25(2)(g). However the note is ambiguous and without the judgment itself 
  it is pointless to consider that authority further. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>Mr Marks further submitted that it was not open to 
  an applicant to finesse the other party's reliance on the short duration of 
  the marriage by asserting that the breakdown was the consequence of the 
  other's conduct. That case could only be mounted under s25(2) (g), as the wife 
  had here correctly recognised by her response to questionnaire. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>Mr Marks contended that were we to hold otherwise, 
  we would be flouting the principle established in the seminal case of 
  <I>Wachtel v Wachtel</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../1973/10.html">[1973] Fam 72</a> and opening the floodgates to ancillary 
  relief trials that would be akin to the bitter defended divorce that 
  flourished prior to the Divorce Reform Act 1969. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>These submissions cannot be right in my judgment. 
  The statutory criteria are not to be rigidly characterised. The judge has an 
  overriding obligation to regard and to reflect in his judgment "all the 
  circumstances of the case". In my judgment the language of s25(2)(g) is 
  intended to discourage allegations of conduct unless it is such that it would 
  be inequitable to disregard. In other words it is pointless, and in terms of 
  costs, risky, to assert misconduct that does not measure high on the scale of 
  gravity. But conduct that would not merit advancing under s25(2)(g) is not 
  therefore irrelevant or inadmissible. Often the court's assessment of the 
  worth of the comparable contributions will require consideration of motives, 
  attitudes, commitments and responsibilities. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>As to the relevance of those factors in assessing 
  the significance to be attached to the duration of the marriage, the proper 
  approach is already settled by my judgment in the case of <I>G v G</I> with 
  which the President and Wright J agreed. In presenting his appeal Mr Pointer 
  criticised Connell J. for effectively relying on the husband's misconduct as a 
  counter-balancing factor to the brevity of the marriage. My response to that 
  submission is expressed in paragraph 34 of the judgment when I said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"A judge has to do fairness between the parties, having regard 
    to all the circumstances. He must be free to include within that 
    discretionary review the factors which compelled the wife to terminate the 
    marriage as she did. The point was essentially taken as a defensive shield 
    to the reliance upon the duration submission. There must surely be room for 
    the exercise of a judicial discretion between the pole of a wife who is 
    driven to petition by the husband's unfeeling misconduct and that of a wife 
    who exits from a marriage capriciously and for her own advantage. It seems 
    to me that the judge was doing no more than taking his bearings as to where 
    he stood along that path."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>That passage seems to me to be fatal to Mr Marks' 
  submission. He sought to distinguish the case by asserting that there the 
  wife's case at trial had been both presented and found to be conduct 
  inequitable to disregard within the meaning of s25(2)(g). The judgment of 
  Connell J in the Family Division was contemporaneously reported at [2000] 2 
  FLR 18. I do not consider that Connell J did so find. Further even had he done 
  so I would not consider the distinction that Mr Marks seeks to draw as valid. 
  On this aspect Singer J directed himself by reference to the decision of this 
  court in <I>G v G </I>and he was clearly right so to do. Having seen and heard 
  the parties extensively cross-examined he was plainly entitled to conclude 
  that the husband was to blame for the breakdown of the marriage. That finding 
  entitled him to give much less weight to the duration of the marriage than he 
  would have done had he found that the wife was to blame for its breakdown or 
  that the parties had separated consensually each acknowledging unexpected 
  incompatibility. Those conclusions lead to the rejection of Mr Marks' first 
  and second grounds. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U><B>Principles.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>It is now convenient to consider Mr Marks' fourth 
  ground in which he vigorously but vainly sought to argue that cases largely 
  decided about twenty-five years ago settled the principle to be applied in 
  determining claims arising out of brief marriages. The principle drawn from 
  those early cases was that the award should be enough to get the unhappy 
  applicant back on her feet. I think that characterisation is probably drawn 
  from the judgment of Balcombe J in <I>Robertson v Robertson </I>when at 392 he 
  said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I also order a lump payment of £15,000 which seems to me more 
    than adequate to enable the wife to get on her feet again."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>There are a number of very good reasons why that 
  should no longer be the modern approach. First, it originated and developed 
  during long years in which the yardstick for measuring the extent of the 
  applicant's claim was an assessment of her reasonable requirements. Second, a 
  marriage is not to be equated to a purely financial venture where the court 
  may redress breach of contract or the disintegration of a partnership by an 
  award of damages or other financial relief. Section 25 requires a more 
  sophisticated evaluation of the extent of the wife's commitment to and 
  investment in the marriage emotionally and psychologically. In some cases it 
  may be necessary for the court to assess emotional and psychological damage 
  and the extent to which the applicant's future capacity and opportunity to 
  enter into a fulfilling family life has been blighted. What a party has given 
  to a marriage and what a party has lost on its failure cannot be measured by 
  simply counting the days of its duration. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>Third, Mr Marks' reliance on the old cases is 
  clearly precluded by the decision of this court in <I>Foster v Foster</I> 
  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/565.html">[2003] 2 FLR 299</a>. Between that case and the present there is an obvious 
  similarity in that the duration of each was approximately 2¾ years. In other 
  respects, the cases are clearly distinguishable. In <I>Foster </I>the means of 
  the parties were comparatively modest, the assets being approximately 
  £400,000. Furthermore, during the marriage each had contributed to property 
  dealing and development which had proved profitable. The wife had made the 
  greater financial contribution to the dealing. The district judge decided to 
  return to each what he or she had brought into the marriage as well as such 
  post-separation contributions as he or she had made. The profits made during 
  the marriage were to be divided equally between the parties. The result of 
  that exercise left the wife with approximately 61% and the husband 39%. The 
  wife appealed successfully to the circuit judge who increased her share to 
  70%. The husband's appeal succeeded and this court restored the order of the 
  district judge. Since it was a second appeal caught by the provision of 
  Section 55 of the Access to Justice Act 1998 this court could not grant 
  permission unless the husband demonstrated an important point of principle or 
  practice or some other compelling reason. Hale LJ explained that the husband 
  had cleared that hurdle thus: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"in our view the case does raise the important issue of the 
    proper approach, in the light of <I>White v White</I> and later decisions of 
    this court, to the parties respective contributions in a short childless 
    marriage where both are working. Accordingly we gave permission to 
  appeal."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>Accordingly, in her judgment Hale LJ considered 
  the impact of the decisions in <I>White v White</I>, <I>Cowan v Cowan 
  </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../2001/679.html">[2002] FAM 97</a> and <I>Lambert v Lambert</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../2002/1685.html">[2003] 1FLR 139</a>. Counsel for 
  the wife argued that those authorities were solely concerned with the problem 
  of evaluating the very different contributions of breadwinner and homemaker 
  over a long marriage where there have been children to bring up. They were of 
  no relevance to a short, childless marriage where both parties had been 
  working. Lady Justice Hale rejected that submission emphatically. In paragraph 
  19 she recorded counsel's eventual concession that where a substantial surplus 
  had been generated by joint efforts it could not matter whether they had taken 
  a short or long time to do so. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=36><A name=para36>Although the facts of that case are very different 
  and although much of the judgment is directed to the features of the 
  particular case, it is clear that Hale LJ was signalling a fresh approach to 
  measuring of awards in cases involving marriage of short duration. In my 
  opinion, she says so expressly in the passages to which I have referred. 
  Furthermore, she underlines that implicitly by omitting any reference to the 
  old cases, cases which would of course have been very familiar to her. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><U><B>The Award.</B></U></P>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>That leaves for consideration the husband's third 
  ground, the only ground which in my judgment held substantial prospects of 
  success. Was the judge right to found his award on the wife's legitimate 
  expectation? Was his award plainly excessive? To answer these questions 
  requires a careful analysis of the judgment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>The judge's explanation for the end result is by 
  no means straightforward or clear. The case was extremely hard fought by the 
  best available professionals on both sides. At its conclusion the husband was 
  surely entitled to a clear explanation as to why the judge had opted for an 
  award much closer to the submission of Mr Mostyn. Mr Mostyn effectively 
  conceded the absence of a clear and simple explanation when he described the 
  judgment, with customary advocacy, as heavily nuanced. I have read and re-read 
  the judgment in a search for its true ratio. In the end I think that it can be 
  discerned from the following significant paragraphs taken in combination. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>First, in paragraph 48 the judge explains his 
  rejection of the old yardstick: what is required to get the wife on her feet. 
  In paragraph 48 he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I can therefore accept that there may be cases - relatively 
    extreme cases - where such an approach would remain valid. But I am 
    satisfied that it would not be fair to apply it in this case. For what it 
    ignores is the key element to my mind present here. That is that by virtue 
    of this marriage, taken in its proper setting both in terms of the way it 
    was reached and the way it ended, H gave W a legitimate expectation that she 
    would on a long-term basis be living on a higher economic plane that the 
    rented flat and her £85,000 p.a. job had afforded her when she left them to 
    live with him as his wife at the house he bought for that purpose. It would 
    in my judgment quite simply be unfair to take the view as submitted by Mr 
    Pointer that £500,000 for the purchase of a flat and £120,000 to cover 3 
    years of revenue shortfall until she could recoup her position in her 
    specialist field would be adequate, and thus that H's £1.3M offer is very 
    generous."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>This paragraph reveals that the decisive factor 
  for the judge was that the marriage, taken in its full context, gave the wife 
  a legitimate entitlement to a long term future on a higher plane of affluence 
  than she had enjoyed prior to marriage. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>This then recurs in paragraphs 64 and 65 when the 
  judge said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This then as it appears to me is one of what may be a rare 
    group of cases where the attempt to measure what the yardstick of equality 
    should be set against is to beat the air or to hunt a chimera. The game is 
    simply not worth the very uncertain and extremely expensive candle. Fairness 
    can be better achieved, in my view, by carrying out the discretionary 
    exercise ordained by the statute in recognition of all the relevant factors. 
    Amongst those the short duration of the marriage, set in the context of its 
    factual matrix as I have attempted to do, is undoubtedly very significant. 
    Of course I must strive to avoid a discriminatory approach based on outmoded 
    concepts of differential financial and non-financial contributions. I must 
    reflect what I believe is that modern approach by not limiting the award to 
    an amount which will put this wife back where she was or which will, rather 
    patronisingly, put her back on her feet.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Rather, as it seems to me, the award should recognise that H has 
    by this marriage, notwithstanding its short duration, given W a reasonable 
    expectation that her life as once again a single woman need not revert to 
    what it was before her marriage, and that she should be able to live at a 
    significantly better standard in terms of accommodation and spendable 
    income, even if at one which does not approach the level that H can afford 
    for himself and his new family."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>Whilst I accept that in the context of this case 
  the judge was entitled to regard as "the key element" the wife's "legitimate 
  expectation" of living to a higher standard as the ex-wife of Mr Miller, I 
  emphasise that it is a fact-dependent conclusion and it is not to be elevated 
  into a principle or yardstick filling a vacuum created by the rejection of the 
  restitutionary objective sought in the old cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>Now it is necessary to cite in full the concluding 
  four paragraphs under the sub-heading "The Award": - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"My conclusion is that W should have the opportunity to retain 
    the former matrimonial home for as long as she chooses to live in it. 
    Subject to any adjustment to the form of the order to accommodate her 
    potential exposure to US tax I intend that it should be transferred to her 
    free of mortgage. That will involve H paying off the liability of about 
    £500,000 secured on it or adding it to the lump sum payment to enable W to 
    redeem it herself. The value of that property after deduction of notional 
    sale costs has been taken as about £2.3M. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In addition a fair outcome to this case is that H will pay W a 
    lump sum of a further £2.7M. If the <B>Duxbury </B>methodology is taken 
    simply as a guide then the computer programme <B><I>Capitalise 
    </B></I>suggests that for a woman soon to be 36 a fund utilised in 
    accordance with usual principles would generate an initial annual net income 
    of about £98,000. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>That is very significantly less than the budget of well over 
    £200,000 which W asserted was the sum of the costs met by H in the last year 
    of cohabitation, suitably trimmed to reflect his departure. She will not be 
    able to afford that standard, but with an income of that order plus whatever 
    she can earn she will be able to live to a very tolerable standard in that 
    house.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>A global award equivalent to £5M (plus the furniture and 
    chattels which have been agreed) seems to me a fair outcome irrespective of 
    whatever value H in due course may achieve for the New Star 
  shares."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>It is possible to elaborate on the factors that 
  emerged in those crucial paragraphs from the judge's earlier findings. First, 
  as to "The Way (the marriage) was reached", the judge in paragraphs 27 – 32 
  considered what weight should be given to the five years of intimate 
  relationship immediately preceding the marriage. Essentially, he adopted the 
  middle way. In paragraph 29 he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This rather tentative relationship, at least on H's part, until 
    their engagement does not fit entirely happily to my mind with the epithets 
    'exclusive' and 'committed' which Mr Mostyn invites me to apply. But it was 
    certainly several grades more significant than H's rather dismissive 
    description of it as one merely of 'girlfriend and boyfriend'."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>Then in paragraph 32 he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Into the balancing exercise I will put the fact as I find that 
    there was no mutual commitment to make their lives together until their 
    engagement in July 1999. Until then their ties were tentative and their 
    separate expectations did not accord. In this relationship there was no 
    pre-engagement honeymoon to blend seamlessly into marriage. I tend therefore 
    to favour Mr Pointer's submissions and treat this a marriage of relatively 
    short duration."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>As to "the way (the marriage) ended", the judge 
  left the middle ground to accept the wife's case. His essential findings are 
  in paragraphs 37 and 38 when he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This marriage may well have been doomed, but my conclusions as 
    an analysis of the explanations that I heard from both of them are these. H 
    may well have developed an irritation with aspects of W's personality and 
    behaviour. This reflects more his lack of adaptability than any shortcomings 
    on her part. The sum of what he complains of is not marriage-breaking stuff. 
    I do not subscribe to his view that his burgeoning relationship with the 
    woman with whom he lives was a consequence rather than a cause of the 
    breakdown.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>None of this, to state the obvious, is conduct which it would be 
    inequitable to disregard in arriving at a resolution of the financial 
    dispute. But it has the result that it would be unfair to W to concentrate 
    solely on the bare chronology of this marriage without acknowledging that 
    she did not seek to end it nor did she give H any remotely sufficient reason 
    for him to do so."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>In relation to their respective contributions, the 
  judge's findings were again favourable to the wife. In considering their rival 
  claims to the French villa he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I have no doubt the wife is right that she was far more 
    absorbed in the grand scheme as well as the minutiae of the properties 
    conversion…".</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>His overall conclusion is clear from paragraph 43 
  in which he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"W's contributions to their family life were non-financial (save 
    to the extent that she worked at the start of the marriage). She aspired to 
    provide, as I have said, the domestic and social fabric in which they could 
    both enjoy the fruits of H's success and the opportunities for leisure, 
    relaxation and enjoyment which were available. A major contribution in this 
    context was the planning and oversight she brought to the refurbishment, 
    equipping and furnishing of the French property to which H has become so 
    attached. Neither the modest period during which she was able to make this 
    contribution nor the very considerable scale of H's efforts and the rewards 
    they brought him affect the proposition, which I accept, that 
    incommensurable though these contributions are as chalk and cheese, 
    nevertheless no discriminatory attitude should be allowed to treat them as 
    other than equivalent."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>Amplification of the paragraphs explaining the 
  award is also capable of extraction from earlier paragraphs. As to the 
  transfer of the former matrimonial home, a glancing reference in paragraph 40 
  reveals that her objective in seeking to retain it was in part to use its 
  extra space as an office for her projected future consultancy in interior 
  design. It must also be balanced against 26, the paragraph in which the judge 
  concluded that the fairer outcome was for the husband to have the outright 
  ownership of the second home. Although there is no description of the 
  matrimonial home in the judgment, during the course of argument we were shown 
  the particulars prepared in the sale to the husband which demonstrate that it 
  is a comparatively modest property with three bedrooms on four floors. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>As to the judge's seeming reliance on the Duxbury 
  methodology in paragraph 71, he had earlier stated in paragraph 40: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Although I shall refer as a point of reference only to a 
    Duxbury calculation I do not propose to decide the case upon the basis of 
    any strict or even tangential reliance upon that to fix the 
  award…".</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=51><A name=para51>The reference to the wife's earning capacity in 
  paragraph 72 is apt, given that the judge had found in paragraph 40: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"But that she has and should exercise an earning capacity given 
    her age and aptitude is incontestable, and I take it into account as one of 
    the factors of the case. "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=52><A name=para52>The reference in the final paragraph to "whatever 
  value the husband in due course may achieve for the New Star shares" is in, my 
  judgment, significant. In his initial outline of the case the judge recorded 
  the prospect of future sale of the New Star shares which might, subject to 
  clearing a number of hurdles, "net him something of the order of £24.44m. 
  There is another reference in paragraph 41 when the judge said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In addition there is a good likelihood that at some stage the 
    potential of his shares will be unleashed."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=53><A name=para53>It is easy and superficial to characterise this as 
  a pay-off of £5m for a mere 2¾ years of marriage. In my judgment the reality 
  is very different. Although the judge did not attach much weight to the four 
  years preceding engagement, the fact is that at the age of twenty-six the 
  applicant committed herself to this man. The judge's findings show that during 
  that period ambivalence was all on the husband's side. In paragraph 28 he 
  wrote: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Until (the engagement) the wife was hoping to marry the husband 
    with more enthusiasm than he was demonstrating for that commitment, in my 
    judgment."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>On engagement she moved to London and found fresh 
  employment. At the outset of the marriage, she worked to ensure the emergence 
  of a primary home and a holiday home fit for his status as a leader in his 
  chosen field. Once that was achieved, she tried for a family. The 
  responsibility for the collapse of that endeavour must in part be ascribed to 
  the husband's decision to end the marriage. Finally it must not be forgotten 
  that the net value of the award is in reality £4.5m given the judge's decision 
  that the wife's half share in the villa was to go to the husband. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>On that analysis, my ultimate conclusion is that 
  the judge's award was both sufficiently if obliquely explained and that it 
  cannot be labelled plainly excessive. In my judgment, it lies at the top end 
  of the permissible bracket. Had I been sitting at first instance, I do not 
  think that I would have gone so high. However, I would emphasise that the 
  facts and circumstances of the case are highly unusual. The ambit of the 
  judge's discretion in cases involving very large assets and a short childless 
  marriage is particularly wide. Furthermore Mr Mostyn rightly reminded us of 
  the words of Lord Hoffman in <I>Piglowska v Piglowska</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/27.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/27.html">[1999] 1 WLR 1360</a></A> 
  HL when he said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"First, the appellate court must bear in mind the advantage 
    which the first instance judge had in seeing the parties and the other 
    witnesses. This is well understood on questions of credibility and findings 
    of primary fact. But it goes further than that. It applies also to the 
    judge's evaluation of those facts. If I may quote what I said in <I>Biogen 
    Inc. v. Medeva Plc</I>. <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/18.html">[1997] RPC 1</a>,45:</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The need for appellate caution in reversing the trial judge's 
    evaluation of the facts is based upon much more solid grounds than 
    professional courtesy. It is because specific findings of fact, even by the 
    most meticulous judge, are inherently an incomplete statement of the 
    impression which was made upon him by the primary evidence. His expressed 
    findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, 
    relative weight, minor qualification and nuance… of which time and language 
    do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the 
    judge's overall evaluation."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The second point follows from the first. The exigencies of daily 
    court room life are such that reasons for judgment will always be capable of 
    having been better expressed. This is particularly true of an unreserved 
    judgment such as the judge gave in this case but also of a reserved judgment 
    based upon notes, such as was given by the district judge. These reasons 
    should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the 
    contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which 
    matters he should take into account. This is particularly true when the 
    matters in question are so well known as those specified in section 25(2). 
    An appellate court should resist the temptation to subvert the principle 
    that they should not substitute their own discretion for that of the judge 
    by a narrow textual analysis which enables them to claim that he misdirected 
    himself."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>Although I have not found this an easy appeal, in 
  the end I am firm in my conclusion that it must be dismissed. My judgment may

  out. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Lord Justice Wall:</B></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>I agree. Like Thorpe LJ, whose judgment I have had

  reasoning process; and (b) that the award is not so excessive as to be outside

  devoted so much of both his skeleton argument and his oral submissions to his 
  first two grounds of appeal. These were: (1) that the judge erred in the 
  exercise of his discretion by permitting Mrs. Miller to adduce evidence as to 
  the alleged cause of the breakdown of the parties' relationship, despite the 
  parties having previously agreed that Mrs. Miller would not be relying on any 
  allegation of conduct which it would be inequitable for the court to 
  disregard; and (2) that by conducting "an inquisition into which party was 
  more to blame for the breakdown of the relationship", and by finding that Mr. 
  Miller's "fault in the divorce represented a shield to the assertion that this 
  was a short marriage case", the judge conducted an exercise which was "outside 
  his discretion, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA 1973) having proscribed 
  inquiry into the fault behind divorce save where there was conduct by one 
  party which was such that it would be inequitable fort he court to disregard 
  it". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>In my judgment, these are bad points, for all the 
  reasons Thorpe LJ gives in paragraphs 22 to 31 of his judgment. I was equally 
  unimpressed by Mr. Marks' deployment of the "floodgates" argument, expressed 
  in his skeleton, in the following way: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The court should not attempt to step into the shoes of one man 
    and say that the straw that broke the camel's back in the relationship with 
    his wife would not have broken the back of the court were the court in that 
    relationship with that wife. Civil and criminal law dictate that you must 
    take a man as you find him. The Family Division, however, pursuant to this 
    judgment, must hereafter apply the test of an objective bystander in 
    assessing where the fault for marital breakdown life. The objective 
    bystander, in this case the judge, stands loftily over the relationship and 
    imposes his own moral perception of right and wrong in the midst of the 
    enormous emotional upset of a marital breakdown."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=60><A name=para60>I recognise in this passage neither what Singer J 
  did, nor what judges in short marriage cases will be required to do in the 
  future. Nor do I agree with Mr. Marks when he asserts of the judge: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"His view, set out over five short paragraphs of his judgment, 
    attributes fault to the husband. Necessarily, that judgment is wholly flawed 
    given the complexities of the human relationship, and is an exercise upon 
    which he should never have embarked. "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Limited examination of the parties in cross-examination can only 
    have provided the judge with the most superficial perspective of the parties 
    and their marriage. Despite the obviously limited scope of the enquiry, the 
    learned judge considered himself able to point the finger of blame for the 
    breakdown of the relationship at the husband.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=61><A name=para61>The extravagance of Mr. Marks' rhetoric can, I 
  think, be tested both by what Singer J found, and how he went about it. In the 
  first place, he was plainly right, in my judgment, to follow and apply 
  paragraphs 32 to 34 of Thorpe LJ's judgment in <I>G v G (Financial Provision: 
  Separation Agreement)</I> [2004] 1 FLR 1011, paragraph 34 of which Thorpe LJ 
  has set out in paragraph 30 of his judgment in the instant case, and which I 
  will not repeat. I find it, however, an entirely accurate analysis of how a 
  judge exercises a proper judicial discretion when dealing with section 
  25(2)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA 1973) in a short marriage 
  case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=62><A name=para62>Secondly, an important factor for the judge (and 
  manifestly one of the circumstances of the case) was Mrs. Miller's commitment 
  to the marriage. We know that Mrs. Miller miscarried in August 2002. In 
  paragraph 36 of his judgment, Singer J said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Until only a few months before their separation these spouses 
    were both hoping to have a child. He disengaged from that process at a time 
    when he may well have sensed at least the beginnings of the relationship 
    that led him to leave (her). "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=63><A name=para63>The issue was not complex. Part of Mrs. Miller's 
  case, as found by the judge, was that the breakdown of the marriage was 
  "largely if not entirely attributable to an intimate relationship H formed 
  with the woman with whom he now lives, the physical separation having occurred 
  the day after he revealed the association" to his wife. The judge had taken 
  the view that: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"….. W's evidence could not be circumscribed as to preclude her 
    from airing this issue without which it would be impossible to gauge the 
    strength and impact of the catalogue of complaints about her conduct during 
    cohabitation advanced by H to seek to justify (as I find was his intention) 
    his decision that the marriage had no future and /or to dilute what W 
    asserts was the destructive impact of his adultery. His case is clear: he 
    maintains that his new association was a consequence of an unhappy marriage 
    rather than a cause of its breakdown."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=64><A name=para64>Moreover, the investigation had proved valuable. 
  The judge commented: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I do as a result of hearing this evidence regard myself as 
    better able to position myself fairly in relation to W's claims than 
    otherwise would have been the case. I am moreover satisfied that H was not 
    put at a disadvantage by this ruling. W did not seek to go beyond what she 
    had already said on the topic in her affidavit evidence. I do not believe 
    that H's case on these issues would have been improved by any more intensive 
    preparation than had already be devoted to it "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=65><A name=para65>It is to be noted that the judge embarked on this 
  fact finding exercise by reference to the particular facts of the case. This 
  is, of course, what the profession would call a "big money / short marriage" 
  case. On the particular facts of this case, the reasons for the breakdown of 
  the marriage were relevant. That does not mean that they will be relevant in 
  every case, nor does it mean that, if they are, there will need to be a 
  disproportionate amount of time and costs spent investigating them. In this 
  respect I agree with and adopt the following passage from Mr. Mostyn's and Ms 
  Bailey-Harris' skeleton argument: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"49.16 Mr Marks raises the spectre of Pandora's Box if the route 
    that Singer J took is allowed to stand. He says that if the judgment is 
    approved there would be merit in undertaking that assessment in every case. 
    He says that it would open the floodgates to an inquiry that has been dead 
    for 30 years. He says that an <I>"inevitable consequence would be the 
    rebirth of the defended divorce".</I> This is all so much 
  rhetoric."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>49.17 In the vast majority of cases established principles will 
    guide the court to its conclusion without any need for consideration to be 
    given to the reasons for the breakdown of the marriage. In all cases where 
    the assets are insubstantial the predominant criterion will be the parties' 
    respective needs, principally for accommodation. In a long marriage case, 
    where the assets are substantial, and where they have been built up during 
    the marriage, the result will almost invariably be an equal division. In a 
    medium length marriage, where the assets are substantial, there may be a 
    modest departure from equality to reflect the principle that a domestic 
    contribution is an accrual over time. In a short marriage case, where there 
    are children and where the assets are substantial, amongst the s 25 
    considerations the court will give particular recognition to the needs of 
    the wife as the primary carer and to her future contributions in that role. 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>49.18 The court is only likely to entertain evidence and 
    argument as to the reason for the breakdown of the marriage in a tiny 
    handful of cases, where the marriage is short and childless, and where the 
    assets are substantial, so much so that it can be said that the order that 
    fairness requires can be met without impinging on the payer's needs. 
    Moreover the judge is only likely to entertain evidence as to the cause of 
    the breakdown of a marriage (in a case where S25 (2)(g) conduct is 
    <U>not</U> pleaded) where, as here, one party not only relies strongly on 
    the durational argument but also unjustifiably blames the other party for 
    the breakdown in circumstances where his own hands are not clean. In the 
    majority of short childless big money marriages the court will recognise, 
    and the parties will accept, that the failure is a mutual misfortune where 
    attribution of blame simply does not arise. In such cases there are no <I>G 
    v G</I> poles within which the judge can align himself. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>49.19 It can therefore be seen the spectre of floodgates is 
    misconceived. The facts of this case were exceptional, as they were in <I>G 
    v G</I>.<B> </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>49.20 In this case the parties had set out their cases as to the 
    reason for the failure of the marriage in their affidavits. They were 
    shortly cross-examined on the topic. H did not instruct Mr Pointer to hold 
    back in his cross-examination of W. Having read and heard the evidence 
    Singer J was able to make the finding that was blindingly obvious to anyone 
    who had attended the trial (Paragraph 37): </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>'The sum of what he complains of is not marriage-breaking stuff. 
    I do not subscribe to his view that his burgeoning relationship with the 
    woman with whom he lives was a consequence rather than a cause of the 
    breakdown.'"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=66><A name=para66>Finally, in relation to these two grounds of 
  appeal, Singer J saw each of the parties in the witness box for a day. I 
  entirely reject Mr. Marks' submission that for an experienced and perceptive 
  judge of the Family Division this "provided the judge with the most 
  superficial perspective of the parties and their marriage". As the passages 
  which I have cited clearly demonstrates, the judge said the investigation had 
  helped him. I am no doubt at all that it did. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=67><A name=para67>In my judgment, Mr. Marks had two powerful 
  arguments, both capable of very simple expression. The first was that the 
  judge had simply not explained himself. The second was that the award was so 
  large that, in the absence of a proper rationalisation, it was simply outside 
  the band of reasonable decisions, and must, accordingly, be plainly wrong. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=68><A name=para68>I acknowledge that, in my initial reading of the 
  judgment, I was struck by the first point. This led me to think that the 
  judge, highly experienced as he is in "big money" cases, may have stepped 
  "outside the band" in awarding Mrs. Miller a total of £5 m. On the one hand, 
  the judge had, rightly in my view, rejected the "needs" approach identified in 
  the pre <I>White v. White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a> (<I>White</I>) cases. He had, 
  equally rightly in my view, rejected Mr. Mostyn's "matrimonial acquest" 
  approach. He had, again rightly, attempted to achieve fairness, and avoid 
  discrimination by "carrying out the discretionary exercise ordained by the 
  statute in recognition of all the relevant factors". But what were the 
  relevant factors? And how had he balanced them? These are not questions to 
  which there are answers which stand out from the judgment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=69><A name=para69>And how had he arrived at £5 m? He had plainly 
  decided that Mrs. Miller should be entitled to retain the former matrimonial 
  home, and should give up her share in the French property. But those factors, 
  as Mr. Mostyn was minded to concede only explain how he got to the lump sum of 
  £2.7 m. A judgment should tell the parties before the court why they have won 
  or lost. Mr. Miller is entitled to know why he has to write a cheque for £5 m 
  as opposed to some lesser amount. In my judgment, he has a reasonable 
  complaint when the answer has to be teased out of the judgment by nuance, or 
  when the judgment is skilfully unpicked and then repackaged by Mr. Mostyn. 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=70><A name=para70>However, before turning to the judgment, the first 
  question one has to ask, I think, is whether, as Mr. Marks submitted, the line 
  of pre-<I>White </I>short marriage cases such as <I>S v S</I> [1977] Fam 127, 
  <I>Robertson v Robertson</I> (1983) 4 FLR 387 and <I>Attar v Attar (No 2)</I> 
  [1985] FLR 653 remain good law. I am in no doubt at all that the answer to 
  that question is "no", and that the approach adopted in those decisions, both 
  at first instance and in this court, cannot survive in the light of the 
  decision of the House of Lords in <I>White</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=71><A name=para71>I am reinforced in that conclusion by the decision 
  of this court in <I>Foster v Foster</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/565.html">[2003] 2 FLR 299</a> in which Hale LJ, 
  giving the leading judgment, plainly applied the principles identified in 
  <I>White </I>in a short marriage case. This is part of what she said: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"[14] As Thorpe LJ also said in<I> Cordle</I>, at para 34, the 
    only universal rule is to apply the criteria in s 25(2) of the Matrimonial 
    Causes Act 1973 to all the circumstances of the case (giving first 
    consideration to the welfare of any minor children) and to arrive at a fair 
    result that avoids discrimination. In<I> White v White</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/54.html">[2001] 1 AC 596</a>, 
    at pp 599-600, 603-606, Lord Nicholls explained that Parliament has declined 
    to lay down any rules; it has given the courts a wide discretion to take 
    account of all the relevant circumstances of the case; it has even repealed 
    the original statutory objective of seeking to place the parties in the 
    position in which they would have been had the marriage not broken down. 
    Implicitly, the objective must be to achieve a fair outcome and there could 
    be no presumption or starting point of equality of distribution. However, 
    having conducted the statutory exercise,"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"a judge would always be well advised to check his tentative 
    views against the yardstick of equality of division. As a general guide, 
    equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is 
    good reason to do so. The need to consider and articulate reasons for 
    departing from equality would help the parties and the court to focus on the 
    need to ensure the absence of discrimination." (p 605)</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>[15] He also pointed out (p 605) that in seeking to achieve a 
    fair outcome there was no room for discrimination between husband and wife 
    and their respective roles. Whatever the division of labour chosen by the 
    husband and wife, or forced upon them by circumstances, fairness requires 
    that this should not prejudice or advantage either party when considering 
    their respective contributions for the purpose of s 25(2)(f) of the 1973 
    Act. Section 25(2)(f) refers to the contribution which each has made to the 
    welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the 
    home or caring for the family. If in their different spheres each 
    contributed equally to the family, then in principle it matters not which of 
    them earned the money and built up the assets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>[16]<I> White</I> concerned a long marriage in which both 
    parties had been engaged in breadwinning as well as homemaking and 
    childrearing. The principle has recently been reaffirmed by this court in<I> 
    Lambert v Lambert</I> <A 
    href="../2002/1685.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../2002/1685.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 1685</a></A>, <A

    it was unacceptable to place a greater value on the contribution of the 
    breadwinner than that of the homemaker as a justification for dividing the 
    product of the breadwinner's efforts unequally (although of course there 
    might be other reasons for doing so, such as a disparity in the parties' 
    needs).</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>[17] Miss Boyd, on behalf of the wife, however, argues that 
    these cases were concerned with the problem of evaluating the very different 
    contributions of breadwinner and homemaker over a long marriage where there 
    have been children to bring up. They are of no relevance to a short 
    childless marriage where both parties have been working. The court has to 
    consider the duration of the marriage under s 25(2)(d). Here the only 
    contributions to be considered under s 25(2)(f) are those in money or 
    money's worth and so the court is entitled to take account of the fact that 
    one has contributed more than the other.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>[18] This is a surprising proposition ………"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=72><A name=para72><I>Foster v Foster</I> was a case in which wealth 
  had been accumulated during the marriage by the joint efforts of both husband 
  and wife. The district judge decided, accordingly, that the right approach was 
  to return to each party that with which they had entered the marriage and to 
  share the wealth accumulated during the marriage equally between them. That 
  approach was upheld in this court. The length of the marriage, in that case, 
  was of very little relevance. As Hale LJ perceptively remarked, where "a 
  substantial a surplus had been generated by their joint efforts, it could not 
  matter whether they had taken a short or a long time to do so". The case, in 
  my view, is a warning of the dangers which can flow if there is a 
  disproportionate emphasis on the brevity of the marriage. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=73><A name=para73>The fact that the pre-<I>White</I> approach was 
  discriminatory is, I think, well illustrated by looking at a case like 
  <I>Gojkovic v Gojkovic</I> [1992] Fam 40, a decision now remembered more for 
  this court's judgment on costs than for its facts. It was, however, a very 
  short marriage, during which the parties built up a fortune in the region of 
  £4 to £5 million, all of which was in real property in the husband's sole 
  name. He offered the wife a flat worth £295,000 and a lump sum on a 
  <I>Duxbury</I> basis (she was 49) of £532,000 designed to provide her with a 
  net income for life, index linked, of £30,000 per annum. The judge awarded her 
  £1.3 m, and this court dismissed the husband's appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=74><A name=para74>It is now possible to see, with the wisdom of 
  hindsight, that both the husband's offer (and, it must be said, the judge's 
  award) were discriminatory. Had an applicant in Mrs. Gojkovic's position 
  applied for ancillary relief today, I have no doubt at all that the fair award 
  for her would have been an equal division of the family fortune. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=75><A name=para75><I>Gojkovic v Gojkovic</I> was, of course, a 
  contribution case <I>par excellence, </I>but it is nonetheless a good example 
  of a case in which an unequal division of assets on a needs basis in a short 
  marriage was, viewed with hindsight, both unfair and discriminatory. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=76><A name=para76>In my judgment, the pre-<I>White</I> short 
  marriage cases are all liable to attack on the basis that they are 
  discriminatory. Mr. Marks, in oral argument, sought to turn the point by 
  suggesting, that after a short and childless marriage between young people, it 
  was in reality patronising to give a woman more money than she needed to make 
  herself economically independent, and to enable her "to stand on her own 
  feet". It was a nice advocate's flourish, and his use of the word 
  "patronising" derived from paragraph 64 of the judge's judgment, cited by 
  Thorpe LJ at paragraphs 41 of his. However, the judge's use of the word occurs 
  in the context of the judge determining that "he must strive to avoid a 
  discriminatory approach based on outmoded concepts of differential financial 
  and non-financial contributions". The question therefore is whether, in the 
  instant case, an award limited to enabling Mrs. Miller to be economically 
  independent and to "stand on her own feet" is discriminatory. In my judgment, 
  the answer to that question is plainly "yes". </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=77><A name=para77>Furthermore, I have to say I received no help on 
  the difficult issue of quantum from Mr. Marks' comparisons with awards for 
  libel or professional negligence or personal injuries. Not only were such 
  comparisons, in my judgment, irrelevant, but they seemed to me both to demean 
  the status of marriage, and to take no account of the serious social, 
  financial and psychological effects which irretrievable breakdown frequently 
  have on those who suffer it. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=78><A name=para78>So I am in no doubt at all that the judge was 
  right to reject the pre<I>-White </I>cases. He was right to hold on to the 
  terms of section 25 and the discretionary exercise, and to follow the guidance 
  of Thorpe LJ in <I>McFarlane v. McFarlane; Parlour v Parlour</I> [2004] 2 FLR 
  893 at para 110: - </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The judges must remain focused on the statutory language, 
    albeit recognizing the need for evolutionary construction to reflect social 
    and economic change. The statutory checklist and the overall circumstances 
    of the case allow the judge to reflect factors which are said to be inherent 
    in either the entitlement model or the compensation model. But to adopt one 
    model or another or a combination of more than one is to don a strait- 
    jacket and to deflect concentration from the statutory language. Clearly in 
    the assessment of periodical payments, as of capital provision, the 
    overriding objective is fairness. Discrimination between the sexes must be 
    avoided"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=79><A name=para79>But the question abides: how did the judge reason 
  his conclusion and reach his award? Mr. Mostyn did not, of course, have the 
  luxury of submitting that the judge was right because he had accepted 
  counsel's submissions. There was no respondent's notice. Mr. Mostyn played the 
  width of discretion, fact specific, within the parameters cards, but readily 
  acknowledged that they were not, as generalisations, enough. I searched his 
  skeleton argument in vain for a specific answer to the question. Fortunately, 
  Mr. Mostyn provided it in oral argument. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=80><A name=para80>Mr. Mostyn began by acknowledging that he could 
  not, as he put it, anatomise the one magnetic factor which had attracted the 
  judge's award of £2.7 m for the lump sum. The judge had, however, plainly and 
  rightly taken account of the overall size of the husband's estate, which Mr. 
  Mostyn put as being in the order of £30m to £36m. The size of the matrimonial 
  acquest was between £12m and £18m, and an award of £5m in total from such an 
  estate was in no sense disproportionate. The judge had also been right to take 
  account of Mrs. Miller's commitment to the marriage, and had been entitled to 
  use that factor to neutralize its brevity. When making an assessment of Mrs. 
  Miller's needs, the judge had been entitled to award her the former 
  matrimonial home free of mortgage. He had also been right to make his finding, 
  in paragraph 65 pf the judgment, that Mrs. Miller had a "reasonable 
  expectation that her life as once again a single woman need not revert to what 
  it was before her marriage". Thorpe LJ has cited this paragraph in full in 
  paragraph 41 of his judgment. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=81><A name=para81>Against that background, Mr. Mostyn argued, the 
  margin of appreciation inevitably remained at its widest in the big money, 
  short and childless marriages cases. Within such a wide discretion, it was 
  impossible to say that the judge had misapplied it. The key factors, which the 
  judge had identified, were fairness, non-discrimination and Mrs. Miller's 
  commitment to the marriage. Taken in the context of an estate of this 
  magnitude the judgment, whilst heavily nuanced, was not outside the band. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=82><A name=para82>I have had to consider very carefully whether or 
  not Mr. Mostyn's "nuances" amount to an impermissible re-writing of the 
  judgment, but I have come to the clear conclusion that they do not. On the 
  facts of this particular case, I agree with Mr. Mostyn that the award, whilst 
  undoubtedly high, is "within the band". I add four short points which, in 
  particular, reinforce my view. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=83><A name=para83>The first point is the house. It would have been 
  open to the judge to give Mrs. Miller a fund to purchase alternative 
  accommodation rather than provide her with a mortgage free property worth £2.3 
  m. However, this seems to me a discretionary decision by the judge which, if 
  properly reasoned, is one with which this court cannot properly interfere. 
  There are three particular factors which, in my judgment, support the judge's 
  decision on this point. The first, as Thorpe LJ has pointed out, is that 
  whilst the property is undoubtedly in a fashionable part of London, it is not 
  excessive in size, and has the potential to be used by Mrs. Miller for her 
  business, should she pursue a career in interior design. Secondly, Mr. Miller 
  has chosen for himself and his new family a property worth £6.25 m, also in 
  the same part of London. On that scale, the former matrimonial home appears 
  quite modest. Thirdly, of course, the judge made her give up her half share in 
  the French property, which reduces the value of the house award by £500,000. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=84><A name=para84>My second point relates to the lump sum. Here, the 
  point which strongly influences my perception of the award overall, is the 
  scope of Mr. Miller's wealth. The judge found that on any view he was worth 
  £17.5 million, leaving out of account the fact that the 200,000 shares in New 
  Star were worth between £12.35 m and £18.11 m. On any view, Mr. Miller is a 
  very rich man. No doubt he has worked hard for, and deserves his wealth. But 
  against the scale of that wealth, a lump sum of £2.7 m and an overall award of 
  £5 m cannot, in my judgment, be said to be excessive or disproportionate. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=85><A name=para85>Thirdly, there is also the point, not to be 
  overlooked, that this is a "clean break". If, in ten years time Mr. Miller is 
  worth £50 m of £100 m, that will be his wealth to enjoy. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=86><A name=para86>Fourthly, it follows that in my judgment, this is 
  a case in which section 25(2)(a) is an important factor. Mr. Mostyn accepts 
  that there has to be a departure from equality to achieve fairness to Mr. 
  Miller, and whilst I do not, speaking for myself, think that this is a 
  "matrimonial acquest" case, the point on which one alights when departing from 
  equality must be a matter of broad discretion. If equality on a very 
  conservative approach would have been one half of £17.5 m (i.e. ignoring the 
  New Star shares) for the judge to have alighted at £5 m does not seem to me 
  remotely unfair when, on the facts found by the judge, the whole of the 
  section 25 (2) criteria are taken into consideration. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=87><A name=para87>Finally, I would, speaking for myself, advise 
  caution about the use of this, or any other decision, as a template for 
  others. I have been where Mr. Marks stands in this case. Russell LJ began his 
  judgment in <I>Gojkovic </I>with the following words ([1992] Fam. 40 at 49]): 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In his opening submissions to this court, counsel for the 
    husband invited us to lay down guidelines which would, he said, be of 
    assistance to those charged with the responsibility of deciding what, after 
    divorce, is the appropriate level of lump sum payments in cases where very 
    substantial capital assets are available. I do not think that such an 
    exercise is possible. The guidelines already exist. <U>Section 23</U> of the 
    Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 is the enabling provision for an order for the 
    payment of a lump sum. Section 25, as amended by the <U>Matrimonial and 
    Family Proceedings Act 1984, </U>in terms, requires the court to have regard 
    to all the circumstances of the case and subsection (2), under no less than 
    eight sub-paragraphs, sets out the matters to which the court in particular 
    shall have regard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In the individual case, some of those matters will assume 
    greater importance than others and, indeed, the facts of this case well 
    illustrate that proposition. In my judgment in this case we are concerned 
    with a wholly exceptional set of circumstances ……"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=88><A name=para88>If those words have a familiar ring, it is because 
  they have been spoken by every judicial generation since section 25 of the MCA 
  1973 had its first expression as section 5 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and 
  Property Act 1970. I first heard them in the well-known judgment of Ormrod LJ 
  in Martin<I> v. Martin</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="../1977/7.html">[1978] Fam 12</a> at 19, which I will not repeat. The 
  consistent message from this court has been that the judge must apply the 
  factors identified in section 25(2) to the facts of the individual case. The 
  House of Lords in <I>White</I> now tells us, and <I>Foster</I> in this court 
  confirms, that the objective is a fair result that avoids discrimination. 
  Proposed outcomes can be tested against the yardstick of equality. These are 
  the guidelines which practitioners and the courts must strive to follow. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=89><A name=para89>For the reasons I have attempted to give, I have 
  come to the conclusion that the judge's order, examined against these 
  criteria, passes the test. I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Mrs Justice Black:</B></P>
  <LI value=90><A name=para90>I have had the opportunity of reading both 
  judgments and I agree. </A>
