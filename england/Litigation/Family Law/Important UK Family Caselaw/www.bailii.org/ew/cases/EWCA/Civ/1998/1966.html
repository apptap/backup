<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE THORPE: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The History <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Mr and Mrs Xydhias married in 1977 and have three children, only 
two of whom are now minors. In June 1994 Mrs Xydhias, the wife, petitioned for 
divorce and in April 1995 filed her application for ancillary relief. The 
subsequent progress of that application towards final hearing was bedevilled by 
the husband’s breach of his duty to make full and frank disclosure. A penal 
notice was necessary to compel his affidavit of July 1995. The document itself 
was incomplete and misleading. The inevitable result was a string of 
questionnaires, directions hearings and production appointments. By those means 
sufficient information materialised to enable the wife’s solicitors to obtain a 
three day fixture for trial commencing 2nd September 1996. In August each side 
filed a report from a forensic accountant. The wife’s expert assessed the 
husband’s worth at £2.25M. The husband’s expert assessed his worth at about 
£1.1M. The experts broadly agreed that he had a net income of about £70K a year. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Obviously unless the husband compromised the case, or protected 
his position by a realistic Calderbank offer, he was in danger of paying the 
costs on both sides, possibly even on an indemnity basis in the light of his 
misconduct. Between March and July 1996 negotiations proceeded on a Calderbank 
basis. By a letter of 5th July the husband’s solicitors offered the wife the 
former matrimonial home plus a lump sum of £100K in full and final settlement of 
her claims, with maintenance for the children but with no order as to costs. The 
wife’s response of 13th August sought an additional £150K plus an order for 
costs. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Six days later Miss Brown, the wife’s counsel telephoned Mr 
Keehan to explore the possibility of settlement. Matters did not advance, 
probably because Mr Keehan had a conference fixed for the following day. At the 
conclusion of that conference with his client Mr Keehan telephoned Miss Brown 
and on his client’s instructions sought a minimal reduction: either a lump sum 
of £250K with no order for costs alternatively, if the petitioner were to have 
her taxed costs, then the lump sum would reduce to £225K. There were ancillary 
proposals for dates of transfer and payment together with proposals for child 
maintenance and for indemnifying the wife in respect of debts arising out of 
their business partnership. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>It transpired that both sides had fixed further conferences with 
the clients for 22nd August. Clearly there was little between the parties and Mr 
Keehan sensibly re-arranged the venue of his conference to ensure that counsel, 
solicitors, and clients would all be beneath the same roof but in separate rooms 
on the afternoon of 22nd August. Mr Keehan offered to put his proposals in 
writing prior to the commencement of the joint conference. The document that Mr 
Keehan produced prior to the commencement of the joint conference was a great 
elaboration of the simple terms proposed on 20th August. It was in the form of a 
draft order and extended to eight pages. It was later labelled Draft 1. He might 
have prepared a simple heads of agreement to record what one was prepared to 
provide and the other prepared to receive. However he leapfrogged that stage and 
attempted to go to the end position, namely the extension of the simple 
agreement into the language of the court, replete with recitals and undertakings 
and schedules. No doubt he was mindful of the imminent fixture and the 
desirability of presenting the district judge with a completely crafted draft 
order. An unusual feature of Mr Keehan’s draft was that it contained an 
undertaking by the husband to execute legal charges in respect of ten separate 
properties specified in the first schedule to secure the payment to the 
petitioner of the lump sum. Although now rare, arrangements to secure the 
performance of continuing periodical payments orders were once commonplace. But 
in my experience the provision of security for the payment of a lump sum is 
unknown. Of course its justification was that the husband required a period of 
36 months in which to complete the payment of the capital sum. The telephone 
offer made on 20th August had made no mention of security although it accepted 
that interest on outstanding instalments would accrue at 2% over base. It 
appears that it was Mr Keehan who first introduced the concept of securing 
payment of future instalments in addition to compensating the wife for the delay 
by payment of either interest or periodical payments. Whilst it is possible to 
see the sense of security for the payment of a lump sum by instalments long 
deferred it is harder to understand the development that emerged in Draft 2 
whereby the husband undertook to charge shares and properties to secure not just 
the payment of the lump sum in full but also the performance of the full range 
of his obligations extending to the transfer of his share in the matrimonial 
home and the division of chattels. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The negotiations on 22nd August, despite the fact that the 
parties were so close, lasted from 2.30pm to 8.00pm. But the time was 
productively spent and Mr Keehan pressed for a document signed by the parties 
that evening. Miss Brown refused on instructions, saying that until she could 
consider a full and fair copy of all that had been agreed she would not bind her 
client although her client would not seek to renege. On that basis the parties 
separated. Mr Keehan remained in chambers and at about 10.00pm faxed the full 
and fair copy to Miss Brown’s home. The reason he finished the work that day was 
that he planned to start a holiday in the west country on the following morning. 
The document which he faxed has been labelled Draft 2. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Over the course of the next few days negotiations continued, 
partly through counsel and partly through solicitors. Perhaps this was the 
result of Mr Keehan’s absence from chambers, although he had a fax at his 
holiday address and continued to communicate with Miss Brown both by fax and 
telephone. This industry led to the production of further drafts which have been 
labelled 3, 4 and 5. For the purposes of this judgment it is unnecessary to 
record the variations thereby advanced. Partly they consisted of drafting 
points, partly the correction of errors and partly variations in the proposals 
for securing payment of the lump sum. What is abundantly plain to me is that 
during the course of these exchanges Miss Brown was fully committed to the 
search for compromise. If not expressly then impliedly she withdrew the caveat 
which she had entered on 20th August. Manifestly the pressure that induced the 
caveat had evaporated. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The solicitors were also communicating with the court. On 27th 
August the wife’s solicitor wrote to the district judge’s listing officer. I 
quote four paragraphs from the letter: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“Heads of terms have been agreed between the parties and subject 
to agreement as to the terms of the proposed consent order and the giving of 
security by Mr Xydhias, the respondent, to underpin his proposals, matters are 
agreed. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The three days will not now be required and, subject to Mr 
Xydhias’ counsel approving the final version of the order we will only need a 
short appointment next week to place the order before the court for 
consideration. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>However as the matter is complex this short appointment should, 
ideally, be for 45 minutes. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>We understand Mr Xydhias’ solicitors, Williams, Freeman and 
Lloyd are closed today. However we are sending them a copy of this fax and no 
doubt they will be confirming the position to you tomorrow.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>On 28th August there was a discussion on the telephone between 
Miss Brown and Mr Keehan. They identified the two remaining issues as: 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“(a) Whether or not the respondent would be willing to include 
additional properties to the schedule of securities, and if so, which, and, 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(b) The duration of the respondent’s continuing obligations.” 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Counsel agreed that these were relatively minor questions of 
form and not matters of substance. On the same day the wife’s solicitor wrote a 
letter to Miss Brown formerly releasing her from attending the fixture 
commencing 2nd September. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>On 29th August the wife’s solicitor again wrote to the court. 
The essential part is as follows: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“1. Heads of terms of settlement have been agreed between the 
parties following lengthy negotiations between counsel for both parties. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>2. The proposed settlement (inter alia) involves the payment of 
a lump sum by instalments. In this case it is accepted by both sides that 
security should be given for the deferred payments. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>3. Draft security documents have been prepared by us and were 
sent by fax to Mr Xydhias’ solicitors on Tuesday. So far they have not been 
approved. A revised security document and a further security document will have 
to be prepared. These documents will hopefully be sent to Mr Xydhias’ solicitors 
for approval today. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>4. We had hoped that the order could refer to the security 
documents as agreed. In the event that time does not allow this to happen then 
this difficulty can be overcome by a reference to the security documents being 
agreed between the solicitors and in default of agreement as drafted by 
conveyancing counsel. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>5. We were advised by Miss Brown that the court should be 
notified on Tuesday that the matter was so close to settling in order to save 
wastage of court time. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>6. We are conscious not only of a possible wastage of court time 
but that we need to save a wasted brief fee for our client as well. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>7. We therefore suggest that the case is removed from the list 
subject to a 45 minutes appointment at 10.00am on Monday morning. We will then 
be able to either put the order before the court for approval or if this is not 
possible ask that there is a further appointment listed with a time estimate of 
45 minutes to allow further negotiations/consideration of the proposed order.” 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>On the same day Mr Keehan faxed to Miss Brown the fourth version 
of the consent order. Miss Brown telephoned him in response and said that she 
agreed that draft. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>However also on 29th August the husband’s solicitors 
communicated with the wife’s solicitor and attempted to vary in the husband’s 
favour the timetable for paying the lump sum. On 30th August the wife’s 
solicitor passed that letter on to Miss Brown with the comment that it was an 
attempt to move the goal posts. Miss Brown therefore faxed Mr Keehan to the 
effect that the letter of 29th August represented an unacceptable attempt to 
alter the agreement. However on the following day in the course of a telephone 
conversation between counsel Miss Brown said that she would be prepared to 
advise some flexibility on that issue in order to maintain the agreement. That 
conversation concluded counsel’s involvement. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Of course neither counsel attended the short appointment on 2nd 
September during the course of which the husband’s solicitor stated on 
instructions that he had withdrawn all offers and that the case would be fully 
fought. The wife’s solicitor had little option but to seek an interim order from 
the district judge and a four day fixture commencing 19th November, a date on 
which both Mr Keehan and Miss Brown would be available. Certainly the directions 
given on the 2nd September were appropriate for a trial of the applications at 
large. However on 25th September the respondent applied for various directions 
including leave to file an affidavit by Mr Keehan. By that date the respondent 
had changed his solicitors. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Then on 7th October the wife filed notice of application for an 
order that: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“1. The respondent do show cause why an order should not be made 
in the terms of an agreement reached between the petitioner and respondent 
between 22-29 August 1996.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Alternatively directions were sought in preparation for a full 
trial. On 8th October the district judge ordered the wife’s application for an 
order in terms of an agreement to be tried as a preliminary issue on 19th 
November with a time estimate of two days and appropriate directions were given 
for the filing of affidavits and documents relevant to the preliminary issue. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Issues In The Court Below <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The evidence then filed upon the preliminary issue consisted of 
an affidavit by the husband, an affidavit by Mr Keehan, an affidavit by Miss 
Brown and an affidavit by the wife’s solicitor. The husband in his affidavit 
said that he did not believe that a binding agreement had been entered into and 
that after discussions with his business accountant, as opposed to his forensic 
accountant, he told his solicitor to withdraw the proposed settlement. The 
affidavits of counsel recounted their involvement at length. Happily there was 
no substantial issue between them. The wife’s solicitor equally gave a lengthy 
account of her involvement. Of her attendance at court on 2nd September she 
said: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“I still hoped that the few remaining practical matters would be 
resolved at the court and that the respondent would adhere to the previously 
agreed time-scale for payment of the first instalment.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>At the hearing on 19th November the wife was represented by Mr 
Horowitz QC and Mr Bishop and the husband by Mr Hess. Mr Horowitz relied on two 
principles. The first was that provided the court is satisfied that parties 
intended to be bound and essential terms were agreed the contract would be 
upheld even where further significant terms were to be agreed later. In support 
he cited both <I>Chitty </I>and<I> Treitel on Contract </I>. His second 
principle was that, whilst the first had been developed in the sphere of 
commercial agreements, it was wholly consistent with the practice and policy of 
the family court in upholding bargains properly made. Mr Hess submitted that the 
question was to be decided on the application of normal contractual principles, 
that those principles dictate that unless all the material terms are agreed or 
the contract contains an agreed mechanism for ascertaining what is not agreed 
then there is no contract. Further in the matrimonial context if there is no 
concluded agreement the application must be decided at large without reference 
to the negotiations. In support he relied upon a number of authorities, perhaps 
principally <I>Foley v Classique </I><I>Coaches</I> [1934] 2 KB 1. Apparently 
during the course of the hearing Mr Hess discovered and relied upon the case of 
<I>Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Limited </I>[1987] 2 LLR 601. Mr Horowitz accepted 
the relevance of that authority but contended that of the six principles 
identified by Lloyd LJ at 619, principles 4-6 plainly demonstrated a concluded 
contract between the parties. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The district judge delivered a written judgment on the 25th 
November. He said <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“From a close review of the events which took place between 22nd 
August and 2nd September 1996 it is clear: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(a) That the parties wished to conclude an agreement before the 
court was called upon to decide the issue on 2nd September. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(b) That by a process of detailed negotiations between counsel 
and solicitors for each party the issues were gradually narrowed down to a point 
where by some time probably on 29th August (it is difficult to pin down a 
defining moment) the essential building blocks of an agreement were in place.” 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The district judge in finding for the wife excised from Draft 4 
only two points that the husband had not expressly agreed namely: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(a) The inclusion within the schedule of properties to be 
charged to secure the payment of the lump sum a property which the husband owned 
jointly with his father. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(b) The wife’s proposal to save a taxation by quantifying the 
husband’s pre-existing liability for the costs of the divorce at £350. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>On 19th December the husband filed notice of appeal asserting 
that the district judge had been wrong as a matter of fact and/or law. Again Mr 
Horowitz and Mr Bishop prepared a lengthy skeleton argument for the purposes of 
that appeal. In an extended presentation of the case law relevant to the 
formation of commercial contracts Mr Horowitz submitted that the court had to 
decide whether the parties intended to be bound by the terms of an agreement, if 
so what remained outstanding, and did failure to reach agreement on any 
outstanding matter render the agreement unworkable. He relied heavily on the 
judgment of Lloyd LJ in <I>Pagnan</I>. He repeated the submission advanced in 
the court below that this principle developed in the sphere of commercial 
agreements was wholly consistent with the practice and policy of the family 
court. A skeleton argument of Mr Eccles QC and Mr Hess for the husband set out 
similar principles of contract law, relied on the same authorities, but 
contended that they produced the opposite result. The appeal came before His 
Honour Judge Hamilton who heard no oral evidence. He reviewed the relevant 
factual history succinctly and meticulously. He set out the legal principles 
that had been presented in the skeleton arguments. He reviewed the district 
judge’s decision most carefully and he upheld it. Judge Hamilton made some small 
revisions to the order removing undertakings and relaxing the timetable of 
instalments in accordance with a concession made by the wife. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>On 13th January 1998 Judge Hamilton refused leave to appeal but 
leave was subsequently granted on paper by this court. By way of footnote to 
this history the wife has had to issue judgment summonses in order to obtain 
even interim provision from the husband. On the hearing of one of those 
summonses on 9th March 1998 Judge Hamilton heard oral evidence from the husband. 
In the course of that evidence the husband said that there had been an agreement 
but that he had been forced into it. The judge disbelieved that evidence. Of his 
evidence generally the judge held that the husband was untruthful about his 
financial transactions because of his determination that the wife should get 
nothing and because of his attempt to manipulate financial matters to her 
disadvantage. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Appeal <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The skeleton argument prepared by Mr Eccles and Mr Hess for the 
purposes of this appeal was in its essence summarised in this quotation: 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“Ordinary contractual principles apply: <I>Peacock v Peacock 
</I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/5.html">[1991] 1</a> FLR 324, <I>Harte v Harte </I>(Times 2nd December 1976). 
Contractual principles are summarised in <I>Pagnan v Feed Products.” 
</I><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Mr Horowitz and Mr Bishop in their skeleton submitted that the 
applicable principles of law are derived from the law of contract and were 
correctly applied. The only distinction between ordinary contract law and the 
application of contract law in the field of ancillary relief is the effect of 
section 25 by which the agreement must subsequently be considered and approved 
by the court, which may decline to make an order in the terms agreed. No such 
issue arises directly in this case because both district judge and Judge 
Hamilton correctly held that the agreement should be approved by the court under 
the principles derived from <I>Edgar v Edgar </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1980/2.html">[1980] 1 WLR 1410</a>. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>That is a reference to the fact that in the county court the 
husband had not only submitted that there was no agreement but also that, if 
there was an agreement, he should not be held to it on <I>Edgar </I>principles. 
In this court the husband has not pursued that second submission thereby 
accepting that, if an agreement for compromise is found despite his submissions, 
there are no grounds upon which he can escape its transition into the order 
refined in the court below. Thus in this court both skeletons proceeded on the 
footing that the outcome of the appeal depended upon the application of the 
<I>Pagnan</I> principles to the facts. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Having read the skeleton arguments my lord, Lord Justice 
Stuart-Smith, raised the question as to whether the agreement, even if concluded 
and in writing, might not fail to meet the requirements of <A

<A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/">(Miscellaneous 
Provisions) Act 1989</A>. That question resulted in a prompt amendment of the 
notice of appeal to introduce that additional contention at the outset of the 
hearing. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In his oral argument Mr Eccles developed the additional argument 
that all the negotiations between the parties had been without prejudice and 
that, since the negotiations had not resulted in a compromise, evidence of the 
negotiations should not have been admitted. Although he had referred to both 
<I>Peacock v Peacock </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/5.html">[1991] 1</a> FLR 324 and <I>Kelley v Corston </I>[1998] 3 
WLR 246 in his skeleton Mr Eccles did not accept that compromises in ancillary 
relief were on any different footing to compromises of actions in other 
divisions. He submitted that were it concluded that the question for the court 
was to determine whether the exchanges between the parties precluded the 
respondent from his ordinary right to a full trial practitioners would be 
deprived of any certainties. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Mr Horowitz had not referred to <I>Peacock v Peacock </I>or 
<I>Kelley v Corston </I>in his skeleton and on the first day accepted with 
little seeming enthusiasm an alternative formulation of his case on the basis 
that the issue before the district judge was not to be determined by applying 
the principles regulating the formation of commercial contracts but by 
exercising a broader discretion to judge if the parties were <I>ad idem </I>as 
to the extent of the financial redistribution and as to whether the husband had 
so conducted himself as to forfeit his right to a fully contested trial. On the 
second day he adopted the alternative formulation more robustly but always 
tenaciously contending that the appeal should be dismissed upon the application 
of the <I>Pagnan</I> principles. At the close of his submissions he assented to 
the court’s suggestion that he should file a respondent’s notice setting up the 
alternative formulation and an opportunity was given to Mr Eccles to make 
further written submissions on the respondent’s notice. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Conclusions<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>I set out my conclusions on the legal arguments under three 
heads. I will consider first the applicable principles, second the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/s2.html">section 
2</A>(3) argument and third the submission that the evidence in support of the 
wife’s application should have been excluded on the grounds of privilege. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Applicable Principles <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>My cardinal conclusion is that ordinary contractual principles 
do not determine the issues in this appeal. This is because of the fundamental 
distinction that an agreement for the compromise of an ancillary relief 
application does not give rise to a contract enforceable in law. The parties 
seeking to uphold a concluded agreement for the compromise of such an 
application cannot sue for specific performance. The only way of rendering the 
bargain enforceable, whether to ensure that the applicant obtains the agreed 
transfers and payments or whether to protect the respondent from future claims, 
is to convert the concluded agreement into an order of the court. The decision 
of the Privy Council in <I>de Lasala v de Lasala </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1979/1979_10.html">[1980] AC 546</a> demonstrated 
that thereafter the rights and obligations of the parties are determined by the 
order and not by any agreement which preceded it. The order is absolute unless 
there is a statutory power to vary or unless vitiated by a fact that would 
vitiate an order in any other division. Additionally, as was demonstrated in 
<I>Robinson v Robinson </I>[1983] FLR 102 an order in ancillary relief 
proceedings may be set aside if the product of a material breach of the duty of 
full and frank disclosure. An even more singular feature of the transition from 
compromise to order in ancillary relief proceedings is that the court does not 
either automatically or invariably grant the application to give the bargain in 
the force of an order. The court conducts an independent assessment to enable it 
to discharge its statutory function to make such orders as reflect the criteria 
listed in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act as amended. The decision of 
this court in <I>Kelley v Corston </I>has a decisive impact on this appeal, as 
was pointed out by my lord, Lord Justice Mummery. Although the judgments in 
<I>Kelley v Corston </I>have since been criticised by this court in the case of 
<I>Arthur JS Hall &amp; Co (a firm) v Simmons </I>(The Times: 18th December 
1998), the <I>Peacock v Peacock </I>point, with which we are concerned, was 
again affirmed by the judgment of the court. Lord Justice Pill in his judgment 
approved the first instance decision of <I>Peacock v Peacock </I>and continued 
at 268G: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“Section 33A deals expressly with consent orders for financial 
relief. It was enacted to enable courts to deal with consent applications upon a 
consideration of the papers. However it does not in my judgment remove the duty 
of the court to consider the merits of the settlement. The parties have a duty 
of full and frank disclosure. They must disclose the information prescribed by 
rules of court. The court then has a duty, in the context of the statute, to 
consider whether there are other circumstances into which it ought to enquire. 
It follows from the existence of that duty, which will no doubt lead to the 
making of further enquiries in some cases, that, if a consent order is made, it 
is made with the approval by the court of its contents.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The reference to procedure under section 33A has no bearing on 
this appeal where the information as to the parties respective financial 
circumstances was contained in extensive preparation for full trial in 
compliance with directions of the court. But the remainder of the citation is 
directly in point. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In similar vein Lady Justice Butler-Sloss, having approved the 
same passage from the judgment in <I>Peacock v Peacock, </I>continued at 273: 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“The court retains the duty laid upon it under section 25 in 
respect of consent orders as well as contested proceedings. It has to scrutinise 
the draft order and to check, within the limited information made available, 
whether there are other matters which require the court to make enquiries. The 
court has the power to refuse to make the order although the parties have agreed 
it. The fact of the agreement will, of course, be likely to be an important 
consideration but would not necessarily be determinative. The court is not a 
rubber stamp.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>At the foot of the same page she described this balance in 
ancillary relief litigation as, ‘a <I></I>situation entirely different from the 
jurisdiction in the other Divisions of the High Court or civil litigation in the 
county court.’ <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In consequence, it is clear that the award to an applicant for 
ancillary relief is always fixed by the court. The payer’s liability cannot be 
ultimately fixed by compromise as can be done in the settlement of claims in 
other divisions. Therefore the purpose of negotiation is not to finally 
determine the liability (that can only be done by the court) but to reduce the 
length and expense of the process by which the court carries out its function. 
If there is a dispute as to whether the negotiations led to an accord that the 
process should be abbreviated, the court has a discretion in determining whether 
an accord was reached. In exercising that discretion the court should be astute 
to discern the antics of a litigant who, having consistently pressed for 
abbreviation, is seeking to resile and to justify his shift by reliance on some 
point of detail that was open for determination by the court at its abbreviated 
hearing. If the court concludes that the parties agreed to settle on terms then 
it may have to consider whether the terms were vitiated by a factor such as 
material non disclosure or tainted by a factor within the parameters set in 
<I>Edgar v Edgar. </I>Finally in every case the court must exercise its 
independent discretionary review applying the section 25 criteria to the 
circumstances of the case and to the terms of the accord. This approach 
particularly applies to accords intended to obviate delivery of briefs for 
trial. Different considerations may apply to agreements not negotiated in the 
shadow of an impending fixture. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>It is well recognised by all experienced practitioners, whether 
solicitors or counsel, that contested ancillary relief proceedings are expensive 
and by far the most expensive stage of the process is the trial, preceded by 
delivery of briefs. There have been innumerable examples over more than the last 
decade of cases in which the legal costs incurred have been quite 
disproportionate to the assets available for division. This perception has 
engendered the Calderbank procedure and more recently the interdisciplinary 
development of modern procedures designed to excise much of the elaboration and 
waste that have become the hallmarks of the old procedure. Litigants in 
ancillary relief proceedings are subjected to great emotional and psychological 
stresses, particularly as the date of trial approaches. In my opinion there are 
sound policy reasons supporting the conclusion that the judge is entitled to 
exercise a broad discretion to determine whether the parties have agreed to 
settle. The pilot scheme depends on judicial control of the process from start 
to finish. The court has a clear interest in curbing excessive adversariality 
and in excluding from trial lists unnecessary litigation. A more legalistic 
approach, as this case illustrates, only allows the inconsistent or manipulative 
litigant to repudiate an agreement on the ground that some point of drafting, 
detail, or implementation had not been clearly resolved. Ordinarily heads of 
agreement signed by the parties or a clear exchange of solicitors letters will 
establish the consensus. Hopefully a case such as this requiring the exercise of 
the judge’s discretion will be a rarity. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/s2.html">Section 
2</A>(3) Point <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The relevant subsections of <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/s2.html">section 2</A> 
of the <A href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/">Law of 
Property (Miscellaneous</A> <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/">Provisions) Act 
1989</A> are as follows: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“2(1) A contract for the sale or other disposition of an 
interest in land can only be made in writing and only by incorporating all the 
terms which the parties have expressly agreed in one document or, where 
contracts are exchanged, in each. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(2) The terms may be incorporated in a document either by being 
set out in it or by reference to some other document. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>(3) The document incorporating the terms or, where contracts are 
exchanged, one of the documents incorporating them (but not necessarily the same 
one) must be signed by or on behalf of each party to the contract.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Thus Mr Eccles submits that if there were a concluded contract 
it fails the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/s2.html">section 2</A> 
test since it is for the disposition of an interest in land and it is not signed 
by or on behalf of each party to the contract. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In my opinion this point too is settled by a proper analysis of 
the nature and effect of an agreement to compromise ancillary relief 
proceedings. The agreement, if concluded, is not one for the disposition of an 
interest in land but an agreement as to the terms which the parties themselves 
considered fair with the object of avoiding the expense and stress of a 
contested hearing. One of the terms of the agreement may be that the husband 
will submit to a transfer of property order in respect of the final matrimonial 
home. Such an order once made would require the husband’s signature to a 
transfer. But if he declines to sign the document the district judge will sign 
in his stead. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Claim to Privilege <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>In ancillary relief litigation negotiations may proceed on one 
of three basis, without prejudice, Calderbank or open. If negotiations proceed 
on a without prejudice basis then I would accept Mr Eccles’ submission that they 
are governed by the following passage from the speech of Lord Griffiths in 
<I>Rush &amp; Tompkins Limited </I><I>v GLC </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/7.html">[1989] AC 1280</a>: <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>“The rule applies to exclude all negotiations genuinely aimed at 
settlement whether oral or in writing from being given in evidence. A competent 
solicitor will always head any negotiating correspondence ‘ <I>without prejudice 
</I>’ to make clear beyond doubt that in the event of the negotiations being 
unsuccessful they are not to be referred to at the subsequent trial. However, 
the application of the rule is not dependant upon the use of the phrase ‘ 
<I>without prejudice </I>’ and if it is clear from the surrounding circumstances 
that the parties were seeking to compromise the action, evidence of the content 
of those negotiations will, as a general rule, not be admissible at the trial 
and cannot be used to establish an admission or partial admission. I cannot 
therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that the problem in the present case 
should be resolved by a linguistic approach to the meaning of the phrase ‘ 
<I>without prejudice </I>’. I believe that the question has to be looked at more 
broadly and resolved by balancing two different public interests namely the 
public interest in promoting settlements and the public interest in full 
discovery between parties to litigation.” <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>There is no special rule governing without prejudice negotiation 
in ancillary relief proceedings. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Calderbank is but a variant allowing what would otherwise be 
privileged to be put in evidence in the determination of any issue on costs. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Outcome Of The Present Appeal <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The principal issue in this appeal is not difficult to decide on 
the application of the first principle. It is relevant to regard not only the 
offers and counter offers in their terminology but also the communications with 
the court and the understanding of those involved. Clearly both counsel 
understood that they had settled the case. Clearly the solicitors understood 
that they had no need for advocates. Briefs were not delivered and the court was 
informed that the case had settled and that the fixture was vacated. Those 
convictions rested on firm foundation. In ancillary relief litigation a clear 
distinction has always been drawn between the determination of the liability and 
the determination of the security for the performance of the obligation. In the 
years when secured provision orders were common place counsel regularly settled 
cases on the footing that if the quantum of the annual payment could be agreed 
the mechanism that would be triggered to secure the recipient in the event of 
the payer’s default would be separately and subsequently put into place either 
by further agreement or by the determination of the court. I have no doubt that 
that long established practice informs and explains the communications between 
counsel as well as their readiness to regard the detail of the properties to be 
included within the schedule as ancillary and not precedent to a concluded 
agreement. Of course if the issue had to be decided on the stricter basis of 
pure contractual principle then the saga of the developing drafts and the 
complementary exchanges between solicitors would have to be examined in much 
greater detail. The ambiguities and the inconsistencies that such an analysis 
would reveal would all tell against a finding of concluded contract on <I>Pagnan 
</I>principles. However on the evidence before him I am in no doubt that the 
district judge rightly held that the parties had concluded a compromise during 
the week before the hearing. Throughout that week it was the husband who was 
pressing for a settlement and plainly there came a point at which the wife 
agreed his terms. All that remained unresolved was either mechanics or trivial. 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/loppa1989479/s2.html">Section 2</A> 
<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The considerations special to ancillary relief litigation also 
determine this issue against the appellant for the reasons which I have stated 
above. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The Claim To Privilege <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>The negotiations with which we are concerned open with the 
letter of 13th August which is undoubtedly labelled to have been written on the 
Calderbank basis. None of the written communications between counsel specify 
their status and there is no evidence as to the basis upon which counsel 
themselves regarded the negotiation. The relevant letters between solicitors do 
carry the without prejudice label in some instances but on and after 28th August 
the wife’s solicitor dropped the ‘without prejudice’ label from her letters and 
it was not employed by the husband’s solicitors throughout the relevant 
exchange. It appears that the point was not investigated below, the husband 
being content to rely on the contention that no agreement had been made. No 
objection was taken before the district judge to the admission of evidence of 
negotiation or of concessions made in the course of without prejudice 
communications. Indeed it was the husband who first sought leave to introduce 
the evidence of his negotiating counsel. Of course an agreement serves to open 
without prejudice correspondence and if there is a dispute as to whether or not 
that stage was reached the without prejudice record must be admitted to 
determine that issue. Since I am in no doubt that an agreement was concluded 
this issue requires no further consideration. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Postscript<BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>This case illustrates the deficiencies of current ancillary 
relief procedures. By his manipulation and abuse of the system the husband has 
frustrated the wife’s reasonable objective to achieve independent financial 
security. 3½ years after issuing her notice of application she is no further 
forward despite incurring what must be very considerable legal costs. The Lord 
Chancellor’s Ancillary Relief Advisory Group has made proposals for new 
procedures, reformed routes of appeal in family proceedings and the 
rationalisation of enforcement remedies. If all these proposals are accepted 
this sort of litigation history will hopefully not be repeated. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>There are perhaps two lessons for specialist practitioners. The 
first is to distinguish clearly between the two stages of negotiation. The first 
stage is to establish what the applicant is to receive. That should be expressed 
in simple terms in heads of agreement signed by both counsel and their clients. 
All who appeared with or against the late Mr Jackson QC will remember that was 
for him a cardinal rule. The formality marks the conclusion of that part of the 
negotiating process which the parties dominate. The subsequent task of 
expressing the heads of agreement in the language of an order of the court is 
one to which they ordinarily make little contribution and, although it generally 
precedes the presentation of the agreement to the judge for his consideration, 
it can as well be done after the judge has determined the issue. The signature 
of the parties to a draft consent order hardly seems apt. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Second it seems to me desirable that counsel should explicitly 
agree whether their negotiations are open or without prejudice. Ordinarily they 
are likely to be without prejudice and if they do not achieve a concluded 
agreement the aftermath is likely to be an exchange of Calderbank and/or open 
correspondence. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Mr Eccles in his submissions referred us to procedures to be 
introduced by the <A 
href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/fla1996114/">Family Law Act 
1996</A></A>. Those are radical changes that will have a substantial impact on 
current practice. But since the relevant part will not come into force before 
April 2000 at the earliest it would be premature to consider them in this 
judgment. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>I would dismiss the appeal on the grounds advanced in the 
respondent’s notice. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE MUMMERY: I agree. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: I also agree. <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left><U></U><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Order: Appeal dismissed; costs below as ordered; <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>respondent to have 86% of appeal costs; <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>application for leave to appeal to the House <BR></DIV>
<DIV align=left>of Lords refused; application for stay of <BR></DIV>
