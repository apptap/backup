  <LI value=1><A name=para1>This case has been before the High Court of the 
  Family Division on several occasions. I gave a short judgment on the 
  4<SUP>th</SUP> November 2002 (see [2003] 1FLR 412) setting out the facts which 
  were then known. The main issue before the court at this hearing is to 
  establish the legal parentage of YA and ZA (the twins). Everyone concerned 
  with the problems which have arisen in this case agrees that the twins should 
  remain with the family into which they were born, with Mr and Mrs A. It is 
  clear from the facts now established that Mrs A gave birth to the twins and is 
  their biological mother. It is equally clear from the DNA tests that Mr B is 
  their biological father. Both families sought treatment within the provisions 
  of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (the 1990 Act). In order to 
  establish the legal parentage of the twins, it is necessary to consider 
  whether certain provisions of the 1990 Act, principally sections 28 and 29 and 
  Schedule 3, apply to the facts of this case. If section 28(2) or (3) applies, 
  Mr A will be treated for all purposes as the father. If this case does not 
  come within the provisions of section 28(2) or (3), Mr B, as the biological 
  father, will be the legal father. Because he was not married to the mother, 
  however, he would not have parental responsibility for the twins unless it was 
  specifically conferred upon him. In the event that it becomes necessary to 
  make any decisions to ensure the long-term welfare of the twins, the legal 
  status of their parentage must be established. At birth, they were registered 
  as the children of Mr and Mrs A. Mr B has made an application under section 
  55A of the Family Law Act 1986, as amended, for a declaration of parentage. By 
  agreement of all parties, I have adjourned that application generally. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The parties </B></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>I have been assisted greatly by the excellent 
  written and oral submissions of all the counsel in this difficult case. Miss 
  Parker QC, on behalf of Mr and Mrs B, submitted on the legislation that 
  sections 28(2) and (3) did not apply and that Mr B was the legal father. Mr 
  Eadie, on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Department of Health, (D of 
  H), supported her submission. It was also supported by Miss Rose for the Human 
  Fertility and Embryology Authority (the Authority), and by Mr Jackson QC for 
  the Official Solicitor representing the twins. Miss Hamilton QC, for Mr and 
  Mrs A, submitted that section 28 applied and that, in accordance with the 
  irrebuttable presumption provided by section 28(4) and section 29(1), Mr A was 
  the legal father. She was supported by Mr Francis QC, for the Leeds Teaching 
  Hospitals NHS Trust, (the NHS Trust). Mr Garnham QC, instructed by the 
  Attorney General as Advocate to the Court, very helpfully considered the 
  submissions of all the other parties and submitted to the court that section 
  28 did not apply to the facts of this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>Before considering the competing arguments on the 
  1990 Act, the relevance of the European Convention and the Human Rights Act 
  1998 to the 1990 Act and whether an issue of incompatibility arises, I shall 
  set out a summary of the background facts surrounding the conception and birth 
  of the twins which I largely take, with gratitude, from the skeleton argument 
  provided by Miss Parker and her junior, Mr Foster. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Background Facts</B></P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>Mr and Mrs A and Mr and Mrs B attended at the Clinic 
  run by the NHS Trust to undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques 
  ("ICSI") using the eggs of the wife in each case and the sperm of the husband 
  in each case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>Mr Leigh, giving evidence for the NHS Trust, in his 
  fourth witness statement, dated 18<SUP>th</SUP> November 2002, stated that: 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>a) Mrs A consented to her eggs being used and mixed with her 
    husband's sperm. She did not consent to her eggs being mixed with named or 
    anonymous donated sperm. She consented to the placing of not more than two 
    resulting embryos in her uterus. She consented to her eggs and any resulting 
    embryo being used in her own treatment or in any research project. She 
    refused to consent to her eggs or embryos being used in treating others. 
    <P></P>
    <P>b) Mr A consented to his wife's treatment, and confirmed his 
    understanding that he would be the father of any resulting child. He 
    consented to his sperm being used to treat his wife. He refused to consent 
    to its being used to treat others or for research. He consented to his sperm 
    being used to fertilise his wife's eggs in vitro and to the embryos 
    developed from these eggs being used in the treatment of himself together 
    with a named partner, his wife. He refused to consent to the embryos being 
    used for the purpose of treatment of others but did consent to them being 
    used in any project of research.</P>
    <P>c) Mrs B consented to her eggs being mixed with her husband's sperm and 
    two resulting embryos being placed in her uterus. She did not consent to her 
    eggs being mixed with donor sperm, and did not consent to any spare embryos 
    being used for research purposes.</P>
    <P>d) Mr B consented to his wife's treatment and records that he understood 
    that he would be the father of any resulting child. He consented to his 
    sperm being used to treat his wife. He expressly refused to consent to his 
    sperm being used in treating others or in any research 
  project.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>By a 'mistake' (which I shall call it despite its 
  inadequacy as a description of what occurred), Mr B's sperm were injected into 
  the eggs of Mrs A. She became pregnant with the twins of whom she is the 
  genetic mother and Mr B is the genetic father. None of the four parties 
  involved consented. Mr and Mrs A are both white and, after the birth of the 
  twins, it became apparent that they were children of mixed race. Behind the 
  legal arguments which occupied the court for three days lies a tragic human 
  story of two families trying to come to terms with the consequences of the 
  mistake. It is, however, necessary to engage in the legal arguments because 
  the mistake raises the issue of the status of the children. I respectfully 
  agree with Wilson J who said in <I>U v W (Attorney General Intervening)</I> 
  [1997] 2 FLR 282 at page 303 </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>"….there is a particular need for certainty in provisions affecting 
  status…" </P>
  <P><B>The legislation</B></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>At common law, Mr B has the status of an unmarried 
  father. He would not have parental responsibility by virtue of section 2(2)(b) 
  of the Children Act 1989. The main argument in this case concerns the effect 
  of the 1990 Act on the common law and the Children Act. I turn now to the 
  relevant provisions of the 1990 Act. The preamble sets out the purpose of the 
  legislation </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"An Act to make provision in connection with human embryos and 
    any subsequent development of such embryos; to prohibit certain practices in 
    connection with embryos and gametes; to establish a Human Fertilisation and 
    Embryology Authority; to make provision about the persons who in certain 
    circumstances are to be treated in law as the parents of a child; and to 
    amend the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>A clear purpose of this aspect of the 1990 Act is to 
  make provision for certain persons to be treated as parents. The main question 
  is whether these facts fall within the scope of the 1990 Act so as to give Mr 
  A the status of father of the twins. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>Section 1 describes the meaning of "embryo", 
  "gamete" and associated expressions </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>(1) "In this Act, except where otherwise stated – 
    <P></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) embryo means a live human embryo where fertilisation is

    <P>(2) This Act, so far as it governs bringing about the creation of an 
    embryo, applies only to bringing about the creation of an embryo outside the

    <BLOCKQUOTE>(a) references to embryos the creation of which was brought 
      about <I>in vitro</I> (in their application to those where fertilisation 
      is complete) are to those where fertilisation began outside the human body

    <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) references to embryos taken from a woman do not include 
      embryos whose creation was brought about <I>in vitro</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>(3) This Act, so far as it governs the keeping or use of an embryo, 
    applies only to keeping or using an embryo outside the human body.</P>
    <P>(4) References in this Act to gametes, eggs or sperm, except where 
    otherwise stated, are to live human gametes, eggs or sperm but references 
    below in this Act to gametes or eggs do not include eggs in the process of

    <BLOCKQUOTE>(b) for the purpose of securing that consideration is given to 
      the use of practices not requiring the authority of a licence as well as 
      those requiring such authority.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>Section 27 gives the meaning of 'mother' for the 
  purpose of the 1990 Act. It is section 28, however, which is crucial to the 
  determination of the main issue. It gives the meaning of 'father' for the 
  purpose of the 1990 Act. </A>
  <P></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The whole scheme of the 1990 Act lays great emphasis upon 
    consent. The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth 
    of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life 
    in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before 
    then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical 
    difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of 
    the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only 
    these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians 
    and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has 
    devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating 
    assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between 
    the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to 
    respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of 
    particular individuals caught up in it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>Miss Hamilton pointed out that the 1990 Act and 
  the Code of Practice laid heavy emphasis upon the welfare of the children 
  resulting from treatment and, even if the adults consented, the treatment 
  could not be embarked upon unless account has been taken of the welfare of any 
  resulting child. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Section 28</B></P>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Section 28 potentially applies because this is a 
  case of twins who have been carried by a woman, Mrs A, as the result of the 
  placing in her of an embryo. It is, however, clear to me that the present 
  situation where the sperm of a man has been placed in the eggs of a woman by 
  mistake was not in the minds of those drafting the Bill or in Parliament's 
  mind when it passed section 28. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>Miss Hamilton accepted that the present situation 
  was not contemplated by the legislators, but submitted that the court is not 
  bound to assume that parliamentary counsel could foresee every possibility 
  that might arise. Otherwise, as Arden LJ said in <I>Re S (Freeing for 
  Adoption)</I> [2002] EWCA Civ 798, [2002] 2 FLR 681 at paragraph 37, there 
  would never be any problem of statutory interpretation for the court to 
  resolve. Miss Hamilton suggested that the purpose of this part of the 1990 Act 
  under the umbrella of welfare was to protect children born as a result of 
  treatment. It was designed to prevent the man who donated sperm from 
  attempting to be treated as the father and to ensure that the man who engaged 
  in the treatment process was prepared to accept responsibility for the child 
  of another man. As Miss Hamilton so graphically put it, children need fathers. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Section 28(2)</B></P>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>Looking superficially at section 28(2), it might 
  appear that Mr A could be the legal father of the twins, since, at the time of 
  the placing in Mrs A of the embryo, Mrs A was a party to the marriage with Mr 
  A and the creation of the embryo carried by her was not brought about with the 
  sperm of Mr A. The application of subsection (2), however, is subject to two 
  provisos. The first is contained in section 28(5) and provides for the common 
  law presumption of legitimacy of a child born to a mother during her marriage. 
  In the present case, that presumption is displaced by the DNA tests which 
  established that Mr B is the biological father of the twins. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>The second proviso, contained in subsection (2) 
  itself, is the requirement of the husband's consent. Subsection (2) applies 
  unless it is shown that Mr A "did not consent to … her insemination." It is 
  obvious that section 28 is not relevant if the sperm given by Mr A was used 
  since he is then the biological father and the twins are the legitimate 
  children of Mr and Mrs A. The question is whether Mr A consented to the 
  insemination of Mrs A by a third person (for the purposes of this argument, 'a 
  donor'). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>Miss Hamilton submitted that on strict statutory 
  interpretation Mr and Mrs A came within subsection (2). It was not necessary 
  in the case of a married couple for the husband to give 'effective' or written 
  consent. There was a rebuttable presumption that he had consented. Miss 
  Hamilton argued that Mr A gave a broad consent to the placing of an embryo 
  sufficient to treat him as the father unless it could be shown that Mr A had 
  not consented. He did not raise the issue nor seek to set aside the 
  presumption. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>The insurmountable problem, in my view, to that 
  approach, is the question – to what did he consent? The whole procedure is 
  governed by written consent forms which are filled in and signed by both 
  intended parents after careful discussion and counselling in the clinic. Mr A 
  gave his written consent in the standard form which is at Annex C of the 
  4<SUP>th</SUP> Code of Practice. He consented to the 'course of treatment 
  outlined above', as interpreted in section 2(1). The 'course of treatment' to 
  which he consented was that outlined in Mrs A's consent form. As I set out 
  above, Mrs A consented to her eggs being used and mixed with her husband's 
  sperm. She did not consent to her eggs being mixed with named or anonymous 
  donated sperm. She consented to the placing of not more than two resulting 
  embryos in her uterus. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>Mr A certainly gave his consent to the placing in 
  his wife of 'an embryo'. The embryo actually placed in Mrs A was a 
  fundamentally different embryo from one that might have been created by the 
  use of Mr A's sperm. Mr A has indicated that he does not wish to seek to 
  withdraw his consent and wishes to take advantage of the irrebuttable 
  presumption set out in section 28(2) and become the legal father. It is not, 
  however, a matter of endorsement by the husband of his consent. The question 
  whether the husband consented is a matter of fact which may be ascertained 
  independently of the views of those involved in the process. On the clear 
  evidence provided in the consent forms Mr A plainly did not consent to the 
  sperm of a named or anonymous donor being mixed with his wife's eggs. This was 
  clearly an embryo created without the consent of Mr and Mrs A. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>Miss Hamilton and Mr Francis, on behalf of the NHS 
  Trust, argued that the use of Mr B's sperm for the eggs of Mrs A was by way of 
  a mistake which did not vitiate the meaning of subsection (2). Mr Eadie argued 
  that such a mistake was fatal. I was asked to look at a number of cases where 
  mistakes were held not to be fundamental and a number of other cases where 
  they were. In my judgment, this line of cases does not assist me, since the 
  mixing of the sperm of Mr B with the eggs of Mrs A was not within the 
  contemplation of either family and was entirely contrary to the written 
  consents given by Mr A. This mistake went to the root of the whole process and 
  has had irreparable consequences. The concern of Mr Francis that, if the court 
  found that a fundamental mistake had occurred in this case so as to exclude 
  the application of section 28(2), in cases where there had been trivial errors 
  the application of section 28(2) would also be excluded, is misconceived. 
  Mistakes may well occur during the process for other families undergoing the 
  treatment which may be contrary to the provisions of the 1990 Act but which 
  are not fundamental. In those cases the consent will probably not be vitiated. 
  This mistake was, I hope, exceptional and of an entirely different 
  significance and severity from minor breaches. I am satisfied that, on the 
  proper interpretation of section 28(2) in the absence of any consideration of 
  the Human Rights legislation and its jurisprudence, Mr A did not consent to 
  the placing in his wife of the embryo which was actually placed. Accordingly, 
  section 28(2) does not apply. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Section 28(3)</B></P>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>Miss Hamilton argued that the literal wording of 
  subsection (3) covered the present circumstances. In a situation where no man 
  is treated as the father by virtue of subsection (2), if subsection (3)(a) 
  applied to married men as well as unmarried men and the court was satisfied 
  that Mr and Mrs A were treated together by a person to whom a licence applies, 
  then on a strict statutory interpretation, subsection (3) would apply. She 
  submitted that Wilson J was in error in <I>U v W</I> (above) in holding that 
  subsection (3) applied only to a man who was not married to the woman (see 
  page 291h). Treatment together was a course of conduct and it would be wrong 
  in the context of treatment not to look at the whole enterprise. She urged a 
  robust interpretation of 'treatment together,' in keeping with the approach 
  taken in other decisions of the Court of Appeal and the High Court to which I 
  shall turn below. She recognised that the strict interpretation that she 
  submitted did not sit comfortably with the Code of Practice which clearly 
  presumed a distinction between married men within section 28(2) and unmarried 
  men within section 28(3). A literal interpretation would, however, cover the 
  situation and meet the welfare requirements of the children who saw Mr A as 
  their father. She suggested that, if the facts of this case took it outside 
  section 28, then this part of the Act was incompatible with the Human Rights 
  Act. She suggested that it would be possible for the court to be human rights 
  compliant if her interpretation of subsection (3) was adopted. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>I have found section 28(3) more difficult to 
  interpret than section 28(2). The first question is whether it was intended to 
  apply to husbands or whether it was designed solely to deal with efforts to 
  have children by those who were not married to each other. Subsection (3) 
  requires in the case of the placing of an embryo in the woman that it was 'in 
  the course of treatment provided for her and a man together by a person to 
  whom a licence applies and the creation of the embryo was not brought about 
  with the sperm of that man'. Subsection (2), although limited to husbands, 
  appears to be broader than subsection (3). The husband is to be treated as the 
  father, unless it is shown that he did not consent, that he 'opted out.' In 
  subsection (3) the boot is on the other foot. The acceptance of fatherhood has 
  to be shown. The man has to show commitment and that commitment has to be 
  demonstrated by his active involvement. In other words, he must 'opt in.' 
  Further in subsection (2), in contrast to subsection (3), it does not have to 
  be shown that the husband played an active part in the course of treatment 
  provided for his wife and him together by a person to whom a licence applies. 
  I understand that some treatment under the 1990 Act can be given at home and 
  not by a person to whom a licence applies. Such treatment could not be carried 
  out under subsection (3) (see <I>U v W </I>(above), where the treatment was 
  carried out in Rome). </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>Mr Eadie reminded me that by normal statutory 
  interpretation, the court would expect the Parliamentary draftsman to deal 
  with the larger group before the smaller. Consequently it would be odd for a 
  married man to be covered both by subsection (2) and subsection (3). It would 
  not be necessary for a married man to come within subsection (3) unless it was 
  shown that he had not consented. It is not necessary to show consent in 
  subsection (3) to the use of a sperm donor. There has to be treatment together 
  by the man and the woman. Mr Garnham submitted that Parliament expressly 
  provided in subsection (2) the circumstances in which the husband would not be 
  held to be the father and it would be extraordinary if subsection (3) could 
  nonetheless achieve that effect. He suggested that the better view was that 
  subsection (3) did not cover husbands. I agree with Mr Garnham's final 
  submission and that section 28(3) was not intended to include husbands. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>Since the hearing, I have seen the judgments of 
  the Court of Appeal in <I>re R (a child) </I>19<SUP>th</SUP> February 2003 
  which dealt with section 28(3). I am reassured in my conclusions that section 
  28(3) was not intended to apply to husbands by paragraphs 20 and 21 of the 
  judgment of Hale LJ </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>" We start from the proposition, advanced by Mr Jackson for the 
    child's guardian, that section 28(3) is an unusual provision, conferring the 
    relationship of parent and child on people who are related neither by blood 
    nor by marriage. Conferring such relationships is a serious matter, 
    involving as it does not only the relationship between father and child but 
    also between the whole of the father's family and the child. The rule should 
    only apply to those cases which clearly fall within the footprint of the 
    statutory language. 
    <P></P>
    <P></P>
    <P>The wording of section 28 makes it clear that the time at which the legal 
    paternity is created is the time when the embryo or the sperm and eggs which 
    subsequently result in the birth of the child are placed in the woman. 
    Section 28(2) expressly refers to the mother being married at that time. 
    Section 28(3) expressly refers back to section 28(2) for the purpose of 
    ensuring that the mother's husband is excluded from paternity. This suggests 
    that they both refer to the same time. Section 28(3) also focuses on the act 
    of placing the embryo or sperm and eggs in the mother, further suggesting 
    that the question whether this is done 'in the course of treatment services 
    provide for her and a man together' should be answered at that time and no 
    other." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  to a need to concentrate on the purpose of undergoing treatment. He submitted 
  that if it was found that there was no consent to treatment under subsection

  resulting in the use of the sperm of another in place of the use of sperm of

  relationship with the twins and in so far as she has a right it is derived 
  from her husband. She is, nonetheless, deeply involved in the consequences of 
  the mistake which must be a source of great distress for her. Miss Parker 
  submitted that the twins were the children of her husband and her feelings for 
  her husband would extend to his children and this would engage her right to 
  respect for a family life with them. She has, of course, had no de facto 
  relationship with the twins and, in my judgment, her article 8 rights are not 
  engaged at all. </A>

  <P><B>Mr B</B></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>In view of my decision that sections 28 and 29 of 
  the 1990 Act are not applicable to the facts of this case, a consideration of 
  whether Mr B has rights under article 8(1) is largely academic. All the 
  submissions, except those of Miss Parker on behalf of Mr and Mrs B, emphasised 
  that Mr B did not have a right to respect for family life in relation to the 
  twins. If that submission be wrong, in my judgment, Mr B's alleged article 
  8(1) right has not in any event been infringed since his status as biological 
  father is not to be displaced by the 1990 Act. In case, however, these 
  proceedings go further, I shall give my views briefly. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>Mr B is the biological father of the twins in 
  circumstances in which he has had no opportunity to forge any relationship 
  with them. Although he was clearly not a consenting sperm provider other than 
  in a treatment process with his wife, it is, on the facts of this sad case, 
  only the use of his sperm that connects him with the twins. In <I>M v the 
  Netherlands</I> (1993) 74 D&amp;R 120 the European Commission declared 
  inadmissible a case on somewhat stronger facts than the present. In that case, 
  the biological father agreed to be a sperm donor to a lesbian couple and after 
  the birth of the child visited regularly and babysat on occasions. When he 
  sought greater contact with the child and the couple broke off contact with 
  him, his application to the courts was dismissed. On his application to the 
  European Court, the Commission rejected it out of hand and stated at paragraph 
  1 of the judgment </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Family life …. implies close personal ties in addition to 
    parenthood…The Commission considers that the situation in which a person 
    donates sperm only to enable a woman to become pregnant through artificial 
    insemination does not of itself give the donor a right to respect for family 
    life with the child."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>This was so despite the degree of contact M had 
  had with the child. In this case, although Mr B was not a consenting donor, 
  his contact with the twins has been non-existent. The approach of the 
  Commission in <I>M</I> endorses its earlier decision in <I>K v United 
  Kingdom</I> (1986) 50 D&amp;R 199. That judgment stated at page 207 that 
  family life depends upon </A>

  ties."</BLOCKQUOTE>

  should lead me to a contrary conclusion. In my judgment, <I>Rose</I> can be 
  distinguished. It was a situation of children born by artificial insemination 
  seeking to find their personal paternal identity which was an important part 
  of their genetic makeup. The effect of <I>Rose </I>is limited to confirming 
  the article 8(1) right of a child to establish details of his or her identity. 
  I do not therefore consider that <I>Rose </I>extends the principle to the 
  right of the parent as well as the right of the child. In <I>Mikulic</I>, the 
  issue was the establishing of paternity by a child and the effect upon her 
  personal identity which equally does not have the same effect upon the father. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>Mr B does not have a right to respect for his 
  family life which might have been breached if Mr A had been able to establish 
  his presumption of fatherhood. I do not consider it necessary to go on to 
  consider his right to respect for his private life, which Miss Hamilton 
  accepts exists, since I do not consider it is sufficiently engaged by the 
  issues in this case. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Mrs A and Mr A</B></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>Mrs A is the natural, biological mother of the 
  children and it is beyond argument that her rights under article 8(1) are 
  clearly engaged in this case. Mr A is in the position of the father and has 
  established a close relationship with the twins whom he regards as his 
  children. His rights are therefore also clearly engaged under article 8(1) 
  (see for instance, <I>X Y &amp; Z v United Kingdom </I>(1997) 24 EHRR 263 
  paragraphs 36 and 37). My interpretation of sections 28 and 29 constitutes an 
  interference with those rights of Mr and Mrs A. Mr A has been deprived of the 
  presumption that he is the legal father. Miss Hamilton suggested that the 
  infringement of their rights was not saved by article 8(2) and was incapable 
  of being remedied. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>The questions that I have to consider are: whether 
  it is necessary to try to fit the facts of this case into section 28(2) or 
  (3); whether it is indeed possible to do so; and, if not, whether consequently 
  I am compelled to grant a certificate of incompatibility under section 4 of 
  the Human Rights Act 1998, or whether article 8(2) would apply - in 
  particular, whether there are other legal remedies that would meet the breach 
  of Mr and Mrs A's article 8(1) rights. Miss Hamilton argued that the 
  interference with the rights of Mr and Mrs A could not adequately be met by 
  invoking alternative domestic family remedies. I do not agree with her 
  submission on this issue. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=51><A name=para51>In my judgment it is not necessary to strain the 
  language of section 28(3) to meet the rights of Mr and Mrs A, nor is it 
  necessary to consider the question of incompatibility (see below). Within the 
  domestic family legislation there are remedies which can underpin and protect 
  the position of Mr A with respect to the twins. Those remedies include 
  applications by Mr and Mrs A for section 8 orders under the Children Act 1989, 
  the most immediate of which would be to make a residence order which would 
  give Mr A parental responsibility. I made a residence order to Mr and Mrs A 
  during the hearing of this case. Mr B does not have and cannot obtain parental 
  responsibility without the agreement of Mrs A or a court order under section 4 
  of the Children Act 1989. He is not, as I understand it, seeking to make that 
  application. Mr B is the legal father of children born outside a marriage, and 
  he can therefore make a section 8 application by virtue of section 10(4) of 
  the Children Act. It is clearly a case to remain in the High Court. Such an 
  application, if made, would be decided under the provisions of the Children 
  Act, in which the welfare of the children is paramount (see section 1(1)). 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Adoption</B></P>
  <LI value=52><A name=para52>I recognise that, if sections 28(2) and (3) do not 
  apply to Mr A, there is no legal mechanism that can make him the legal father 
  of the twins unless there is an adoption order. Mr and Mrs A can apply under 
  the Adoption Act 1976 to adopt the twins. Miss Hamilton submitted that there 
  would be an infringement of Mrs A's right if she was obliged to apply with Mr 
  A for an adoption order. She would lose her right to be the natural and legal 
  mother of the twins by becoming their adopted mother. Mr A would lose his 
  right to be regarded as the legal father of the twins under the 1990 Act. She 
  suggested that it could not be assumed that an adoption order would be made. 
  In any event the period up to the conclusion of the adoption proceedings would 
  be stressful and would in itself discriminate against and infringe the human 
  rights of both Mr and Mrs A. She referred to paragraph 55 of the judgment of 
  the European Court in <I>Marckx v Belgium</I> (above). </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=53><A name=para53>In accordance with the Adoption Rules 1984, rule 
  15(3), and the guidance given in decisions such as <I>Re H; Re G </I>(above), 
  the court may direct that any other person be made a respondent to the process 
  and Mr B could be made a respondent in the discretion of the court. As a 
  father without parental responsibility Mr B could not be treated as a parent 
  under section 16(1)(b)(ii) and (2)(b) of the Adoption Act. There would 
  therefore be no statutory opposition to the adoption application and the court 
  would focus solely on its fundamental duty under section 6 of the Adoption Act 
  to promote the welfare of the twins throughout their childhood, and would make 
  an adoption order if it is shown to be in the best interests of the twins to 
  do so. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>In my judgment the interference with the exercise 
  of the rights of Mr and Mrs A under article 8(1) is in accordance with the 
  law. It can properly be cured by the legal remedies available in our domestic 
  law. The interference is necessary in a democratic society and pursues the 
  legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, in this case 
  the twins. It is proportionate in its aim to provide the necessary protection 
  of the twins whose rights and welfare must predominate (see for instance 
  <I>Johansen v Norway</I> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/31.html">(1997) 23 EHRR 33</a>). </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>The Twins</B></P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>Under article 8 a court must consider the position 
  of children under two separate heads, their rights and their welfare. In the 
  present case, the twins' rights and welfare are intertwined. The twins 
  unquestionably have rights (see <I>Marckx v Belgium</I> (above)). They are 
  clearly entitled to respect for their family life with their mother, Mrs A, 
  and with Mr A whom they regard as their father. Through no fault of theirs, 
  they have been born children of mixed race by a mistake which cannot be 
  rectified. Their biological mother and their biological father are not married 
  and cannot marry. They may not be able during their childhood to form any 
  relationship with their biological father. They have inherited two cultures 
  but, in reality, can only gain real benefit from one during their childhood. 
  Of all the parties who have undoubtedly suffered from this mistake, the twins, 
  who at present know nothing of it, have had their human rights most obviously 
  and seriously infringed. Prior to this hearing they had a loving, stable and 
  secure family. Mr A is registered as their father on the birth certificate. 
  The application of sections 28 and 29 would, as Miss Hamilton submitted, give 
  the twins the certainty that Mr A is their legal father. If section 28 applies 
  they would have a complete sense of belonging to Mr A. If section 28 is found 
  not to apply then there is a period of uncertainty which is to their 
  detriment. She suggested that their rights would be infringed by the adoption 
  process and by being given the status of adopted children. They would be 
  different from other donor sperm children and this would underline the mistake 
  which occurred in this case. I agree that it is imperative that their rights 
  and their welfare are secured and protected. In Children Act proceedings their 
  welfare would be the paramount consideration and, similarly, in adoption 
  proceedings the duty of the court would be to promote their welfare throughout 
  their childhood. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>In my judgment the twins' rights to respect for 
  their family life with their mother and Mr A can be met by appropriate family 
  or adoption orders and those orders would be proportionate to the 
  infringements of their rights. The effect of the decision of the court that 
  sections 28 and 29 do not apply to their case does not create any greater 
  difficulty for the twins than the unfortunate circumstances surrounding their 
  conception and birth. Although they lose the immediate certainty of the 
  irrebuttable presumption that Mr A is their legal father, they will remain 
  within a loving, stable and secure home. They also retain the great advantage 
  of preserving the reality of their paternal identity. In <I>Re H and A

  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P>"I do not consider that that factual distinction begins to displace the 
  points of principle to be drawn from the cases: first, that the interests of 
  justice are best served by the ascertainment of the truth and secondly, that 
  the court should be furnished with the best available science and not confined 
  to such unsatisfactory alternatives as presumptions and inferences."</P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>I respectfully agree and am certain that the truth 
  in this case is more important to the rights of the twins and their welfare 
  than a fictional certainty. This is not a sperm donor case and should not be 
  treated as such when considering the position of the twins. To refuse to 
  recognise Mr B as their biological father is to distort the truth about which 
  some day the twins will have to learn through knowledge of their paternal 
  identity. The requirement to preserve the truth will not adversely affect 
  their immediate welfare nor their welfare throughout their childhood. It does 
  not impede the cementing of the permanent relationship of each of them with Mr 
  A who will act as their father throughout their childhood. In my judgment the 
  infringement of the twins' article 8(1) rights is met by the application of 
  article 8(2) and it is proportionate to those rights for this court not to 
  apply section 28(2) or (3). </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Certificate of Incompatibility</B></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=para58>I am entirely satisfied that the issue of 
  potential incompatibility of the 1990 Act with the Human Rights legislation 
  does not arise in respect of any of the parties to these proceedings. As I 
  have set out above, the rights of Mr and Mrs B are not infringed. In relation 
  to the rights of Mr and Mrs A, it would be possible, if I was compelled to do 
  so by my duty to ensure the compatibility of domestic legislation with the 
  Human Rights Act, so to construe section 28(3) as to squeeze into it the 
  present situation and thereby avoid a situation of incompatibility. But more 
  to the point, there are alternative routes through domestic family legislation 
  which can give to Mr and Mrs A adequate protection and relief from the unhappy 
  situation in which they find themselves. The twins require love, security and 
  protection within their existing family, all of which can be ensured by 
  domestic legislation and they do not require, nor would it be to their 
  advantage, for there to be any consideration of incompatibility. </A>
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Conclusion</B></P>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>For all the reasons which I have set out above, I 
  shall not make a declaration that Mr A is the legal father. I shall not make a 
  declaration of incompatibility of the 1990 Act under section 4 of the Human 
  Rights Act. I shall adjourn the application of Mr B under section 55A of the 
  Family Law Act. I shall hear submissions as to whether I should make any other 
  declarations as sought by the NHS Trust or the Authority. </A>
