  <P><B>Mr Justice Munby :</B> </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=1><A name=para1>On 11 November 2003 a wholly deserving father left 
  my court in tears having been driven to abandon his battle for contact with 
  his seven year old daughter D. She was born on 2 August 1996. That battle had 
  lasted for precisely five years. It was on 11 November 1998, a matter of days 
  after the parties separated on 2 November 1998, that mother petitioned for 
  divorce and on the very next day that she began proceedings for a residence 
  order. From almost the moment when the parties separated there were problems 
  about contact. As matters stand today, direct contact has ceased – it has not 
  taken place since 20 October 2001 and father has not even seen his daughter 
  since 1 December 2001. Such indirect contact as is taking place is far from 
  satisfactory. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=2><A name=para2>From father's perspective the last two years of the 
  litigation have been an exercise in absolute futility. His counsel told me 
  that father felt very let down by the system. I was not surprised. I make no 
  apology for repeating here in public what I then said in private: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"He is entitled to. … I can understand why he expresses that 
    view. He has every right to express that view. In a sense it is shaming to 
    have to say it, but I personally agree with his view. It is very, very 
    disheartening. I am sorry there is nothing more I can do."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I also said this:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I think there are lessons to be learned from this and I think 
    this is, if for father a heartbreaking occasion, an opportunity [that] in 
    the wider public interest requires to be seized. … He has nothing, so far as 
    I can see, to reproach himself with. The system has failed him. … I feel 
    desperately, desperately sorry for him. I am very sad that the system is as 
    it is. That is why, as I have said, I am going to give a judgment dealing 
    with the wider aspects of this."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=3><A name=para3>I now hand down this judgment in public as a 
  contribution to what Wall J in <I>A v A</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/142.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/142.html">[2004] EWHC 142 (Fam)</a></A></A> at para [22] referred to as "the ongoing debate about the role 
  of the courts in contact and residence disputes." I repeat what I recently 
  said in <I>Re B, Kent CC v B</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/411.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/411.html">[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)</a></A></A> at para [99]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In my judgment, the workings of the family justice system and, 
    very importantly, the views about the system of the mothers and fathers 
    caught up in it, are, as Balcombe LJ put it in <I>Re W (Wardship: Discharge: 
    Publicity)</I> [1995] 2 FLR 466 at p 474, "matters of public interest which 
    can and should be discussed publicly". Many of the issues litigated in the 
    family justice system require open and public debate in the 
  media."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>And I draw attention to what the President said in the administrative 
  directions that she issued on 28 January 2004 in the wake of the <I>Angela 
  Cannings </I>case (see <I>Re B </I>at para [14]):</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is also worth giving consideration to increasing the 
    frequency with which anonymised family court judgments in general are made 
    public. According to current convention, judgments are usually made public 
    where they involve some important principle of law which in the opinion of 
    the judge makes the case of interest to the law reporters. In view of the 
    current climate and increasing complaints of 'secrecy' in the family justice 
    system, a broader approach to making judgments public may be 
  desirable."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I respectfully, and emphatically, agree.</P>
  <LI value=4><A name=para4>Those who are critical of our family justice system 
  may well see this case as exemplifying everything that is wrong with the 
  system. I can understand such a view. The melancholy truth is that this case 
  illustrates all too uncomfortably the failings of the system. There is much 
  wrong with our system and the time has come for us to recognise that fact and 
  to face up to it honestly. If we do not we risk forfeiting public confidence. 
  The newspapers – and I mean newspapers generally, for this is a theme taken up 
  with increasing emphasis by all sectors of the press – make uncomfortable 
  reading for us. They suggest that confidence is already ebbing away. We ignore 
  the media at our peril. We delude ourselves if we dismiss the views of 
  journalists as unrepresentative of public opinion or as representative only of 
  sectors of public opinion we think we can ignore. Responsible voices are 
  raised in condemnation of our system. We need to take note. We need to act. 
  And we need to act now. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=5><A name=para5>I have handed down, in private, judgments dealing 
  with those aspects of the case that ought to remain private. I now hand down 
  this further judgment in public. I have anonymised it so that the parties will 
  not be identified or in any way traceable. For that reason, because to name 
  them would reveal where the parties come from, I have also anonymised the 
  District Judges and Circuit Judges who dealt with this case in the County 
  Court before it was transferred up to the High Court. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=6><A name=para6>The history is most conveniently set out in tabular 
  form, attached as an Annexe to this judgment. The Annexe is long but I make no 
  apologies for that. The history of the case is long – too long – and it is 
  important that those who wish to ponder the implications of this judgment 
  should have available to them proper details of what has happened. In due 
  course I shall return to the Annexe in order to draw from it the lessons that 
  I believe need to be learnt. But first I must flesh out in a little more 
  detail some of the salient features of the litigation. What follows is taken 
  in large part from the two judgments that I have given in private. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=7><A name=para7>This case raises issues some of which have recently 
  been considered by Wall J (as he then was) in three important judgments: <I>Re 
  M (Intractable Contact Dispute: Interim Care Order) </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2003/1024.html">[2003] EWHC 1024 (Fam)</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2003/1024.html">[2003] 2 FLR 636</a>, <I>Re O (A Child)</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2003/3031.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2003/3031.html">[2003] EWHC 3031 (Fam)</a></A></A> and <I>A v A</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/142.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/142.html">[2004] EWHC 142 (Fam)</a></A></A>. <I>Re O </I>received much publicity, not all of it accurate. 
  Wall J's three judgments require to be read together. Not merely do they 
  contain a number of immensely valuable and important insights and lessons 
  which are of general application; they neatly illustrate three different types 
  of what are conventionally called intractable contact disputes. At the risk of 
  some over-simplification it can be seen that in <I>Re M </I>it was the mother 
  who was primarily responsible for the problems, in <I>Re O </I>it was the 
  father, and in <I>A v A </I>both parents shared the responsibility. The cases 
  also illuminatingly illustrate different techniques for attempting to resolve 
  disputes of this kind. In all three cases the mother was the residential 
  parent. In <I>Re M </I>residence was transferred to the father by means of an 
  interim care order followed in due course by a residence order; in <I>Re O 
  </I>the father's contact was stopped; in <I>A v A </I>a joint residence order 
  was made. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=8><A name=para8>I agree entirely with everything said by Wall J in 
  those three cases. I wish, however, to emphasise two points in particular and 
  I can do no better than to repeat what he said in <I>Re O</I>. The first is 
  the vitally important point he made at para [6] in a passage endorsed by the 
  President in <I>Re S (a child) (contact)</I> <A 
  href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/18.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/18.html">[2004] EWCA Civ 18</a></A></A>, [2004] 1 FCR 439, at para [23]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The courts recognise the critical importance of the role of 
    both parents in the lives of their children. The courts are not anti-father 
    and pro-mother or vice versa. The court's task, imposed by Parliament in 
    section 1 of the Children Act 1989 in every case is to treat the welfare of 
    the child or children concerned as paramount, and to safeguard and promote 
    the welfare of every child to the best of its ability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Unless there are cogent reasons against it, the children of 
    separated parents are entitled to know and have the love and society of both 
    their parents. In particular, the courts recognise the vital importance of 
    the role of non-resident fathers in the lives of their children, and only 
    make orders terminating contact when there is no alternative."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>As the President said in <I>Re S </I>at para [19], "mothers and … fathers 
  have equal rights before the court." That, of course, is true, and it is a 
  message that needs to be repeated and understood. But what is also true is 
  that there are far more non-resident fathers than non-resident mothers. As the 
  President acknowledged in <I>Re S </I>at para [20], </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In practice, after separation, the majority of children remain 
    with the mother who is, for that reason, the more likely parent to seek a 
    residence order. The father is, for the same reason, the more likely parent 
    to seek a contact order." </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>So that when the system fails – and fail it does – it is disproportionately 
  fathers and not mothers who find themselves, as well as the children, the 
  victims of that failure.</P>
  <LI value=9><A name=para9>The second point is that made by Wall J when he went 
  on to say: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The court system for dealing with contact disputes has serious 
    faults, which were identified and addressed in Chapter 10 of the report of 
    the Children Act Sub-Committee (CASC) of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory 
    Board entitled <I>Making Contact Work</I>. … In particular, the court 
    process is stressful for both parents and children, it is expensive for 
    those who are not publicly funded; it is slow and adversarial. It tends to 
    entrench parental attitudes rather than encouraging them to change. It is 
    ill adapted to dealing with the difficult human dilemmas involved, notably 
    when it comes to the enforcement of its orders. </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Parents must, however, take their share of responsibility for 
    the state of affairs they have created. Blaming the system, as the father 
    does in this case, is no answer. He must shoulder his share of the 
    responsibility for the state of affairs he has helped to bring about. All 
    the evidence is that he has proved incapable of doing so."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>He elaborated these points at paras [86]-[87]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In Paragraphs 10.35 to 10.43 of <I>Making Contact Work</I>, 
    CASC set out trenchant criticisms of the court process. I resile from none 
    of them, although both through the <I>Protocol for Judicial Case Management 
    in Public Law Children Act Cases</I> and in the application of its 
    principles to contact and residence disputes the question of judicial 
    continuity has been vigorously addressed. But I adhere in particular to the 
    conclusions contained in paragraphs 10.37 and 10.39, namely: - </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>10.37 The court procedures are too slow. There is insufficient 
      court time and a lack of resources: cases take too long to come to court. 
      There are substantial delays which are detrimental to children and their 
      parents.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>10.39 The litigation process is adversarial and 
      counter-productive. It entrenches attitudes rather than encouraging them 
      to modify. It tends to focus on the arguments of the parents, not the 
      needs of the child. It puts particular pressure on the divided loyalties 
      of children.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>In so far as the father's complaints echo the conclusions of 
    <I>Making Contact Work</I> I am, of course, sympathetic to them. But it is 
    not enough to blame the system, particularly where a substantial share of 
    the responsibility for contact breakdown lies at the door of the parent who 
    complains that the system is the cause of all his ills … parents must take 
    their share of responsibility for the state of affairs they have 
  created."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The President made much the same point in <I>Re S </I>at para [28].</P>
  <LI value=10><A name=para10>All that is true. But it nonetheless needs to be 
  recognised that there are cases, and the present case in my judgment is one, 
  where a parent is entitled to blame the system. Wall J's observations in <I>Re 
  O </I>were made in the context of a case where, as he made clear, the father 
  who was so critical of the system was the very parent who (see at para [83]) 
  had made allegations against the other that were "without foundation … 
  manifestly unsustainable, indeed absurd" and who had proved himself, as Wall J 
  put it, incapable of shouldering his share of the responsibility for the state 
  of affairs he had helped to bring about. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=11><A name=para11>Some – it may, for all I know, be many – of the 
  fathers who are so critical of the system have only themselves to blame for 
  the predicament in which they and their children find themselves and seek 
  unfairly and inappropriately to turn their feelings of frustration and anger 
  into criticism of the system. But the anger which some fathers display to the 
  system cannot simply be put down to "the rage of Caliban seeing his own face 
  in the glass". Some – in the nature of things I cannot know how many but I 
  fear it is too many for comfort – have every justification for their feelings. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=12><A name=para12>I agree with Wall J that there are instances where 
  mothers deliberately alienate children to prevent contact taking place, though 
  like him I prefer Drs Sturge and Glaser's concept of 'implacable hostility' to 
  so-called 'parental alienation syndrome': see <I>Re O </I>at paras [91]-[92], 
  referring to Sturge &amp; Glaser <I>Contact and Domestic Violence – the 
  Experts' Court Report</I> [2000] Fam Law 615 at p 622. As Wall J said, 
  "Parental alienation is a well recognised phenomenon." Indeed, as he went on 
  to point out, <I>Re M </I>was a clear case of parental alienation. Unhappily, 
  in my judgment, the court process does not always prove equal to the task of 
  dealing with such cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=13><A name=para13>In the present case there has been some criticism 
  of father. But these criticisms of father, comparatively trivial when placed 
  in the wider context, do not begin to address the reality of the present 
  unhappy situation. It needs to be said clearly and firmly: the primary, indeed 
  the overwhelming, responsibility for all this lies at mother's door, and 
  mother's door alone. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=14><A name=para14>This is a father who, as the Circuit Judge said in 
  2001 (and I entirely agree), </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"has been consistent and sincere in his wish for contact with 
    [D] in spite of frustrations which have in the past on occasion adversely 
    affected his judgment … in general he is a genuine and sincere father who 
    loves [D], and has her interests very much at heart. He seeks contact 
    because he loves [D], and he knows that this is in her best interest. In my 
    judgment he is right."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=15><A name=para15>This is a father who was described by a Consultant 
  Clinical Psychologist in February 2001, in words with which I also agree, as 
  follows: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Psychologically, [father] presented as a balanced, fairly 
    well-integrated man who could acknowledge both his own deficits as well as 
    reflect on his past behaviour and consider errors, misjudgements and 
    misdemeanours. His view of others was equally balanced; he had no difficulty 
    in adopting another's perspective and could easily acknowledge alternative 
    viewpoints and alternative hypotheses. If his view was challenged, he was 
    able to reflect on the premise and then give a considered response. Overall, 
    his presentation did not indicate a defensiveness. In general, he presented 
    as an emotionally warm and caring man. …</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>It is noted that [father] is sensitive, responsive and creative 
    in his play with [D]; … [D] was completely absorbed and happily engrossed in 
    play with her father … I found [father]'s interactions with [D] to be 
    indicative of a warm caring relationship where there was clear evidence on 
    his part of emotional sensitivity, reciprocity with [D], and appropriate 
    attunement. This indicates a secure parent-child relationship, and that [D] 
    has indeed already formed a strong, significant attachment to her father 
    which will endure despite contact irregularities. …</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>His sensitive care of [D] and the high quality of his 
    interactions with [D] at contact, particularly given long periods of 
    separation and the high conflict context of these contact sessions, lend 
    weight to a view that [father]'s contact with [D] is impressive in it 
    qualities and is clearly rewarding for this child."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=16><A name=para16>A consent order providing for weekly unsupervised 
  contact every Saturday from 10am to 5.45pm was made on 27 November 1998. But 
  as early as 1 April 1999 the difficulties were such that the father was driven 
  to apply for a penal notice. By 26 April 2000 matters had got so bad that on 
  that day mother was given a suspended sentence of seven days' imprisonment by 
  a Circuit Judge. On 20 February 2001 she was given an immediate sentence of 
  fourteen days' imprisonment by another Circuit Judge for what he described as 
  "flagrant breach of court orders". In a judgment which the same Circuit Judge 
  gave on 31 August 2001 he characterised the mother's behaviour as follows: 
</A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>" … mother was obstructive towards contact and gave numerous 
    unreasonable excuses why it was not appropriate to make [D] available for 
    contact … mother constantly disobeyed contact orders from the court … The 
    mother has in the past disobeyed many court orders and her objections to 
    contact appear intractable. It was only following the drastic step of being 
    sent to prison that she complied … Sadly, [mother's] view about [father] is 
    intractable … "</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=17><A name=para17>To that succinct summary I need only add that 
  amongst the many such excuses put forward by the mother one finds groundless 
  assertions that D was ill, that D was frightened by the father's chastisement 
  of her, that D was forcibly fed by her father, that father had threatened not 
  to return her after contact, to take her away from the mother and to remove 
  her from the jurisdiction, and that he had repeatedly broken the agreed 
  contact arrangements. All those allegations, I emphasise, were groundless. 
  Conspicuously absent, also, I should point out, are any judicial findings 
  supporting mother's allegations of domestic violence. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=18><A name=para18>Even after the Circuit Judge had given that 
  judgment, mother continued to put forward threadbare excuses to justify her 
  continued obstruction of contact. The last contact, as I have said, took place 
  on 20 October 2001. The contact planned for 26 October 2001 was sabotaged by 
  mother. I need not set out the details. It suffices for present purposes to 
  repeat what I said in my judgment of 18 February 2003: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"That was sabotage, even if sabotage by deliberate and 
    meaningful silence rather than by expressed words. Moreover I have no doubt 
    that [D]'s behaviour on this occasion was brought about by mother. [D] had 
    clearly enjoyed contact on the two previous weekends. Why on earth should 
    she not want to see her father again? It can only have been because of what 
    mother was saying or doing. In the nature of things I cannot know what goes 
    on between mother and [D] when they are at home together. But it is obvious 
    that mother, even if she was not actively poisoning [D]'s mind against her 
    father, was wholly unable to conceal from [D] her own antipathy to father 
    and her own resistance to the very idea of contact. For this grave breach of 
    her duty – not so much to the father and to the court: much more to [D] – 
    mother bears a heavy responsibility."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=19><A name=para19>The final incident took place on 1 December 2001, 
  the last occasion that father has even seen his daughter. Father behaved most 
  foolishly and in a way which I am sure he has come to regret bitterly. But 
  mother needs to ask herself why father behaved in that way. The plain answer 
  is that it was her constant sabotage of contact that had goaded him beyond 
  endurance. But for her endless prevarications, wrigglings and obstruction of 
  contact the incident on 1 December 2001 would never have taken place. For 
  father it was simply the last straw – and whatever it was that made him lose 
  his temper it was something pretty trivial. But father would have had to be a 
  saint not to have acted otherwise. It may have been father who made the first 
  overt move but, overwhelmingly, it is mother who carries the responsibility – 
  the legal, parental and moral responsibility – for what happened on that 
  occasion. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=20><A name=para20>I repeat what I said in February 2003: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"This is not a case of 'six of one: half a dozen of the other'. 
    I am not of course suggesting that father is either faultless or blameless; 
    but the fact, as I have already said, is that in this case it is mother who 
    is overwhelmingly responsible for the predicament in which [D] and her 
    father now find themselves. I simply refuse to accept that there is any 
    equivalence – legal, moral, parental, or in any other respect – between a 
    father who is "entrenched and rigid" in his desire to have the contact which 
    everyone other than the mother thinks he should have with his daughter and a 
    mother who is "entrenched and rigid" in her opposition to that contact. What 
    is this father supposed to do? Just walk away from the problem – walk away 
    from his daughter – in the faint hope that perhaps if he does not press for 
    contact something will happen? Surely not! Is he to be criticised for 
    continuing to invoke what thus far has proved to be the wholly inadequate 
    assistance of the court? Certainly not! He would, in my judgment, be fully 
    justified if he believed as a responsible and loving father that the time 
    for appeasing mother has come to an end."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=21><A name=para21>I return to the Annexe. What does the history of 
  this litigation show? There are various features which, if perhaps present 
  here in more than usually concentrated form, characterise far too many such 
  cases. Let me identify some of the most significant: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) First, there is the sheer length of the proceedings: five 
    years. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) Secondly, there is the large number of hearings and the 
    astonishing number of different judges who have been involved. There were 43 
    hearings conducted by 16 different judges: nine hearings were before five 
    different District Judges, 25 hearings were before no fewer than seven 
    different Circuit Judges, and a further nine hearings were before four 
    different High Court Judges. It is true that one Circuit Judge conducted 
    nine hearings, another Circuit Judge five hearings, and another Circuit 
    Judge four hearings, as I did also. But as against that modest degree of 
    judicial continuity it has to be noted that two judges conducted only three 
    hearings, five judges only two hearings and a further five judges only one 
    hearing each. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>iii) Thirdly there is the vast bulk of the evidence filed down 
    the years. The parents' evidence (including exhibits) filed during the 
    period down to the hearing before the Circuit Judge on 31 August 2001 ran to 
    some 165 pages; since then there has been more than 400 further pages. The 
    expert evidence runs to 388 pages. A total of more than 950 pages! This 
    almost ceaseless proliferation of paper is in large measure the product of 
    delay: every time the case is adjourned, further reports and more evidence 
    are required to ensure that the court is kept up-to-date. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>iv) Fourthly, there is the matter to which the father drew 
    attention in his application dated 9 November 1999, as well he might: the 
    fact that the case had been listed for a final hearing in respect of 
    residence on 30 June, 12 July, 27 September and 28 October 1999 but, as he 
    complained, "on each occasion it has been adjourned by the Court." He 
    pointed out, with what might be thought studied moderation, that he was 
    being afforded very limited contact with his daughter and that this was 
    "prejudicial to my continued parenting of my daughter." Little good this 
    seems to have done him. Final hearings listed on 19 January, 29 June and 5 
    July 2000 and on the first available date after 16 March 2001 were all 
    adjourned. The final hearing which had initially been fixed for 30 June 1999 
    did not in the event take place until 28 August 2001. It led to the judgment 
    delivered on 31 August 2001 from which I have already quoted. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>v) Fifthly, and linked with the previous point, there is the 
    great delay before the court got round to making findings in relation to the 
    mother's various allegations against the father. Allegations that turned out 
    to be wholly groundless, and which could and should have been resolved at a 
    very much earlier stage, were not judicially determined until August 2001. 
    Allegations of domestic violence that surfaced in October 2000, and which I 
    strongly suspect were either groundless or greatly exaggerated, have never 
    been the subject of any judicial determination. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>vi) Sixthly, there is the great delay in seeking assistance from 
    any expert other than the Court Welfare Officer. True a Consultant Clinical 
    Psychologist produced, in accordance with directions given on 15 December 
    2000, a report – a very valuable report – on 2 February 2001. But only on 31 
    August 2001 was the step taken of involving an independent social worker 
    with the remit of facilitating the implementation of overnight contact. That 
    was after the final hearing had taken place, well over two years after the 
    contact arrangements had plainly run into difficulties and sixteen months 
    after the suspended committal order. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>vii) Seventhly, there is the even longer delay that took place 
    before an order was made on 26 March 2002 for the appointment of a 
    children's guardian. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>viii) Finally, although this point is in fact absolutely central 
    to the father's complaints, there is the characteristic judicial response 
    when difficulties with contact emerged: reduce the amount of contact and 
    replace unsupervised with supervised contact. The original consent order 
    made on 27 November 1998 provided for the father to have over seven hours 
    unsupervised contact each weekend. Difficulties emerge: in plain language, 
    the mother obstructs contact. On 7 June 1999 the contact is reduced to two 
    hours at a contact centre. On 19 January 2000, and again on 12 April 2000, 
    orders are made providing for unsupervised contact for three hours. Mother 
    obstructs contact. On 26 April 2000 a suspended committal order is made. On 
    12 May 2000 the contact is again reduced to two hours at a contact centre. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=22><A name=para22>Seen from a father's perspective, a case such as 
  this exhibits three particularly concerning features: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) the appalling delays of the court system, exacerbated by the 
    absence of any meaningful judicial continuity, seemingly endless directions 
    hearings, the lack of any overall timetable, and the failure of the court to 
    adhere to such timetable as has been set; 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) the court's failure to get to grips with the mother's 
    (groundless) allegations; and 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>iii) the court's failure to get to grips with the mother's 
    defiance of its orders, the court's failure to enforce its own orders. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=23><A name=para23>The frustration this engenders is exemplified by 
  the comment of a father in another case that came before me recently: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I welcomed an independent investigation [by a child 
    psychologist] because for so many years many Judges have heard aspects of 
    the situation but at no time has anyone sought to verify the truth of the 
    situation … Each time the matter is heard relevant past facts do not get 
    presented and the Court's limited time is taken up with the initiating of 
    procedural matters rather than a consideration of the facts of the 
  case."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=24><A name=para24>Seen from a judicial perspective there are two 
  further particularly concerning features of such cases: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) The all too frequent response to any significant problem with 
    contact: list the matter for further directions; reduce contact in the 
    meantime; obtain expert reports; direct the filing of further evidence – all 
    of which produces only further delay which, in turn, exacerbates the 
    difficulties and leads eventually to a situation which may be irretrievable. 

    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) The fact that too often in such cases we only wake up to the 
    fact that the case is intractable when it is too late for any effective 
    intervention. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=25><A name=para25>It is convenient at this point to remind ourselves 
  what the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg has to say on these 
  topics. I list in chronological sequence what are for present purposes the 
  most important decisions: <I>Hokkanen v Finland </I>(1994) 19 EHRR 139, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1994/32.html">[1996] 1 FLR 289</a>, <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania </I>(2000) 31 EHRR 212, <I>Nuutinen v 
  Finland </I>(2000) 34 EHRR 358, <I>Glaser v United Kingdom </I>(2000) 33 EHRR 
  1, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/419.html">[2001] 1 FLR 153</a>, <I>Hoppe v Germany </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/799.html">[2003] 1 FLR 384</a>, <I>Sylvester v

  <P></P>
  <LI value=26><A name=para26>This is not the place for any detailed exposition 
  of the Strasbourg case-law. It suffices for present purposes if I merely 
  extract a few of the most important points that emerge from the authorities. 
  The first is the principle, long recognised, that, as it was put in 
  <I>Kosmopoulou v Greece </I>at para [47]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other's 
    company constitutes a fundamental element of family life, even if the 
    relationship between the parents has broken down, and domestic measures 
    hindering such enjoyment amount to an interference with the right protected 
    by Article 8 of the Convention."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Article 8, of course, protects not merely the father's right to contact 
  with his daughter but also her right to contact with her father.</P>
  <LI value=27><A name=para27>The second is the principle, also long recognised 
  and most recently stated in <I>Hoppe v Germany </I>at para [54], that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"in cases concerning a person's relationship with his or her 
    child, there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk 
    that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the 
    matter."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>As the Court said in <I>Glaser v United Kingdom </I>at para [93]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is … essential that custody and contact cases be dealt with 
    speedily."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>And as the Court said in <I>Sylvester v Austria </I>at para [69]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"the court reiterates that effective respect for family life 
    requires that future relations between parent and child not be determined by 
    the mere effluxion of time."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=28><A name=para28>The third is the principle that in private law 
  cases, just as much as in public law cases, Article 8 includes what was 
  described in <I>Hokkanen v Finland </I>at para [55] as: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"a right for the parent to have measures taken with a view to 
    his or her being reunited with the child and an obligation for the national 
    authorities to take such action."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Court has repeatedly stressed that, as part of their "obligation … to 
  take measures to facilitate contact by a non-custodial parent", national 
  authorities "must do their utmost to facilitate" co-operation between the 
  parents: see <I>Hokkanen v Finland </I>at para [58], <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v 
  Romania </I>at para [94], <I>Nuutinen v Finland </I>at para [128], <I>Glaser v 
  United Kingdom </I>at para [66], <I>Hansen v Turkey </I>at para [98] and 
  <I>Kosmopoulou v Greece </I>at para [45].</P>
  <LI value=29><A name=para29>The fourth is the general principle enunciated in 
  <I>Hornsby v Greece </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1997/15.html">(1997) 24 EHRR 250</a> at para [40] and reiterated in 
  <I>Immobiliare Saffi v Italy </I>(1999) 30 EHRR 756 at paras [63], [66]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"[63] … the right to a court would be illusory if a Contracting 
    State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to 
    remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable 
    that Article 6(1) should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded 
    to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without 
    protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 
    as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of 
    proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the 
    principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to 
    respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by 
    any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the "trial" for 
    the purposes of Article 6.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>[66] … the right to a court as guaranteed by Article 6 also 
    protects the implementation of final, binding judicial decisions, which, in 
    States that accept the rule of law, cannot remain inoperative to the 
    detriment of one party. Accordingly, the execution of a judicial decision 
    cannot be unduly delayed."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=30><A name=para30>These positive obligations extend in principle to 
  the taking of coercive measures not merely against the recalcitrant parent but 
  even against the children. As the Court said in <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania 
  </I>at para [106]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Although coercive measures towards children are far from 
    desirable in such sensitive matters, sanctions should not be ruled out where 
    the parent living with the children acts unlawfully."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Court reiterated this in <I>Hansen v Turkey </I>at para [106]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Although measures against children obliging them to re-unite 
    with one or other parent are not desirable in this sensitive area, such 
    action must not be ruled out in the event of non-compliance or unlawful 
    behaviour by the parent with whom the children live."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=31><A name=para31>But the Court has also consistently recognised 
  that, as it was put in <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania </I>at para [94], </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"any obligation to apply coercion can only be limited since the 
    interests, rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, 
    and more particularly the best interests of the child and [his or her] 
    rights under Article 8 of the Convention."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This was elaborated in <I>Kosmopoulou v Greece </I>at para [45]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"the national authorities' obligation to take measures to 
    facilitate reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with 
    children who have lived for some time with the other parent may not be able 
    to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken. 
    The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances 
    of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned is 
    always an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their 
    utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in 
    this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and 
    freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly 
    the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the 
    Convention. Where contact with the parent might appear to threaten those 
    interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities 
    to strike a fair balance between them."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=32><A name=para32>The test was set out in <I>Sylvester v Austria 
  </I>at paras [59]-[60]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"[59] In cases concerning the enforcement of decisions in the 
    realm of family law, the court has repeatedly found that what is decisive is 
    whether the national authorities have taken all the necessary steps to 
    facilitate execution as can reasonably be demanded in the special 
    circumstances of each case. In examining whether non-enforcement of a court 
    order mounted to a lack of respect for the applicants' family life the court 
    must strike a fair balance between the interests of all persons concerned 
    and the general interest in ensuring respect for the rule of law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>[60] In cases of this kind the adequacy of a measure is to be 
    judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can 
    have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the 
    parent who does not live with him or her."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This was repeated in <I>Kosmopoulou v Greece </I>at para [47]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In examining whether the non-enforcement of the access 
    arrangements amounted to a lack of respect for the applicant's family life 
    the Court must strike a balance between the various interests involved, 
    namely the interests of the applicant's daughter, those of the applicant 
    herself and the general interest in ensuring respect for the rule of 
  law."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>It reflects what the Court had earlier said in <I>Glaser v United Kingdom 
  </I>at para [66]:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The key consideration is whether [the national] authorities 
    have taken all necessary steps to facilitate contact as can reasonably be 
    demanded in the special circumstances of each case. Other important factors 
    in proceedings concerning children are that time takes on a particular 
    significance as there is always a danger that any procedural delay will 
    result in the de facto determination of the issue before the court, and that 
    the decision-making procedure provides requisite protection of parental 
    interests."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=33><A name=para33>Furthermore, the national authorities cannot 
  shelter behind an applicant's lack of action: see <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v 
  Romania </I>at para [111]. For, as the Court put it in <I>Sylvester v Austria 
  </I>at para [71]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"an applicant's omission cannot absolve the authorities from 
    their obligations in the matter of execution, since it is they who exercise 
    public authority."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=34><A name=para34>This last point requires some elaboration. It is 
  to be noted (as observed by Professor Gillian Douglas in her comment on the 
  case in [2003] Fam Law 639) that, as defined by the Court in <I>Sylvester v 
  Austria</I>, the obligation on the state to enforce its own court orders is 
  more onerous that had previously been suggested in <I>Glaser v United Kingdom 
  </I>at para [70]. Professor Douglas correctly pointed out that 
  <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania </I>and <I>Sylvester v Austria </I>were both 
  cases in which the delays complained about arose in the context of proceedings 
  under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
  Abduction. She speculated as to whether the Court had thus been "influenced by 
  the summary nature of abduction proceedings" or whether the Court's approach 
  was in fact "a general one regarding delays in family matters, rather than one 
  focussed exclusively on the special nature of abduction cases." She went on to 
  suggest that if the latter view turned out to be correct then there might be 
  significant implications for our domestic practice. In fact the matter has 
  since been resolved by the Court which, in <I>Hansen v Turkey </I>at para 
  [107], reiterated in a non-Hague Convention case the approach it had earlier 
  adopted in both <I>Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania </I>and <I>Sylvester v 
  Austria</I>. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=35><A name=para35>Not least in the light of the Strasbourg 
  jurisprudence there is no room for complacency about the way in which we 
  handle these cases. The Court of Appeal has sounded the wake-up call. As 
  Thorpe LJ said in <I>Re T (Contact: Alienation: Permission to Appeal) 
  </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1736.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 1736</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1736.html">[2003] 1 FLR 531</a>, at para [25]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I reject [counsel's] dismissive submission that the Strasbourg 
    cases add nothing to the domestic jurisprudence. Those cases as they stand 
    suggest that the methods and levels of investigation that our courts have 
    conventionally adopted when trying out issues of alienation may not meet the 
    standards that Arts 6 and 8 … require. There are policy issues here that the 
    Government and the judiciary may need to consider 
  collaboratively."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The general force of this observation is in no way diminished by the fact 
  that two of the Strasbourg cases referred to by Thorpe LJ (the decisions of 
  the Fourth Section of the Court in <I>Sahin v Germany </I>(2001) 36 EHRR 765,

  <LI value=36><A name=para36>In my judgment the two great vices of our present 
  system are: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) that the system is, for all practical purposes, still almost 
    exclusively court based; and 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) that the court's procedures are not working, and not working 
    as speedily and efficiently, as they could be and therefore as they should 
    be. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Let me deal with these two points in turn.</P>
  <LI value=37><A name=para37>As Wall J said in <I>Re O </I>at para [6], 
  "contact disputes are best resolved outside the court system." I emphatically 
  agree. And, as he went on to point out, <I>Making Contact Work </I>identified 
  a number of ways in which this could be achieved. Some of these, as <I>Making 
  Contact Work </I>made clear, require legislation; others, although not 
  requiring legislation, require what was described as "significant additional 
  funding". Although there are now signs that things are moving – in December 
  2003 the Department of Constitutional Affairs published <I>The Final Report of 
  the Child Contact Facilitation and Enforcement Group </I>and on 19 March 2004 
  the Department of Constitutional Affairs and the Department for Education and 
  Skills announced pilot schemes for mediation – the response from Government 
  has hitherto been slow and disappointing. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=38><A name=para38>In April 2003 an independent organisation, New 
  Approaches to Contact, held a seminar, chaired by Bracewell J, to unveil the 
  exciting proposals contained in <I>Contact Dispute Resolution: Early 
  Interventions – Towards a Pilot Project</I>. Reflecting experience in the 
  United States of America, particularly in Florida, NATC proposed a system 
  under which: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) On issue of proceedings the parents are diverted into a 
    non-court process involving (a) court-issued information, (b) parent 
    education and (c) contact-focussed mandatory mediation. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) Residual cases where agreement has not been reached re-enter 
    the court system and are streamed into two categories: (a) non-serious cases 
    admitting of rapid disposal and (b) serious cases which are given increased 
    attention. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>One of the advantages of such a system is that the number of cases 
  requiring significant judicial input can be substantially reduced, enabling 
  more court time to be devoted to those cases – which will, moreover, have been 
  identified at an early stage – requiring greater judicial input. At the end of 
  the seminar, and referring to NATC's proposals, Bracewell J said that "a pilot 
  scheme … has my strong support … this is the way forward." I wholeheartedly 
  agree. There is, I believe, much we can learn from our trans-Atlantic 
  cousins.</P>
  <LI value=39><A name=para39>In <I>Re S </I>at para [12] the President said 
  this: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Recent proposals, supported by the Government, have been made 
    to promote pilot projects for early intervention which it is hoped will 
    encourage parents to resolve their differences over their children before 
    any court hearing. Such initiatives are much to be welcomed."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>That was said before the Government announced its most recent proposals. 
  Some will be disappointed – and I can understand why – that the Government's 
  very recently announced pilot scheme proposals only encourage the use of 
  mediation and do not make it mandatory. </P>
  <LI value=40><A name=para40>The sooner we can get to a situation where as many 
  contact disputes as possible are removed from the court-room setting the 
  better. But, however great the financial and other resources that may be made 
  available for non-court methods of contact dispute resolution, the courts will 
  inevitably continue to have a major role to play. How can the courts' 
  procedures be improved? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=41><A name=para41>There are no simple solutions. There are no 
  panaceas. What may be the appropriate solution in one case may be wholly 
  inappropriate in another superficially similar case. I entirely agree with 
  Wall J's comment in <I>Re O </I>at para [6] that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Disputes between separated parents over contact to their 
    children are amongst the most difficult and sensitive cases which judges and 
    magistrates have to hear. Nobody should pretend that they are easy, or that 
    there is any one size fits all solution."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Thus Wall J was careful to emphasise in <I>Re M </I>that use of the section 
  37 procedure is not a panacea (see at para [7]) and to make the same point in 
  <I>A v A </I>when he made clear at para [24] that shared residence orders, 
  although they have their place and may be an invaluable tool in the right 
  case, are likewise not a panacea. As he observed in <I>Re M </I>at para [11], 
  "each case is different, and what fits one may not fit another."</P>
  <LI value=42><A name=para42>Recognising all this, there are nonetheless a 
  number of things that can, and I believe must, be done, and done as a matter 
  of urgency. I focus here on what the judges can do themselves, and do, I 
  emphasise, without either legislation or additional funding. What is needed – 
  all that is needed – is a protocol supported by a President's Practice 
  Direction. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=43><A name=para43>There is, I believe, merit in the courts adopting 
  a twin-tracking approach: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) The simpler and more straightforward cases should be put on a 
    fast track, where the overall court timetable is measured in weeks rather 
    than months. In dealing with fast-track cases, even if they have entered the 
    system in the County Court, greater use should be made of the skill and 
    expertise of the lay justices and District Judges (Magistrates) who sit in 
    the Family Proceedings Courts. The FPCs are an invaluable and, at least in 
    private law cases, a seriously under-used resource. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) The more serious and complex cases should be allocated to 
    what for want of a better expression, and borrowing from the CPR, I will 
    call the multi-track, where the overall timetable, even if it cannot be 
    measured in weeks must at least be measured in months rather than years. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>It could perhaps be the responsibility of the District Judge in the County 
  Court to allocate every private law case to the appropriate track and, where 
  appropriate, transfer fast track cases down to the FPC. </P>
  <LI value=44><A name=para44>What can be done to improve the handling of 
  multi-track cases? </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=45><A name=para45>The first thing is to tackle the problem of delay. 
  The delays in the present case were scandalous. No case of this kind should 
  take anything remotely approaching five years to resolve. It is almost 
  impossible to see how such a timescale can ever be compatible with the 
  requirements of the Convention, however much it may be said that the 
  proceedings have become protracted by reason of the behaviour of one or other 
  or both parents. Unhappily, the present case is far from unique. In <I>Re M 
  </I>there was what Wall J referred to (at para [19]) as "inexcusable delay". 
  In <I>Re O </I>there were what he referred to (at para [52]) as "very 
  substantial delays". This is merely the (reported) tip of the iceberg. 
  Everyone involved in the family justice system will know from their own 
  experience or anecdotally of many such cases. At about the same time as I was 
  dealing with this case I was involved in two other private law cases where 
  there had been equally unacceptable delays. I have had another since. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=46><A name=para46>Delay is the scourge of the family justice system. 
  There are many causes for this. They have been considered on many occasions, 
  most recently, in the context of public law proceedings under Part IV of the 
  Children Act 1989, by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Judicial 
  Case Management in Public Law Children Act Cases, whose final report in May 
  2003 led to the publication in June 2003 of the <I>Protocol for Judicial Case 
  Management in Public Law Children Act Cases</I> ("the Protocol") which came 
  into force on 1 November 2003: see <I>Practice Direction (Care Cases: Judicial 
  Continuity and Judicial Case Management) </I>[2003] 2 FLR 719 at p 798. The 
  Protocol addresses these problems in relation to public law cases. Nothing 
  effective has yet been done to address the equally pressing problems in 
  relation to private law cases. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=47><A name=para47>In relation to public law cases the Committee's 
  Report at para 4.1 stated the paramount objective of the Protocol as being to 
  improve the outcomes for children by reducing unnecessary delay. At para 4.2 
  it identified a number of key elements to the achievement of that paramount 
  objective, including "the highest practical level of judicial continuity and 
  case management" (para 4.2.1) and timetabling of all cases to final hearing at 
  the earliest practical stage and the reduction of intermediate hearings to no 
  more than four (para 4.2.3). This latter objective is to be achieved (see para 
  5.1(d) of the Practice Direction) by a case management conference, designed to 
  enable the case management judge to actively case manage the case and <I>at 
  the earliest practicable opportunity </I>to identify the relevant issues and 
  fix the timetable for all further directions and other hearings, including the 
  date of the final hearing. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=48><A name=para48>I see no reason why comparable principles should 
  not be applied in relation to all but the simplest or most straightforward 
  private law cases. Like Wall J (see <I>Re O </I>at para [57]) I have a strong 
  belief in judicial continuity. Like him (see <I>Re M </I>at paras [11], [19]) 
  I believe that judicial continuity in private law cases of any complexity is 
  essential, because, if delay is to be minimised, what he aptly referred to as 
  "strict judicial control" is required. <I>A v A</I>, as he pointed out at para 
  [9], was a private law case that clearly demonstrated the benefits of judicial 
  continuity. I do not suggest that private law cases need procedures as 
  complicated and prescriptive as those set out in the Protocol. But what is 
  needed is a corresponding Protocol which borrows from the public law context 
  the key principles of judicial continuity, case management and, most crucially 
  of all, timetabling. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=49><A name=para49>What is needed for effective case management in 
  private law cases? The key components are not too difficult to identify: </A>
  <P></P>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>i) Judicial continuity: Every private law case of any complexity 
    must be allocated to a single or at most two judges. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>ii) Timetabling: The allocated judge must set an overall 
    timetable for the case at the earliest practicable stage. The simpler cases 
    should be timetabled to last weeks rather than months. Even serious and 
    complex cases should be timetabled so that they are concluded within a 
    period measured in months rather than years. 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>iii) Strategy: Proper judicial control and judicial case 
    management requires what Wall J referred to in <I>Re M </I>at para [115] as 
    "consistency of judicial approach" within the context of a judicially set 
    "strategy for the case". This must form what he described at para [118] as 
    "part of a wider plan for [the] children, which … needs to be thought 
    through." 
    <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=50><A name=para50>What are the elements that go to make up an 
  appropriate strategy for the case? There are no simple answers, for no two 
  cases are the same. All one can do is to draw attention to a number of 
  possible approaches that need to be borne in mind. I consider some of them, in 
  no particular order. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=51><A name=para51>As Wall J pointed out in <I>Re M </I>at para [15], 
  intractable contact disputes are one of the "prime categories" for separate 
  representation of the children. I agree. I also agree that in this situation 
  the court can with great advantage make use of organisations such as the 
  National Youth Advisory Service (NYAS), an organisation whose assistance in 
  <I>A v A </I>was justifiably lauded by Wall J (see at paras [24], 
  [131]-[133]). </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=52><A name=para52>But children caught up in intractable contact 
  disputes may need more than the forensic assistance of a guardian. Guardian's 
  reports, though immensely valuable, may not be enough. The children may need a 
  social worker who can remain with them long enough to form a long-term 
  relationship (see <I>Re M </I>at para [127]). The children and their warring 
  parents will often need and can often benefit from skilled social work 
  intervention. That was the thinking that lay behind the appointment of the 
  independent social worker in the present case by the Circuit Judge on 31 
  August 2001: her most vital function was to facilitate the implementation of 
  overnight contact. Sometimes this will work, at least in part. <I>A v A 
  </I>provides a striking example. Sometimes it will not work. In the present 
  case it did not, largely I think because the independent social worker first 
  came on to the scene far too late, and at a time which can be seen, albeit 
  perhaps only with the priceless advantage of hindsight, to have been well 
  after the point at which the situation was in all probability wholly 
  irretrievable. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=53><A name=para53>We need to get away from the idea that experts are 
  there simply to provide the court with reports. Directing reports can all too 
  often turn into a source of further delay. "Is your expert really necessary?" 
  is a slogan that has its uses. In this kind of case experts and other outside 
  agencies can often be much more use helping to facilitate contact rather than 
  writing reports – preparing mother and child for contact, actually being there 
  at hand on Saturday morning to make sure that hand-over takes place, or even 
  acting as the go-between if mother cannot bring herself to meet father and 
  there is no independent friend or relative who can help. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=54><A name=para54>False allegations of misconduct are highly 
  damaging and destructive. I agree with Wall J when he said in <I>Re M </I>at 
  para [12]: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In an intractable contact dispute, where the residential parent 
    is putting forward an allegedly factual basis for contact not taking place, 
    there is no substitute … for findings by the court as to whether or not 
    there is any substance to the allegations."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The court should grasp the nettle. Such allegations should be speedily 
  investigated and resolved, not left to fester unresolved and a continuing 
  source of friction and dispute. Court time must be found – and found without 
  delay –for fact finding hearings. Judges must resist the temptation to delay 
  the evil day in the hope that perhaps the problem will go away. Judges must 
  also resist the temptation to put contact 'on hold', or to direct that it is 
  to be supervised, pending investigation of the allegations. And allegations 
  which could have been made at an earlier stage should be viewed with 
  appropriate scepticism. Once findings have been made, everybody must 
  thereafter approach the case on the basis of the facts as judicially found. As 
  Wall J said in <I>Re M </I>at para [128], "these are not questions which can 
  be reopened." He went on to point out that if a parent persists in assertions 
  contrary to such judicial findings, that is plain evidence of a refusal to 
  recognise reality and what is in the interests of the children.</P>
  <LI value=55><A name=para55>A vital component in the strategy is the 
  appropriate judicial response if and when things start to go wrong. One key 
  element here, which I suspect is often not addressed, is the need for a clear 
  and hard-headed approach to the timetable. There is a very difficult balance 
  to be held. It was, if I may be allowed to say so, clearly put by the 
  President in <I>Re S </I>when she observed at para [33] that: </A>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"It is … most important that the attempt to promote contact 
    between a child and the non-resident parent should not be abandoned until it 
    is clear that the child will not benefit from continuing the 
  attempt"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>having previously commented at para [29] that:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"One aspect of proportionality which has to be weighed in the 
    balance is the length to which a court should go to force contact on an 
    unwilling child and on the apprehensive primary carer. At this point the 
    factor of proportionality becomes all-important since there is a limit 
    beyond which the court should not strive to promote contact and the court 
    has the overriding obligation to put the welfare of the child at the 
    forefront and above the rights of either parent."</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI value=56><A name=para56>Too often at present, once things start going 
  wrong, it takes too long – too often far too long – to get in front of a judge 
  who is in a position to take potentially decisive action. Judicial case 
  management where the case is allocated to a single judge affords real 
  opportunities to combat this problem, particularly if the parties are able to 
  communicate with the judge, and the judge with the parties, by fax or e-mail. 
  Other things being equal, swift, efficient, enforcement of existing court 
  orders is surely called for at the first sign of trouble. A flabby judicial 
  response sends a very damaging message to the defaulting parent, who is 
  encouraged to believe that court orders can be ignored with impunity, and 
  potentially also to the child. Thus, it may in some cases be appropriate for a 
  judge who has concerns as to whether the contact ordered for Saturday will 
  take place to include in the order a direction requiring the father's 
  solicitor to inform the judge on Monday morning by fax or e-mail if there have 
  been any problems, on the basis (also spelt out in the order so that the 
  mother can be under no illusions as to what will happen if she defaults) that 
  the mother will thereupon be ordered to attend court personally on Tuesday 
  morning and immediately arrested if she fails to attend. The problem can then 
  perhaps be nipped in the bud. There is no reason why in a case of serious 
  recalcitrance or defiance where it is possible to establish a breach of the 
  order the court should not, then and there, make an immediate suspended 
  committal order, so that the mother can be told in very plain terms that if 
  she again prevents contact taking place the following Saturday she is likely 
  to find herself in prison the following week. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=57><A name=para57>It may be that committal is the remedy of last 
  resort but, as Wall J recognised in <I>Re M </I>at para [115], the strategy 
  for a case may properly involve the use of imprisonment. Interestingly he 
  seems to have accepted (see at para [117]) that imprisonment even for a day 
  might in some cases be an appropriate tool in the judicial armoury. I agree. A 
  willingness to impose very short sentences – one, two or three days – may 
  suffice to achieve the necessary deterrent or coercive effect without 
  significantly impairing a mother's ability to look after her children. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=58><A name=para58>I emphasise that these are only ideas, and that 
  they are far from being comprehensive. There are no simple solutions. And it 
  is idle to imagine that even the best system can overcome all problems. The 
  bitter truth is that there will always be some contact cases so intractable 
  that they will defeat even the best and most committed attempts of judges. But 
  that is no reason for not taking steps – urgent steps – to improve the system 
  as best we can. </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI value=59><A name=para59>Whether an improved system would have provided a 
  better outcome for this child and this father is now almost impossible to 
  know. Perhaps it would. Perhaps not. But they were denied the chance of a 
  better outcome, and for that they deserve a public, albeit necessarily 
  anonymous, apology. We failed them. The system failed them. </A>
