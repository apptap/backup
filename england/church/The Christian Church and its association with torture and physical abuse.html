            <blockquote> 
              <p> <i>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels 
                of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I received 
                of my Father. </i>Revelations 2:27 
              </p><p> Up to the fifth century AD Christians seem to have an inkling 
                that there was something morally questionable about torture and 
                killing. Christian torturers and executioners generally delayed 
                their own baptism until just before death. The Church assured 
                them that any sins of which they might have been guilty were thus 
                washed away, and no lasting harm was done to their immortal souls. 
                For the next thousand years and more, when Christianity was at 
                the height of its power, the Church regarded brutality and killing 
                as perfectly acceptable, and no such precautions were thought 
                necessary. Mutilation, branding and flogging were commonplace. 
                The Church found it acceptable for people to be flogged for the 
                most trivial offences, even for things that are not now considered 
                offences at all. Amongst them were vagrancy, drunkenness, drinking 
                on a Sunday, having an illegitimate baby, even for contracting 
                smallpox. 
              </p><p> Torture had been used as punishment and as a method of eliciting 
                information in ancient times, but thinkers like Seneca and Cicero 
                had recognised both its injustice and its futility as a means 
                of discovering the truth. Such ideas did not impress Christians, 
                and as we shall see (The Inquisition page 364) the Church was 
                responsible for introducing torture into almost all European penal 
                systems, without any of the original roman safeguards. . 
              </p><p> In England the provisions of Magna Carta (which had been denounced 
                by the Church) had been interpreted as representing torture to 
                be abhorrent to the principle of English freedom, and the Common 
                Law did not permit its use . When two Inquisitors were sent to 
                England in 1310 to extract confessions from Knights Templars, 
                they insisted on using torture . The king allowed some torture 
                to be applied "according to ecclesiastical law", but 
                apparently not enough to satisfy the Inquisitors. The Pope wrote 
                to the King:
              </p><blockquote>
                <p> We hear that you forbid torture as contrary to the laws of 
                  your land; but no state can override Cannon Law, Our Law; therefore 
                  I command you at once to submit these men to torture...Withdraw 
                  your prohibition and we grant you remission of sins </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>(Letter from Pope Clement V to King Edward II of England. Regestum 
                Clementis Papae V, nunc primum editum cura et studio Monachorum 
                Ordinis S. Benedicti, (Rome, 1885-92) year 5, no. 6670, pp 84-6. 
                . The English translation is quoted from G. G. Coulton, Medieval 
                Panorama, (CUP, 1947) p 380. Clement was asking for the Templars 
                to be taken to Ponthieu, in Edward's French territories, where 
                the Inquisitors could work normally. It seems likely that the 
                Inquisitors could not get the results they wanted in England because 
                the civil authorities were insisting that the rules be followed, 
                and that the tortures applied should not cause permanent injury 
                or violent effusion of blood. These rules were routinely ignored 
                in France, and nearly all French Templars either died under torture 
                or else confessed to charges put to them. For a full account of 
                this whole sad business see Barber, <i>The Trial of the Templar</i>s, 
                especially pp 197-199. )
              </p><p>In the seventeenth century James Felton defied Archbishop Laud's 
                threats of torture on the rack and the matter was referred to 
                the courts. As a result the common law was confirmed and torture 
                was definitively declared to be unlawful in England. In 1689 the 
                Bill of Rights explicitly prohibited its use, so now it was banned 
                by statute as well. 
              </p><p> Elsewhere, torture was a favourite method of extracting confessions 
                for offences both real and fabricated. Its use was explicitly 
                sanctioned by Pope Innocent IV in 1252 in his bull <i>ad extirpanda</i>. 
                Inquisitors and their assistants were permitted to absolve one 
                another for applying torture. It was applied liberally to obtain 
                whatever confessions were required, and sometimes just to punish 
                people that the Church authorities did not like. 
              </p><p> The voices raised against the use of torture were all secular. 
                Early critics like Juan Luis Vives, Johann Graefe and Montaigne 
                were regarded by the Church as its enemies. In 1740 Frederick 
                the Great abolished torture in Prussia and around the same time 
                Voltaire lent his voice to opposing the use of torture in France, 
                where Churchmen were still intent on torturing and killing people 
                for trivial offences like those of the Chevalier de la Barre).Despite 
                the opposition of the Churches, secular powers succeeded in abolishing 
                torture: in Italy in 1786, in France in 1789, in Spain in 1812, 
                and so on. The use of torture by Inquisitors was nominally banned 
                by Pope Pius VII in 1816, but a blind papal eye was turned to 
                its continued use for another twenty years or so. 
              </p><p> Paschal I (pope 817-824) blinded his opponents before beheading 
                them. He was made a saint. Hadrian III (pope 884-885) was also 
                keen on blinding his political opponents and once had a woman 
                whipped naked through the streets of Rome. He too is now a saint. 
                Over the centuries the Roman Church tortured, flogged, branded, 
                and killed countless thousands of people, many of them for crimes 
                which no longer exist. Mutilation was a common punishment throughout 
                Christendom. For example a Crusader who struck another and drew 
                blood was liable to have a hand chopped off. Other offenders suffered 
                the removal of limbs, or of the nose, ears, lips, tongue, or genitals. 
                Branding was used to disfigure bodies, arms, hands, cheeks and 
                foreheads. Penitent heretics were branded with a cross. A fray-maker 
                in church might expect to be branded with the letter F, and a 
                blasphemer with the letter B. 
              </p><p> Bishops' courts in England passed sentences of whipping and 
                branding even on their own clerics. The great English saint Thomas 
                Becket was one of many who had recourse to the branding iron . 
              </p><p> For many centuries Christian missionaries secured conversions 
                by offering a choice between adopting the Christian religion and 
                instant death. By the late Middle Ages this was seen to be a little 
                harsh. Christian missionaries now routinely used torture to secure 
                converts and to punish those who did not live up to requirements. 
                Such practices had been assumed to have been abandoned during 
                the Enlightenment, at least by Protestants, but a flurry of cases 
                were exposed in Victorian times. In 1880 it was disclosed that 
                a Free Church of Scotland mission to Nyasaland maintained a pit 
                prison in which a man had died after receiving two hundred lashes. 
                It turned out to be common for people to be given a hundred lashes, 
                and sometimes salt was rubbed into their open wounds. A few years 
                later a Nigerian woman died having had red pepper rubbed into 
                her wounds after a beating. Such cases caused a scandal among 
                European sceptics. Churches became more cautious about their methods, 
                but such techniques may well have been used into the twentieth 
                century.
              </p><p> While the Church held sway, it supported all manner of absurdity 
                and horror. It was the custom for Christian teachers to punish 
                a servant lad when a royal pupil had misbehaved. (This is the 
                origin of the term whipping boy.) As long as someone suffered, 
                justice was somehow thought to have been done. Such an inequitable 
                concept was comfortably accommodated within the Church. Corporal 
                punishment has always featured strongly in Church Schools until 
                recent times, but it was not confined only to schools. When society 
                shared common Christian mores corporal punishment was widespread: 
                it was practised extensively in Christian seminaries, monasteries, 
                convents, orphanages, mental hospitals, armies, navies, prisons, 
                and homes. Sentences of corporal punishment were handed down by 
                courts in England until 1946. Birching was practised in British 
                prisons until 1968.
              </p><p> For more than a thousand years Christianity set the standards. 
                During that time many suffered physical abuse. Prisoners were 
                tortured in Bishops' torture chambers. Noses were split, ears 
                cropped, tongues bored, backs whipped, foreheads and cheeks branded, 
                limbs crushed or cut off. And it was not only prisoners who suffered. 
                Slaves were thrashed to death. Uncooperative potential converts 
                were physically coerced. The insane were tortured by monks and 
                nuns. Christian parents beat their children. Christian Schoolmasters 
                beat their pupils. Christian husbands beat their wives. Canon 
                law specifically permitted wife-beating, so it took place at level 
                of society. All this has changed through the gradual adoption 
                of secular ideas, and the Churches have now ceased to oppose such 
                changes. Now we learn from the mainstream Churches that Jesus 
                has always been against all kinds of beastly behaviour, and that 
                the correct Christian view is similar to that of modern liberal 
                social workers.
