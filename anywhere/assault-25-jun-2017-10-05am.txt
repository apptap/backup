On 25th June around 9:30am I entered the bathroom
in 114 to prepare to leave.

Within 10 minutes there was a knock on the door, but clearly the
bathroom was in use and therefore the person knocking ought to have sought
another bathroom as I was not in a state of preparedness to leave the bathroom.

However there were knocks on two more occasions that got progressively louder
and more aggresive in nature.

At this point I asked the person to stop banging the door and he then said he was going to hit my head or words to the effect that he was intending to commit an act of violence upon my person.

I was alarmed and distressed as the man was waiting outside the bathroom in an area where there was no CCTV and so I was concerned he may have struck out at me. However, I had no choice but to leave as quickly as possible and head to a safer location, so I left the room and went to the main reception.

Within minutes this man, who I had heard was called Ahmed, followed me to the reception and started speaking critically and confronted me and grabbed my throat.

I realized it may have been on CCTV and so thought there was a chance the police could help.

It was between 10:04 and 10:08 when the incident happened.

I phoned 101 as i thought that was the responsible thing to do as though an assault had taken place, I was not seriously harmed at that time.

Later in the day I noticed it was painful to swallow on the left side of my throat.
