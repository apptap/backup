 * Notice that "use_lvmetad" setting is enabled with USE="udev" in
 * /etc/lvm/lvm.conf, which will require restart of udev, lvm, and lvmetad
 * if it was previously disabled.
 * Make sure the "lvm" init script is in the runlevels:
 * # rc-update add lvm boot
 * 
 * Make sure to enable lvmetad in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf if you want
 * to enable lvm autoactivation and metadata caching.

 * To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
 * start the Docker daemon at boot, add Docker to the default runlevel:
 *   rc-update add docker default
 * Similarly for systemd:
 *   systemctl enable docker.service
 * 
 * To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:
 *   usermod -aG docker youruser
