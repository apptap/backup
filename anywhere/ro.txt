I know I have been quite unwell in the past.

I have been steadily getting better because I have seen where my ideas came to me from and I am not wanting to let those ideas get in the way of our lives.

I accept that you at your level of experience and the quality of life you were used to simply could not cope with me fearing for my safety and feeling the need for us to live in another country.

I am not afraid anymore and am prepared to live locally to make it easier to be with him and maybe one day, you.

If we made the effort to understand each other with love and time we could build a bridge and work it out it's all just been a huge misunderstanding partly because I was confused and had a blindspot and was overloaded with stress.

I am happy to meet nice people as a family and be part of a community I want to show him
integrating is good and on another note say to you that in case you didn't know I do realize our son would not have been born had your parents not been who they are so see we can find a way to work together and make it good. We must try for him, don't feel like my love is worthless because I still have the capacity to be there for you I am not a desperate type but I only have eyes and a heart for you two. If you really left as you stated to me for those reasons I understand, but that does not explain the communication block and I want to speak direct so I know I am getting the truth from the one most important to speak with - that's you. If you are a thief who planned this then that would explain a continued avoidance and unwillingness to make us a family for him me and you. People can understand each other with open talk and love and prepared to be really honest.

Please consider how important his birthday is and dont let me down again...Learn to feel it is the difference between living as a human and being a dead zombie.
